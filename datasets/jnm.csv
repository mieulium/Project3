1,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
2,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
3,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
4,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
5,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
6,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
7,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
8,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
9,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
10,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
11,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
12,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
13,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
14,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

16,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
17,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
18,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
19,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
20,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
21,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
22,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
23,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
24,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
25,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
26,"This happened a long time ago....

I typed success because these stories all ultimately have a happy ending. This is the Lady Tremayne saga...
My father is passed but if he were alive, he would be posting about my moms step mom...his SMIL.
I kinda binged the story earlier but deleted it because it deserves its own individual posts.

My real grandma died when I was 7 and then 2 years later my grandpa was remarried to this gem...
I didn't have a problem with her till I was 18 and I couldn't understand why my parents had such a problem with her until Lady Tremayne and my JYGP came out for my HS graduation.

In 2003 there was a tv show that was casting makeovers off the street and in the first season, was when we were approached on Mill ave in Tempe AZ.
We just finished lunch and were crossing the street when this fancy looking guy and his camera surrounded my mom like bees. They wanted her to be a part if their first season and listen up, my mom is gorgeous on her own, maybe a little dated in what she wears but gorgeous lady...
In a bout of ""hiss and fit"" Lady Tremayne makes some unintelligible noise and turns around and stomps off in the other direction. My mom was embarrassed and politely refused the offer from the camera men to tend to bitch face. I was disappointed for my mom to have this awesome moment about her, transition into a whine fest about Lady Tremayne. LT is a very self absorbed, self centered, Narcissist. She has moments of yes but they are few and far between. She spends all her money on jewelry and clothing and pinches pennies to help people, she is a self proclaimed lover of the word of God. ( I know that this behavior isnt an exact representation of what Christian people are.) This is just part of her awful self...i digress...

LT didnt say anything else till later in the day. Myself, was driving her and my JYGP to her nephews house. They are nice people and totally worth their salt. In the car she has the audacity to say in front of myself and JYGP that my mom was an idiot for turning down the street offer  earlier...(then I discovered my 18yo self had a shiny spine in development)
Verbatim:
LT:Didn't your mom want to be beautiful???!
Me: my mom doesn't need a TV show to be beautiful because she already is.
JYGP: There's more to beauty than what's on the outside LT. You dont need make up and garbage to show your worth.

*drop da mic*

She was silent for the rest of the day."
27,"So...I have FFF..her stepasshole who I am no contact with..I have a wonderful and amazing MIL (husbands bio mom)- now we get to the step-mil( husbands stepmom)..fuck my life.

Think of the movie Cinderella. The evil stepmother the two spoiled evil stepsisters and my DH being Cinderella. All they need is a cat named Lucifer. Thats what I'm dealing with.

So this woman came into my husbands life when he was young maybe 8-10 years old. She married his  father and had two daughters, husband's half sisters. This woman would constantly make his father pick between my DH or her and his daughters. Unfortunately, DH got the shaft and became everyones fix it guy and go to guy because he desperately wanted love and affection from the family. His father passes and instead of DH getting anything of his father..he gets nothing not even pictures of him and his dad which was all he wanted. (Thanks lady)

Cue me and DH getting together and married. This woman tried to make a smear campaign against me to the family and become gate keeper.

Her favorite game was to not tell me (who handles all the family schedules and events) when things were then tell family we were just being assholes  and didn't want to come.

Until I beat her at her own game. One by one I met each family member..I became friends around her. Then next family event I became best friends with the Matriarch so to speak of the family...who now adores me. 

Somehow at the next famile event step-mil tried smear campaign again only to realize while she didn't see us outside at first and started running her mouth- As she is saying we were once again jerks for not showing up (we came early to help cook and set up for the bbq) I walked up behind her and stated.

""Oh you must of been confused, we always want to be at family events
You just never gave us the dates and times..its ok Aunt Will be telling me from now on. Maybe you should get checked out for dementia if you are having such a hard time remembering things""

I put down the tray of food down and walked away. (Pictures of the BBQ shark from this event on my profile)

I play chess not checkers, queen I win.

But seriously, this woman tried the whole time to run me out of conversations- so I just stepped physically in front of her and continued my conversation with a smile. 

Now the holidays are coming up and its already starting.

Let the games begin."
28,"Half Rotten Peach is returning. My husband told me last night that his mother let him know that she’s coming into town this sat and because she’ll be driving three hours, she’s going to need to stay the night. He then hesitantly asked me “if the spare room was going to be ready?”  I said a prompt nope and that she would have to stay with his sister. His father and I have been busy building outdoor shelters for the animals when the weather permits, so it isn’t like I’ve been sitting on my butt. He then said his mother mentioned she spoke to me, and I said yes. She wanted to thank me for taking care of you when you had your wisdom teeth out. She also said that she must have misremembered how bad the pain was when her wisdom teeth were taking out due to pain meds. 🤦🏼‍♀️ why do people thank you for taking care of your spouse? I find it weird and patronizing"
29,"Long time lurker, first time poster. So MIL is a manipulative and verbally abusive creature who enjoys yelling at my poor old, meek, and feeble FIL. In the 10 years since my DW and I got married and she left the house, MIL has become a hoarder and turned every room of the house into storage for her trash. The poor and soft-spoken FIL is no match for this demon and despite being the only one who works and provides income, FIL has become nothing more than just a speck on the wall in MIL's world as she runs the show and calls all of the shots.

My DW and I finally had a child after years of trying and unfortunately had no choice but to have MIL babysit on occasion. All was well when our child was an infant and slept all day in the crib, but I deemed every room in that house unsafe for a crawling toddler and was nervous when my child finally began to explore his surroundings. The nail in the coffin was the day I found out about the cat ""litter"". MIL is incredibly cheap and thrifty and would go to great lengths to save a penny. She regularly went through the trash of all of her tenants (to recycle the cans and plastic bottles that tenants were mixing with the regular trash).

Ok no big deal I guess as home owners in this area could get fined for having recyclables inside the regular trash. But then I discovered that she was also rummaging through the bathroom trash bags and sorting through them to find ""lightly used toilet paper"" (you know, the ones you wipe with last just to make sure you're all clean down there) MIL was apparently taking these sheets of toilet paper and using them to line the cat litter box because she was too cheap to purchase cat litter. YOU READ RIGHT. My MIL collected USED sheets of toilet paper from the trash of her tenants to use as ""cat litter""!

Needless to say, that was the last day my child stayed at that house and MIL could not understand why. She found nothing wrong with the fact that her 5 cats (mayber 6?) would step all over the used toilet paper and then run off into the house and spread God knows what all over the carpets while my child dragged his body all across the floor. She DEMANDS to my DW that we bring the child back but I have forbidden it until she cleans up her act. My FIL, DW, and SIL are all deathly afraid of her because she incessantly yells and berates them, but MIL fears and avoids me because she once tried doing the same to me and I got in her face and dished it back.  Am I wrong for refusing to allow her to babysit my child in that filthy, disgusting house?

\*EDIT\*  I've been working long hours and do not have time to reddit at work and came home to hundreds of comments! I went through them all and it seems I have left out some details and left you guys with more questions than answers.

Yes I truly believe MIL is mentally ill but she has never been diagnosed because her family just thinks she is weird or quirky. I noticed fairly early on in my relationship with my then-GF and have expressed my concerns to her but she just brushed it off as having a ""weird mom"". I also learned that MIL witnessed her mom commit suicide when she was a young girl and that may be the source of all of her underlying issues. Apparently they were swimming in a river in her birth country and MIL's mom drowned herself by lunging into the deep end when she could not swim. MIL is now in her mid 60s and since that traumatic day, she has not stepped foot in any body of water deeper than her ankles. She would not even dip her feet in a 3 foot deep inflatable pool I set up for the kids for fear of drowning.

Also, the ""cat litter"" is just the tip of the iceberg. MIL always accidentally cuts herself as she is very clumsy around sharp things. I guess this is probably a good time to mention that SHE REUSES BANDAGES. Like blood-soaked bandages. As long as the blood has dried the bandage is fair game for a second go around. I'm not sure how she gets the adhesive to keep sticking for so long."
30,"Background: SO and I have been together for 15 years. He was living independently and gainfully employed. He took on my 5 year old like a champ and we’ve always worked together on making ends meet. We have never been rich but we got bills paid and kept a roof over our heads. About 5 years ago I had a medical issue that kept me from working for a while. Up to this point MIL had only been mildly annoying like telling me how to parent and giving unsolicited advice. When I got sick she started spreading rumors to our mutual friends that I really was just being lazy and didn’t want to work. 
Then she had to have a knee replacement surgery. She would be in rehab for six to eight weeks and then almost a year of recovery. 
SO thought it would be easier on us to move in with her and help care for her dogs and the house while she was recovering. I wasn’t too keen on this because she is a hoarder and tends to use people’s kindness the pony of stupid, I saw myself getting used in the long run but we were having a tough time with rent and our lease was coming up and was going to increase beyond our budget. My DD who was 16 refused to move in too bc she and MIL butt heads hard. She moved with my parents. I was sad about this but it was better for everyone. Fast forward to that next Christmas and I decided to go home for the holidays because my dad was insistent that the family be together. It was odd but we pulled it off and it was lovely. One week later my father was killed in a car wreck. Obviously this extended my stay and I was a basket case as my father and I were incredibly close. 
When I got home I was in a deep depression and SO was very understanding and took my mood swings in stride. MIL not so much. She made me feel ashamed of my grief and kept trying to make it about her and her needs. I needed to get back into my routine so I felt normal. My “routine” being waiting on her hand and foot as she had taken to camping in her recliner chair and using a commode. Her calling me on my cell when she was hungry in the am for her breakfast and me running all errands and picking up pills and groceries (with our money). I paid all the bills. (Again with our money.) she said it was because she allowed us to live there rent free so she expected us to pay all the bills. At the time SO worked for the state in a mental hospital. He made good money and it was ok. However, he was severely injured by a client and ended up having to have three shoulder surgeries and a back surgery. So now I’m taking care of him as well. But that’s my job. 
One day he hears his mother telling a friend how she “takes her lunch at 1230p” and needs to be home. That was his breaking point and he told her that she either needed to start doing things for herself or get a nurse. 
I had been looking for work for a little while but she had always whines about it and I gave in. This time I didn’t. Honestly I just needed something part time to get out of the house for a bit so I got a job at a local fast food joint. This was two years ago. I am an assistant manager and work appx 45-55hr a week. I’m that time though. It’s all gone to hell. SO has not gone back to work. His workman’s comp is long run out and his $400/mo temp disability runs out end of the year. He has insomnia and he and MIL have NO sleep regulation. They do NOTHING around the house unless I nag and piss. We still pay all the bills and groceries and essentials while she continues to play on Wish and HSN. I tried to claim the third bedroom as a craft room for myself as it wasn’t being used but for piles of useless things. She then decided that she “had to have use of her office” once SO cleaned it out. Refusing to allow me to move my craft desk and sewing machine in. Enough room for us both but no it’s her house and her rules. 
Six months later it’s just filled with her random crap again. 
Tonite she said “I need you to do something in the office and move your stuff out so I can use it” I haven’t had a day off in two weeks due to manager issues at work. 
She’s also complaining that we need to get all our things out of the garage and bedroom ( our bedroom ) because she needs more space. She wants to get rid of her storage units because they are too expensive. I asked her where we’d put it. Our own storage unit is full. “Well you can’t just get another one?”
Sooooo.. I get to pay for an extra storage unit because you don’t want to pay for yours. You want to encroach in my very little space that I don’t even feel like is mine anyway. But I pay all the bills and provide household needs. Yet no one can bring themselves to do dishes or laundry or sweep or mop. 
SO has gotten complacent because I think he is just done. He has to live with two strong willed women who want control of the household and he’s torn. I get it. But god dammit. I wish he would stick up for me once in a while. He used to be very man of the house and tell his mom off when she needed it. 
He even sat down and told her we would pay the power and the internet/streaming services. 
This worked out for three months until the water got turned off and she yelled at me for not paying the bill. One I never saw a bill ( I put power and internet on auto pay when we came to the aforementioned agreement )
And no one ever let me know it was overdue or that she needed help paying it. 
So I paid $550 to get that turned on. 
She claims she never agreed to pay the water and just went back to her old chant of “ I allow you to live her rent free so you need to pay the utilities”
I am able to scrap a small savings together for emergency use. Due to my SO she knows this. So every so often she has an emergency that she need help with. And bullies the money from us just to shut her up. 
I have ended up moving our savings to a separate bank account that only I have access to. 
I shouldn’t have to do that. 
Ok this ended up getting long and drawn out and I’m actually realizing that my MIL is an amateur compared to some of the pieces of work you ladies deal with. 
I feel disrespected and under appreciated. By both SO and MIL at this point. 
Since my father died my mom is alone half the country away and being taken advantage of my my sisters and my DD has moved out and started her life. 
It breaks my heart that I am so utterly stuck in my situation. I have no means to just up and move out. Rents in my city have skyrocketed to the point of impossible on just my job alone. 
Even if I manage to scrap something together for a trip home it’s guilted out of my hands and my biggest fear is being kicked out and having nowhere to go."
31,"This is an old story but I feel like it's a classic and I want to tell, with some other relevant behaviours from her, just because.

So when DH and I had been together about 3 years, we moved cities for work, moved in together after 2 years long distance and were just plain happy to be together and know our relationship survived!

This time coincided with JNMIL releasing some equity from her house or pension,i don't know, and she wanted her two sons to use it as a deposit to buy houses. Read that to be clear- she decided it was time for them.
At one family gathering she talked through her plans to everyone: 'I'm going to get DS1 to buy his house first, then once we've gone through that, I'll get DS2 (my DH) into a house, and then I'll be happy'.
Yes, then SHE would be happy.
Anyways, how lovely to be helped to buy a house. I'm not complaining about that.

So house hunting started, DH and I are living in a real mix of a town that we are new to, so finding a nice area was difficult and we realised we needed to do some driving around to find the right areas. JNMIL was fervently searching for houses for us on the internet, sending us houses she had found that we should see. She did not take well to bring told that we didn't like the area, but still she would not be put off. She HAD to be involved.
Eventually I decided we just needed to go view houses to see what we could get in our budget across areas. I decided to invite her along so she could feel involved. I made a load of appointments at houses that were not really on the table, but I wanted to see as research and to put our budget and tick list into context. JNMIL came along, not realising/knowing these were not serious contenders.
I then had a game of sport that afternoon, and left DH &amp; JNMIL after all the viewings. I get back and ask DH what he thought of the houses, one was surprisingly ok and I wanted his thoughts. 'We don't think that's the right one for X,y,z reasons' he says.
'who's WE?' I ask.
Him: blank face..
Me: WE haven't discussed anything yet, have WE?
In this moment, I (&amp; he) realise that she assumes complete brain washing control over him whenever she is in the vicinity. Several years on now, I see why, she just talks at people with opinions that she has no right to have, never mind share. And no awareness that she completely bulldozes people.

(Side note, this escapade backfired on me because whenever I saw her for about a year after, she would repeatedly tell me why the houses I chose to look at were all disasters and she knew it and she knew better than my judgement and what a disaster my house viewing choices were....)

So we find a house, annoyingly it is one that she found on the internet, even more annoying is that it is almost exactly the same as the house she lives in. She wants to visit after we move in. She wanted to come down THE DAY WE MOVED IN, but I shut that shit down and told DH to convince her that it would be better if she waited till 2 weeks later when our new bed would be delivered and we would have a spare bed and she could have dinner &amp; stay over (she lives 2 hours away).

So she comes to stay, we give her a tour. She comments the WHOLE time, oh it's just like mine, this is a bit different but you can make it like mine...etc.
We go into garage, my DH massive collection of sports kit (club's, pads, bats, sticks etc without being too specific) are in there. I say I want a shelf at the back of the garage to put his stuff on. She says 'oh no you don't want that, you need hooks and blah blah...'. no filter or awareness that it is not HER HOUSE.
We go inside, we show her our new bed, it's got storage underneath. I say my sport kit is in there (I refer this time to shirts, socks, shorts, but clothing).
Without any further questioning or understanding, she jumps in and snaps at me:
'OH! So YOU make your DH keep his kit in the garage, but YOU can keep YOUR kit in the bedroom.....?'

Errr no, his clothing is also in his storage in his side of the bed, the 'kit' outside in the garage is large, smelly or just plain does not belong inside the house.

Well, there it is. She genuinely thought I was being mean to my DH, that I treat him like a lesser person than myself and he is being made to live in misery because his wife is a self-centred diva that thinks she's more important than him.

Obviously this is not the case. DH and work hard to be fair to each other, he had no issue with his 'kit' bring in the garage- it was one item on the house hunting list that he said was non-negotiable because he needed it for his kit.
Such a bitch, she will always assume that I'm a bitch and treating her precious son badly (he is golden son). She has had no reason to believe that, I assume it's just the conclusion she's come to because there is no other reason that he would choose to move away from her and escape from her emotional marriage to him."

I started to write a long post, but... I got about halfway through and had to stop.

33," So two weeks ago my MIL reached out to my husband about getting together for a birthday dinner. On Monday he called her to figure out details, etc. She is a realtor and has a closing in our state which is why she reached out in the first place. Not like she would ever go out of her way to do dinner with her son on his birthday if she didn’t already have a reason to be here. She told my husband that she didn’t know when her closing was yet and it might be at night so she would have to do lunch with him. My job is literally a closing coordinator for a mortgage company. My job is to schedule and perform closings and all things that involve closings. It is what I do. And let me tell you I have never ever had a closing be done at night time. ever. The latest closing I had was 5:30pm. No one does closings at night. I just don’t think she wants to see me because she knows I wouldn’t be at lunch, only my husband would be able to go to lunch with her. She also brought up yet again why I deleted her, which my husband yet again didn’t answer. So clearly she is still upset and fixated on that. 

I just wanted to be able to stand up for myself. I wanted to be able to answer that question to her face and now I don’t think I will be able to. I mean honestly I would rather not see her, but I am still a bit bothered. She knows what she is doing. She isn’t stupid. If she does do lunch with just my husband it will just be her talking about me the whole time. 

While my husband and her were on the phone she also invited us to come for Thanksgiving and my husband quickly shot that down, and told her no we already had plans for thanksgiving. Then she said well you need to come visit at some point during the month of November since your sister will be home from school. Actually no we don’t have to go visit, and I was so proud of my husband because for the first time that I can remember he said no to her twice about two different occasions and told her that we can’t visit because we already have a lot going on in the month of November. 

Anyways. That is my rant for the day. We will see if I actually get to see this clown tomorrow and tell her in person why she is deleted from social media. Will keep you all updated."
34,"Not me but My Grandmother on my dad's side
Character's EG- EG Grandma so this is my moms ex-MIL

So this is how EG is straight up Evil.
 So EG was/is a terrible woman List of SOME of the things she's done not in order of evilness
1) Left my dad in the worst part of their country at 10 years old alone for 5+ years until one of his uncles found him and took him
2) Did many drugs purposely to abort him (he was a result of her sleeping w/my grandfather who was married and rejected her after finding out)
3) When coming to the U.S. she purposely didn't tell him and left him in their home country but took all of his siblings 
4) When he found out and called her she told wished him dead,told him he should have died at the womb,then EG laughed in his face and hung up the phone.
5) When my dad got to the U.S. and got deported she cebrated in church by dancing.
6) When my parents got married (he got a green card) she tried to poison my mom in retaliation.
7) She alienated my brothers and I from the dad's side of the family and we get dirty looks whenever we see them.

EDIT: We do have contact with my uncle and his kids but that's it"
35,"My mother in law is a bully, plain and simple. After I had my first and only child a few years ago, she seemed to think the baby was hers (she literally told me this after refusing to respect our wishes of having three weeks of no visitors after our son was born. She said ""he's not just yours, he's ours too ). When it become clear that her expectations about her role as grandmother did not match our own, she resorted to passive aggressive bullying, smear campaigns, blame shifting, victimization, and she intentionally violated boundaries of ours
when left to babysit. We tried temporarily  cutting them off for 6 or so months but that basically dismantled my husband's entire family and the flying monkeys started swarming in. 

We think that maybe at this point, giving her SOME limited supervised contact (on neutral territory) with our son may be less stressful than cutting her off completely and dismantling the entire family. However, I do not want her to have an emotionally close relationship with my son because I have no doubt that at some point down the road, she will try and drive a wedge in his relationship with me (in the same way she tried to do in my marriage). 

So my question is this: how much contact should we establish while also keeping her from developing a real relationship with our son? Maybe one day every 4 months with a few video chats spread out over the year? Or is that too much? Should we just limit all her contact to video chats and if so, how often should we video chat per year? I need input."
36,"Stupid Bitch is my JNmother, she plays at being stupid but is really just a bitch. This story is old as dirt, but feel free to have your say. 

tw:sadism

As I've said in other posts &amp; comments, part of why I had a hard time seeing SB's abuse for what was is because she let other people do the dirty work for her. Oh sure, SHE didn't hit me, but never stopped my father from doing it. This is another one of those abuse by proxy situations. I wanted to write it out for therapeutic reasons after reading about all other sorts of medical themed sadism in the comments of another post. 

~*~*~*~
So when I was very young, my parents &amp; us kids all went to the same doctor. His office was in this narrow building with rooms on both sides (offices on the right, exam rooms on the left). I have very few clear memories from that time because of how abusive my past was, but I know we often went (as a family) to the doctor's office. And for whatever reason, my parents would sit and hang out with him chatting for HOURS. And I mean hours. Now my jnfather had ADHD and he didn't know time management to save his life, so that could be part of it. I really don't know why though. So we'd be there till after dark sometimes. And me and my sister would just wander around the empty building because it was the late 80's and there were not TVs or anything and all the books were medical books. If we stayed late enough the building's custodian-type person would show up. He was a very scruffy European dude, with a scruffy voice and a deep accent. Nothing wrong with that, but to a timid and alone ~7yr old he wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be around. He was scary to me, easy enough to understand.

I really don't know what his whole job was, only that he changed the garbage. Now, this Garbage Man was not a very nice dude. He had these massive, industrial sized black garbage bags that he used to change the garbage. I was a really tiny kid so it is hard to say how big they actually were, but compared to me they were massive. And he'd open them up and chase me around the building. The whole time calling after me, ""You want to get in the garbage bag, Little Girl?"". 

Needless to say I was terrified. Who wouldn't be? I would run, screaming and begging for help.

BOTH MY PARENTS AND THAT STUPID, USELESS DOCTOR WOULD LAUGH AT ME! And of course the Garbage Man thought it was fuckin' hilarious, too.

It happened every time we were there that late, and that happened pretty often. I would curl up and hide under the waiting room chairs and scream. But no one ever came. No one ever comforted me. And just writing this out, it's like I'm back there and I can feel that terror again. And I'll never understand why they did it. I can sort of chalk up my parents' bad behavior to their overall abuse arch, but the doctor? The cleaning guy? What did they get out of it?

My mother of course, the dirty double-dipper, loved to retell stories like this. She always wrote herself as the innocent party...but she never did anything to stop it. Even in her 'virtuous' retellings. Stupid Fucking Bitch. 

I've got a therapist, we're workin' through stuff like this. I'm hella damaged, but I do what I can. Writing stuff out here and sharing experiences with you guys helps a lot."
37,"To set the scene. Living with MIL as our landlord sold our house and due to brexit we're waiting to see what happens before we take on another expensive lease. 

Anyhou, I currently have anaemia due to my endometriosis. I also have chronic IBS so taking tablets is no go. The doctor told me due to the tiredness/fainting etc I need to get my iron levels up quick, so I need to eat nearly raw (blue) lean meat and eating oranges and drinking cold pressed OJ. 

Cool. living with MIL (for Roald Dahl readers she is a vermicious knid ). MIL and her husband live a pretty nice life, 4 + two/three week long holidays a year to expensive locations etc, always out 4-5 times a week with friends. I on the other hand, never shop, charity buy, walk to avoid public transport, never go out, you know the deal, starving artist and I'm frugal.

I need to eat meat like this currently at least 4 times a week. Every-time I cook it, I receive comments like this....

""Oh how the other half live""

""Must be nice to be able to eat steak every-night""

""You should get DH to teach you how to cook something cheaper""

""You should eat spinach instead of steak.""

 Me ""The doctor told me to have some spinach sure, but if I can eat meat, eating lean rare meat with oj is a much faster way to very quickly absorb iron."" MIL ""No but cook a whole bag of spinach"" Me ""I already asked the doctor, they said it won't be enough to get my iron levels up quick enough to avoid getting the shot"" MIL goes on and on, my enjoyment of dinner ruined, eating off a plate in my room to avoid more comments. URGH.

ARGGGHHHHHHH Why would I take the pushy 'advice' of women with only a high school education over a doctor with a medical degree???? She is always trying to make me feel shit about spending money when she is a total spend thrift. 

I HATE HER. How do I politely (She is a awful I don't want to get in an argument, she steamrolls everyone in her way) shut her down. ATM politely saying my doctor recommended steak and oj isn't working.

This is the same woman who pushed me into having a planned miscarriage because of an unviable pregnancy at home in their house instead of the privacy of a hotel like I wanted, and it ended up giving me PTSD.

Also on a BEC note. She is stupid stupid stupid with no manners. It's awful, but I went to a private school and finishing school, so feel like now my resentment of having to have this hob goblin in my life along with his other family is just making me very snobby. I'm not, my friends are from all walks of life but this is bringing something awful out and DH is being really great and shiny spined but I feel terrible I'm always telling him his family are disgusting..... Help me not be an arsehole.... He's improved loads from my being on here and my family are rubbish also, so I need some strategies to not vent and lay it all at his door..."
38,"So my husband and I are looking to get a kitten and MIL was kinda aware of it and knew of someone looking to sell 2 kittens together. She texted us about them and I thought one was cute. We didn’t get much info on them and decided we didn’t want to adopt two kittens, only one.

Today she emailed my husband saying:

“I probably should have asked you first yesterday in regards to the kittens...:)
But only sending this info onto you so you can have input first... the seller said they are willing to split the kittens up and your wife mentioned she liked the white kitten ... just letting you know if you think you guys would like it. I won’t mention it to her though if you dont”

Umm.. I am upset because I feel I was left out of the decision making. Any advice on how to handle this situation?"
39,"FTP, LTL

My (31F) SO (32M) is the only serious relationship I've had outside my regular social circle. We used to work together. After I left my old job we got together and recently we moved in together. Since we've been together he's commented on some the dynamics in my friendships and family relationships that I've gotten so used to I forgot they aren't normal. For example, a friend shouldn't repeatedly bruise you as a joke.

He made a comment about how my mum speaks to me, and it got me thinking about whether she's a little bit JustNo.

I'm not exactly slim or fit, but the other weekend SO and I went for (what I consider), a reasonable afternoon walk of about 7km. Mum will often badger me to exercise more and lose some weight, so I proudly mentioned the walk. She said ""That's just a coffee walk"". As in her and my dad would do that for a stroll before getting coffee. SO thought she was unfair and could have said ""Good for you"" or something instead.

SO mentioned that she isn't very supportive when I share small things I'm proud of, and she often points out that others can easily achieve more in the areas I'm insecure about. Since he's mentioned it, I can think of many instances where she's said something negative when I've been seeking encouragement. Is this something I should worry about?"
40,"I'm sensitive.  I know this.  I cry easily and my feelings tend to get hurt even when people don't mean to.  My SO used to call me his ""delicate flower"" which was always said in a sweet but joking manner.  However, in this case, I don't think I'm being overly sensitive (although please feel free to be honest if you think I am). 

Backstory - My SO died last October.  It was unexpected (but anticipated) and hit us all really hard.  He was a Marine who came back from Afghanistan with severe PTSD and an opioid addiction, and despite the number of times he tried desperately to get sober, he had far too many demons and ultimately died of an IV Heroin (Fentanyl) overdose.  He was the love of my life.  He was sweet, and funny and truly a good man who I miss every minute of every day.

His Mom is WONDERFUL.  I love her.  She and I were friendly when he was alive, but have become incredibly close since he died.  I went to her 3 days after we buried him and asked if she would be on board with me if I started a nonprofit foundation in his name in order to open a harm reduction, detox and recovery center.  Ultimately my goal would be to expand that to include long term therapy, housing and job placement - basically addressing all aspects of addiction in order to provide the most tools for success in recovery.  She was completely on board with this, and as of today we are officially a recognized nonprofit in our state and our federal application is being processed. 

MIL (just cause that's easier) and I do a lot of things together.  We attend a lot of functions related to veterans and a lot related to addiction.  We go to the cemetery together.  We go shopping and get our nails done and other fun things.  We talk pretty much every day either on the phone, or in Facebook messenger.  We genuinely enjoy each other's company.  

Sounds great right?  Except...sometimes she makes these ""jokes"" about me that truly hurt my feelings and I don't know what to do about it.  At first I thought I was being overly sensitive, but the longer it goes on the worse it feels.  They are mostly little remarks like she ""puts up with me"" or she's ""stuck with me"".  These are often said in front of others, including members of the community that we are making contacts with because they will help further our cause.  She is great at giving me credit for the Foundation and all the work that has been done to create it (HOLY CRAP a lot goes into starting a nonprofit!!!), but these little remarks are starting to add up and hurt.  

Here is an example:  Our Foundation has a Facebook page that I run.  I am the only one who posts on it, and I generally post whatever I want.  Today I posted something that I am aware is very controversial and after it went up, and sent the following message to our Board of Directors (which MIL and I sit on with 3 other people): 

""I post a lot on our Foundation’s Facebook page, and based on individual conversations I’ve had with you guys, I am pretty confident that I’m not saying anything that the majority of us don’t agree with.  That being said - if there ever comes a time that I post something that anyone strongly disagrees with, please bring it up so that we can discuss it as a group.  We are all part of this, and just because I’m the loudest, doesn’t mean only my opinion counts.""

Her response was ""You are a big mouth, but I'm used to it"".  I replied with ""Gee thanks.  You always know how to make me feel good about myself."" hoping she would realize that what she said was mean but that clearly backfired as her response was "" I try"" with a laughing emoji. 

Not only are my feelings hurt, but I'm embarrassed.   I love her son.  I am the driving force behind his legacy.  I am the one who gives him a voice now that he is gone.  I work INSANELY hard at making sure he is not forgotten and that his death has meaning.   It feels awful when she makes these comments, and it hurts even more when she does it front of other people.  

I have to find a way to GENTLY tell her this.  She isn't a very warm and fuzzy person.  She thinks her jokes are funny and doesn't even comprehend that what she is saying is hurting me.  How do I approach this?  This relationship is important to me....and she honestly doesn't even realize she this is a problem."
41,"I debated posting about this partly because I kind of get the reasoning of it, but at the same time, it annoys me.

Recap: I told MIL that I don't want her babysitting DD after she starts school. MIL had wanted to move close to us wherever that might be even though DD won't start school for at least a year to three years and she and FIL have been going back and forth on selling their current house or updating it.

A couple weeks ago when DH and I were talking about where we want to move, MIL chimed in and said she just has to stay in the area because she can't move away from GMIL (her mom). GMIL is in an assisted living home and has been declining due to lack of physical ability as well as dementia. The dementia has been getting scary and has been progressing for quite some time now. 

Now, it would be perfectly reasonable for MIL to go check on GMIL during the day and visit with her and then go pick up DD after school (were DH and I to allow her and if DD were in school now.) It just really annoyed me that MIL was willing to move upwards of an hour away from GMIL, but once I told her I didn't want her babysitting, suddenly she can't move away from GMIL. Really...?"
42,"
This may be just BEC, but I just wanted to vent. So like many JNMIL’s here, my MIL, MITM (monkey in the middle) likes to treat DH like her emotional Sonsband in my opinion. For reference, DH has three younger brothers. BIL1 is NC and lives in a different state with his dad (jyfil). BIL2 &amp; BIL3 are in grade school and live with MitM and sfil. He is not close with BIL2&amp;3 given the age gap. MitM is CONSTANTLY  texting (bombarding) DH about everything, especially his brothers. I’m talking 16 blurry pictures in a row from their sports game. Or “look at what BIL’s did today!” “BIL did this!” Or 28 pictures of “today things”. RANDOM things. I’m talking the dogs, her pantry, what she’s making for dinner, things she saw at the store, random signs, etc. 

What gets me the most is what she texts him about his two younger brothers. Once she forwarded DH and email from BIL1’s teacher. It was the THIRD day of school and it was all “he pushes boundaries and doesn’t listen” (wonder where he learned that from?) and she was all “do you think i should take him to a GT school?” “his teacher sent me this today”. I just feel like that’s a conversation to have with your HUSBAND. The father of BIL? She’ll say things like “did i tell you we went to parent teacher conferences today?”. Things like that I know are just BEC, but like DH doesn’t care!! They’re not his kids!! 

Recently there was an issue involving a substitute at a school in the district (not BILS school) for bullying a child. Sub was also BIL’s recreational sports coach. Mitm found out and then tried to press charges on sub/coach because he hugged BIL “too long” and kissed his forehead. Mind you, this was after they won their game, INFRONT of MitM. (not saying he innocent or whatever but she didn’t make a big deal ab it til he got in trouble as a sub) Mitm proceeds to text DH everything that’s happened (not much but she made it into a lot) and is all “do you think i’m doing the right thing?” “should i do this” “what do you think?”. And AGAIN I feel like this is a conversation for your HUSBAND. The child’s father?? 

She also messaged him once ranting about SFIL and how she doesn’t agree with his parenting and she feels like she has to be a buffer to the kids and how she’s not sure about him etc. Basically it was a whole rant that you would tell a close girl friend, not your son. I just feel like she tries to involve him in things that aren’t his place.  I feel like that’s inappropriate to talk to
your son about, but that may be just me. 

At the end of the day it’s not really my problem. I’m NC with her because when she texts, she sends 20+ messages in a row. I wish i was kidding. He brushes her off with short answers “i’m sure it’ll be okay.” “That’s cool” etc or just ignores her. It’s really just BEC because EVERYTHING she does irritates me."
43,"I wonder if I am the only one who has. She lives with us and we set up a camera to keep an eye on her when we're not home due to her Alzheimer's. We caught more than we bargained for. We caught her on camera just trashing me, talking mad trash, outright lying about me/us. She denied it, hubs showed her the proof. Needless to say, I now know the truth. I really despise her..."
44,"With the passing of the Canadian Thanksgiving,  our first Thanksgiving story came to my mind. 

Before I part of the family,  just BIL was married (ex-sister-in-law large family got together and after they got married MIL &amp; DH were invited,  DH never enjoyed it) in my family,  we females got together days before to coon together (so I knew how to bake, cook and make a real holiday dinner) . When I met DH, he had a male housemate.  A nice young man,  who was without family locally,  so we decided to have a ""orphan Thanksgiving dinner"", if you were a friend and didn't have any place to go, you're invited to our house for dinner.  

Now MIL didn't enjoy going to Ex-SIL family dinner,  so DH invited her.  I had my 2 youngest daughters, a couple of friends and our housemate had a couple of army buddies with no place to go.  

I made a 15lb Turkey, a ham. Homemade stuffing,  mash potatoes and gravy,  a veggie tray, homemade rolls, roasted root vegetables and brussel sprouts &amp; 4 or 6 pies. (Other than prep work,  I did all of the cooking myself)  

My father's family was wealthy once upon a time, my father insisted that my sister and I KNEW that proper way to set a table,  silverware and napkins.   I  had the table pre-set up (my mom's good silverware,  severing dishes,  all set waiting for me to finish setting the table.  My MIL came in &amp; tried to kick me out of my kitchen, started ordering my daughters to set the table (I didn't want it set vhf to early as we have cats) I had to get DH to get her out of my hair. 

MIL had a comment about everything I served. I thought my 17 year old daughter was going to kill MIL. 

I told DH, I really didn't want her to come the next year (he was pretty upset with her behavior too) the second year she invited herself.  It was worse."
45,"Recap: JNMIL demands we celebrate our wedding anniversary days before the holiday weekend, even though my husband was away on a business trip, because she didn't want us to steal her thunder on Thanksgiving.

Update: Thanksgiving turned out absolutely amazing with zero issues about our anniversary or even talking about it! At least, none that I could see. In fact, it went so beautifully that I imagine I will be getting a phone call this week from JNMIL to dictate how Christmas is going to go. 

Now I can almost hear you guys: ""NegBar, that's great and all, but that can't be it? She's crazy. You're saying there was zero drama?""

There might have been, if karma hadn't stepped in.

However, MIL helped herself to some chocolates that were hanging out in a relatives bag. Chocolates we were saving to enjoy the day a little better. Homemade fun chocolates, if you will. 

MIL does NOT partake in this now-legal activity and has very little idea that most of the family does.

So... JNMIL was high all Thanksgiving day. 

Best. Holiday. Ever. Aside from when she thought she was having a stroke and all the other relatives had to calm her down. Only after a bunch of questioning did we realize what had happened. 

Suffice to say, I was completely off the shit list as a result and had a great time. Especially when JNMIL could no longer keep it together enough to finish cooking, so me and my aunty stepped in to finish it up. 

And now we have further proof that JNMIL DOES snoop through unattended purses and bags when no one is looking. She tried to be mad, but everyone instead scolded her that she shouldn't be in people's bags, and should definitely not be eating unknown things! 

That was not how I thought it would go, but I can't say I am at all disappointed. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a while. 

Tempted to make SAFE chocolates for Christmas and see if she will even try them 🤣

Karma, bitch!"
46,"Guilt trip Nana stuck- “Can you call me?”

Where to begin to unpack...

Tears were launched immediately. A family member (her’s) is on the way out so I expected some, but she had launched her opening salvo into me- “why did I post something on -site name- but I couldn’t respond back to her messages?”

Some guilt trippy lines later and gaps of speech from me- “this isn’t you, what hold does -other-half have on you?” Ooh that made me mad. 

I tried to shine up my spine and gave some sharp retorts but she dug again “you’re different now, everyone notices this (who the f is everyone? They haven’t said anything to me.) Does he read your messages or your emails?” 
And her next gem “I never hurt you as a child and you were never abused as a child so I don’t know where any of this is coming from and if it something that is coming out recently you two need to get into therapy (her favorite out).” 

All the while she is saying this and my head is still in a “what?” state. I may be guilty of ignoring her messages because I don’t know how to respond without setting her off but I think it ultimately boils down to this

“I didn’t fore see becoming a grandma to go like this. I only get to see the kids once a month if that and you never invite us over, never initiate contact or invitations over. Is this how you want- to push everyone away? You were never like this when kid1 was born! (Dude I was in the fog so bad for the 2-3 years after kid1 was born) Just remember your grandparents are getting older, your siblings are getting older. We are getting older. Who else outside of your house do your kids interact with? Kid1 is in school and has school friends. What about kid2? Who do they interact with? We’re your family and live close by. And we’ll be moving soon. Is this how you want it to be? What about his parents? Do they call them? Do they video chat with the kids? Do they even know them?” 

I can’t articulate how lost this makes me feel. She is pulling a victim card and still believes my other half has sway over my thoughts and actions. But trying to get across how anxious  and draining the extended family is, is hard. I would love to have my kids visit but the boundary stomps are hard- especially since Nana believes that she hasn’t done anything wrong and still attempts to have me speak up and tell her. She tells me I was never like this. How the hell was I supposed to be myself when I was told to back down and be their doormat? When I was told to let things go, be the bigger person with things that happened in their house?

I have never changed my open door policy with her. The phone works both ways. Granted the past few messages I haven’t answered and here is why- she wanted to meet up on a free day of mine for lunch. Innocuous enough, but knowing her it is a way to corner me in public and shame me into doing what she wants. This is why I don’t like going out. And it’s that difference that she doesn’t get - I’m not her, my other half and I don’t like going out and doing the dating scene as we are home bodies. She believes we are hurting the kids by not giving them access “for the memories”.  

But the kicker to all this- she hung up on me."
47,"Since we moved away and had kids we haven't gone home or had my ILs over for the holidays. Usually they have had other ties to their area for Thanksgiving but not so much for Christmas. 

Now my holiday as kids was me and my siblings and my parents in the morning and family over in the afternoon.  I enjoyed this and want to recreate this. I won't be trekking thousands of miles on Christmas with my kids. If we were near the ILS we'd probably spend the evening with them, but we aren't. I don't want them there in the morning for presents as I see mil trying to make the whole experience her grandma experience and it seems odd to say sure come visit but you can't come over until 2pm so wait in your hotel all day.

Anyways my DH is an only child. My mil brings up the holidays every year since things changed (us moving, no longer going to their house for every holiday) and DH always says something like ""we just want it to be our family on Xmas"" which I think stung mil because she said something like she was family too.

Anyways the reason for this post is because they visited from out of town this past weekend and mil again asked DH who again said something like we were doing just us for the holidays. (Mil conveniently asked the like ten minutes I wasn't around). And again she said something like my kids were her family too, my DH thought as a means to make him feel bad. 

I don't mean to ice her out, it just isn't convenient AND I sincerely think she would make every moment a ""grandma moment"". And honestly if she had thought more about being actually loving and welcoming to me instead of faking it and being incredibly entitled when the babies started coming she wouldn't be in this situation. 

I guess I just feel bad because my DH is an only, and it seems cruel to make someone celebrate a holiday alone(ish, sans kid/grandkid). But then I think, well I deserve to enjoy the holidays as well with my kids and not suffering through jokes made at my expense or being pushed out of special moments so the grandparents get the experience they thought they'd get (literally words fil said to DH in a conversation once about us not seeing them as much as they liked).

Tidbits from mostly tame visit:

It was mils bday recently, she went on and on about having a cupcake with my son. So I bought cupcakes and brought them out after dinner. Mil kept saying my son baked them for her ( weird). They go to eat it, she's trying to get my son to some happy birthday to her, he's a toddler. She's filming, since everything is about pictures and likes. Son super uncooperative, eventually she gives up. But like I just think it's weird she wanted a video of my toddler singing her happy birthday when clearly all he wanted was to eat a cupcake. It wasn't bad, but annoying because it takes her a while to give up, past the normal ok he isn't into this.

Then mil asks DH if she can give son toys she brought. He says sure. She gets them, one is actually a toy ds would love. I'm like ""oh wow, how did you all know, ds will love this"" being genuinely sincere and complimentary. Fil ""he calls us"" sarcastic, mil quips in, ""yea he calls us didn't you know"". Ok so I compliment you all and your assholes and make fun of me about it? I just don't get them or how that was a funny response."
48,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeutic at this point in time.

TPP seems to have no idea that children are actual tiny human beings with feelings of their own. She also seems to have no idea that anyone she gave birth to can have thoughts different from her own. 

&amp;#x200B;

These were when I only had one child, but she was ""HERS"". She never referred to her as my daughter, or my anything. She was HER granddaughter. Her baby. Hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she let it be known that DD wasn't a PERSON to her, she was a toy. She sent me an email that essentially asked me to treat my child like a gallon of milk, to be set out on the porch. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Please let me be grandma. I won't speak ro you at all if you don't want me to. Let me swing her in your yard a few minutes and I will leave. I won't take pictures, I won't bother you. You can just send her out the door and I will help her on the swings. You say 2 min then ok. I'll put her on the porch and leave. Nothing said. If I mess up and talk then you don't have to do it again if you don't want. I will not speak to you. Please.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""I don't understand how you can throw me away like trash. I love you and I have begged for forgiveness. You was always my special girl. So smart and so petty and I was so proud watching you grow up. The sleepovers and dancing. Always so much fun. At least you can't take that from me. I can not see how anyone with a heart could do her mom this way. I have cherish my grandbaby. My hurt comes from the idea you would ever think i would hurt DD and you not wanting a mom but I still love you.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, in true TPP form she can't leave those emails to just themselves. Oh goodness, no. She had to write a post on the book of faces. It shocked even me, and I knew how she was. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Familys don't set boundarys only people who are trying to do bad things and hide their bad ways from their familys is who set boundarys. I gave birth to 2 kids with the expectitations that those 2 kids will be my kids for life. I didn't give birth to 2 kids to be told what i could and could not do and I refuse to do so. I have rights as a parent and rights as a grand parent and I will be damned if one of my kids try and tell me what I can and cant do. They're gonna learn; I am the mom and what i say goes. They won't be talking about boundarys anymore anytime soon.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

And there you go folks. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's how TPP feels about my boundaries and how she feels my child is a toy.. or an object?  lol."
49,"I'm new to Reddit - I've never read or posted before today, so apologies if I get terminology wrong. I was directed to this thread from a website about infidelity (the non-sexual kind). I think I just need to get this all out.

So, I guess, some background on my MIL.

When I first met her, I thought she was amazing. She was attractive, kind, outgoing, and always gave me compliments. I was living in a unit within a block of units her son (my now husband) owned, and the boundary breaking started slowly, but BIG. I came home a few times after work to my unit unlocked, or clearly having been entered. She was going in when I wasn't there - without asking - and helping herself to the privacy of my living space. I was such a people pleaser back then that I just let it go. She stood all over me, and did as she pleased.

When her son and I started dating, if she couldn't contact him she would call me - CONSTANTLY. I mean at work, in the middle of the night, repeated calls (I think the top number of repeated dials was close to thirty?), all backed up by sms with single words or short statements like 'ANSWER', 'IMPORTANT', 'WHERE S...?', 'PICK UP PHONE NOW'. And when I answered, no 'hello', no 'how are you'. Just a blunt, 'Where's my son? Get him to call me' \*Hangs up phone\*

So that was the early days. Fun times. Life was brighter.

Fast forward a few years, and here's a dot point breakdown of our greatest hits:

1. Two weeks before my wedding day goes into my room when I'm not there, finds my wedding dress, trashes it. Organises for my fiance to go out with friends, and invites me to her house that evening. I arrive to seven wedding dresses of her choosing, accompanied by some of her greatest quotes.

'You'll never marry my son wearing that dress (points to my original dress and laughs)'.

'Do you think he'd want to see you walking towards you in THAT? I doubt it. I'd walk away.'

'If you think I'd let my son marry you in that, then you won't be marrying him. You will wear one of these dresses. If these are not to your liking, I will take you to bridal stores tomorrow and select a dress for you myself.'

I gave in... but not entirely. I got a different dress. I hated my wedding day. By the time I got there, I was broken - that wasn't all down to her, my family contributed too.  At the reception, she grabbed my arm and told me to go get water for her, and for all the older relatives present. Her step-daughter stepped in and saved me. I was surprised she wasn't waiting for us in our marital bed - literally.

2. We lived in an old house for a while with a beautiful big verandah, where I would make a drink and sit on the front step. MIL decided we should have a table for that, and told me so. Cue multiple weeks of her sending me tables for sale, links to pages for second hand tables, messages saying she's at a place with a sale on and can get one RIGHT NOW SO ANSWER. I ended up, after verbally telling her no countless times, sending her a message and saying that I appreciated her thoughts, but I was happy with my home the way it was. She didn't reply.

A few weeks later, it's Christmas. My Secret Santa is so excited, saying, 'I was told you really wanted this. I'm pretty stoked I could get it. It's outside!' and you know how it ends. My Secret Santa had gotten me an outdoor table after my MIL had kindly told them a week earlier, I'd been talking about wanting one for months. My husband was totally ok with this. Said words to the effect of 'Sometimes things just get muddled in her head'. I smashed the table to pieces two months later and tossed it in the trash.

3. I was 39 weeks pregnant. MIL walked into my house, says 'Look, I know you're going to take this the wrong way, but don't, ok? Don't take it the wrong way? Because I know you WILL, but I'm not BEING offensive, so just remember that when you take it the wrong way.' To which I'm like, 'Yeah, ok, what exactly is it you want to say', and she says, 'Well I know you're not going to have that baby anytime soon, because you live in a pigsty.' \*Laughs and laughs and laughs\*. Husband smiles along with her.

4. Decides our lawn needs to be mowed. Is told repeatedly, 'Yeah we've got it sorted, it's not your concern.' I wake up one morning, heavily pregnant, to a stranger outside my window mowing our lawn, and my butt naked bod fully exposed. I called my husband, who hasn't organised it, but defends her right to do so. Fucking yay. I tell her in no short terms, to never, ever, do that again. She now tells me - EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE COMES TO THE HOUSE - 'I'm going to get you a goat to take care of this lawn!' \*Laughs and laughs and laughs\*

5. At my baby shower MIL tells my Mum 'Oh yeah, I think if it was up to (88), she wouldn't let me have a thing to do with this baby'. My Mum and another lady ignore her, so she says it louder - the exact same thing, in front of all my friends, when I've left to use the toilet. My Mum says in my defense, 'You don't say things like that about people when they can't defend themselves'. Everyone ignores my MIL.

Go my Mum. She's a rockstar.

6. MIL repeatedly calls her husband a 'f\*\*\*ing a\*\*\*hole', 'complete jerk', 'failure' in front of her other grandkids and family members (including her husband), and voices how 'he's nothing without her', and that she 'only stays with him for the kids'.

7. On countless occasions, MIL goes behind my back when I've said no to something, and asks my husband, who says yes. She then straight up lies when I call her out on it in front of him, and as always he makes excuses about her being 'confused'. She really hams that up for him. It would be adorable if it wasn't so bat sh\*t f\*\*\*ing crazy and utterly, utterly contributing to the destruction of our marriage.

8. In our hometown MIL is known as a gossip and a slanderer. She has literally walked up our main street and bitched to people about her husband, her SIL, and me. One of the people she spoke to was a client of mine, who was also a mother of a friend of mine. One day the friend comes to  me and explains how my MIL had ran into her mother on the street, and that my MIL was saying 'the worst things' about me. My friend explains that her Mum wouldn't even give her details they were so bad, and that she said to my MIL 'You need to stop this. It's not true, and it's not right. You've got to get help.' (Also yay for my friends Mum!). I tell my husband about it in tears, and he says, 'My poor Mum. It's not right that she (referring to my friends Mum) has gone and spoken to people about that.'

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, the list goes on and on. She's battling for access to her other granchildren at the moment, because her SIL despises her and wants her to have nothing to do with them. There is a whole other story there, and a sad one - my MIL lost her daughter to cancer, and the whole journey brought out the worst in her towards her SIL. They each treated the other terribly.  And at the same time, my husband became her only confidant. She had to have him, at all hours, all the time. I approached the subject with him a few times and said that I really needed him home, with me, and he told me 'Don't make me choose. You'll lose.' :(

So here's the crux of it all: in the midst of the cancer battle, my husband told me he wanted to start a trust with me for our generation and the next. We went to an accountant about it. We looked at two properties to purchase. It felt like a part of our lives was going the way it should have after our marriage, and it gave me hope.

A couple of weeks after, my MIL asks me what I think of the land she's bought. It turns out she asked him to use her money (she's loaded, and he fell for it). They started a trust together, and had purchased both the properties we'd looked at.

Guys... my heart is breaking. That happened a few years ago, and he just doesn't understand why it's wrong, and I can't put it into words in a way that he'll hear it. He says, 'it was only brief, you can't get hung up on something that was only an idea for a couple of weeks', but it's not really about that. It's about marriage, and committing yourself to another person, and I guess it's about the implicit - or explicit - promises we made to one another, regarding building a future together. I.e., him and me. Just him and me.

I can't compete with my MIL's money. We have a son. I hate my husband. I despise my MIL. Everytime the trust comes up,  my husband promises me that he is going to build a future with me, but here we are.... no trust of our own. No money left in his account, because it's all in theirs. No money in my account, because I'm a stay-at-home Mum with a 1yr old.

I'm fucked. I can't compete with this woman. She's won, and I've lost the man I love more than anyone in the world. And I have to make this choice about whether to stay and deal with this - which I can't, I just end up being resentful and hateful and treating my husband horrendously - or breaking our family apart, and trying to build my future again on my own.

The other things is... we totally could have done it together. I earned six figures before marriage and kids. I'm a driven, career woman, who loves her family and wanted to build a future with them. We totally could have made it.

My husband once said to me, 'I'm shooting for the stars with what I want to do with my life, and I want you right there beside me'. He spoke about our combined earning power. And then my MIL offered him all of her money, and he told me, 'She needs a champion. I want to champion her'.

But.... I needed him to champion me. And he still could have championed her, without giving my seat in the sidecar away.

So here we are, with a recent acknowledgment of more broken promises regarding a property we had just last week spoken about buying together (my husband and I). It would have been our first. By the end of the day we'd discussed it, he'd changed his mind. He would purchase it with my MIL.

And.... I'm out.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I just saw the dictionary at the side. This is straight up jocasta complex. I've actually spoken to my husband about how his MIL behaves towards him is the relationship she needs to be having with her husband...."
50,"I think I could use some advice, if anyone has any tips on how to approach an upcoming conversation with my family (SOs NOILs).
 

SO and I have been very low contact with my parents for the past 3-4 months after a pretty major conflict. A problem that could have been solved with communication and respect devolved due to my parents lack of open communication, unwillingness to acknowledge poor behaviour, and taking our LC as a spiteful snub instead of the self-protective action it has been. For context, SO and I have been together for 12+ years, so this is not new territory for us to tread. I guess the difference this time is that, while I’d love to get back to a place where we can all participate in family get-togethers and be civil, I really cannot just ‘go along to get along’ anymore. I think that major work needs to be done if there is any hope of moving forward with healthy, respectful relationships between the four of us.


I don’t hate my family. But it is a very mixed bag of dysfunction. 
My dad is the classic rug sweeper, enabler, with a big heart and no spine. One on one he can acknowledge my moms bad behaviour, but tends to be basically a jellyfish when she is present.
My mom is some combination of undiagnosed alcoholic/narcissist/BPD. 


Besides the major recent issue, we have a history of issues such as (but not limited to) the points noted below. It would be impossible to sum up all of the dysfunction without writing a novel that no one really has time to read.

 
-          Mom making underhanded comments to SO and then backpedaling when called out (“I didn’t mean it as an insult!”)
-          SO and I often feeling like we’re furniture – required to show up for family events, but not really treated as people who matter (very little actual depth in the overall relationships, no one listens to what we say a lot of the time if I am being honest as well as an imbalance of consideration for us vs. my siblings)
-          In this instance, as well as in past conflicts, the catalyst for my parents trying to organize a conversation was one of my siblings basically telling them “This is uncomfortable for me and my family, I want this resolved so we aren’t all so fractured.” It often feels like the reason to mend fences is to keep sibling happy, not because of concern for what we’re feeling/upset about.
 

They’ve requested that we all get together and talk, which SO and I agreed to do. Neither SO or I really have high hopes for this conversation, as my mom tends to take blame poorly and be combative. I just sort of want to give it one good, solid, HONEST, attempt so I know I did what I could.

 
I think I am feeling like there is SO MUCH ground to cover that it is almost daunting. I have a feeling that my parents feel that if we discuss the recent conflict and all apologize then we’ll all move on and return to normal. But I feel that normal needs to be really recalibrated to truly have healthy, positive relationships. And I do want that, but I am not positive that we’ll all be able to get there. I may be underestimating them, but I don’t think my parents are necessarily very introspective or evolved in terms of things like conflict resolution and healthy relationship dynamics. It’s sort of like they never really learned these skills.

 
I think it’s important to outline our intentions for this conversation (to ourselves), heading in to it, so we know what we need to come from it to even consider it a positive experience. But I am feeling overwhelmed with even trying to sort that out. 


I feel like over the years I have read so much good advice on here, that has helped me learn how to handle my family and have a back bone and healthy boundaries, so I guess I am hoping for a starting point.


Do we use this conversation to specifically address just the recent situation?
Do we delve in to the overall problems in the relationship?
Do we plan to outline boundaries/needs going forward?
Or do we simply plan to address that there is work to be done and leave that ball in their court?


It feels like there is no neat happy ending to one conversation alone. At best, if they really can hear us out and consider our perspective, I would hope for us all to build a new, strong foundation to move forward on."
51,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
52,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
53,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
54,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
55,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
56,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
57,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
58,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
59,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
60,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
61,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
62,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
63,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
64,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
65,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
66,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
67,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
68,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
69,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
70,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
71,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
72,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
73,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
74,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
75,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
76,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
77,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
78,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
79,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
80,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
81,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
82,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
83,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
84,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
85,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
86,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
87,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
88,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
89,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
90,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
91,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

93,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
94,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
95,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
96,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
97,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
98,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
99,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
100,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
101,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
102,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
103,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
104,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
105,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
106,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
107,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
108,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
109,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
110,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
111,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
112,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
113,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
114,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
115,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
116,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
117,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
119,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
120,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
121,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
122,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
123,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
124,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
125,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
126,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
127,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
128,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
129,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
130,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
131,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
132,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
133,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
134,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
135,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
136,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
137,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
138,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
139,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
140,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
141,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
142,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
143,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
144,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
145,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
146,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
147,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
148,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
149,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
150,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
151,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
152,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
153,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
154,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
155,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
156,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
157,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
158,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
159,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
160,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
161,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
162,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
163,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
164,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
165,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
166,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
167,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
168,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
169,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

171,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
172,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
173,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
174,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
175,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
176,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
177,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
178,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
179,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
180,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
181,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
182,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
183,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
184,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
185,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
186,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
187,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
188,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
189,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
190,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
191,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
192,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
193,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
194,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
195,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
196,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
197,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
198,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
199,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
200,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
201,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
202,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
203,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
204,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
205,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
206,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
207,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
208,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
209,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
210,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
211,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
212,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
213,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
214,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
215,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
216,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
217,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
218,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
219,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
220,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
221,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
222,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
223,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
224,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
225,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
226,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
227,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
228,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
229,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
230,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
231,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
232,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
233,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
234,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
235,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
236,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
237,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
238,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
239,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
240,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
241,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
242,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
243,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
244,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
245,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
246,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
247,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

249,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
250,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
251,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
252,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
253,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
254,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
255,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
256,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
257,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
258,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
259,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
260,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
261,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
262,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
263,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
264,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
265,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
266,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
267,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
268,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
269,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
270,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
271,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
272,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
273,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
274,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
275,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
276,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
277,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
278,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
279,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
280,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
281,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
282,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
283,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
284,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
285,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
286,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
287,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
288,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
289,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
290,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
291,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
292,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
293,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
294,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
295,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
296,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
297,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
298,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
299,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
301,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
302,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
303,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
304,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
305,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
306,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
307,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
308,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
309,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
310,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
311,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
312,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
313,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
314,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
315,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
316,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
317,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
318,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
319,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
320,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
321,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
322,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
323,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
324,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
325,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

327,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
328,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
329,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
330,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
331,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
332,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
333,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
334,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
335,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
336,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
337,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
338,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
339,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
340,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
341,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
342,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
343,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
344,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
345,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
346,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
347,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
348,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
349,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
350,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
351,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
352,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
353,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
354,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
355,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
356,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
357,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
358,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
359,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
360,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
361,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
362,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
363,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
364,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
365,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
366,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
367,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
368,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
369,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
370,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
371,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
372,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
373,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
374,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
375,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
376,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
377,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
378,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
379,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
380,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
381,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
382,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
383,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
384,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
385,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
386,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
387,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
388,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
389,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
390,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
391,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
392,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
393,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
394,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
395,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
396,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
397,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
398,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
399,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
400,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
401,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
402,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
403,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

405,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
406,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
407,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
408,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
409,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
410,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
411,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
412,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
413,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
414,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
415,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
416,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
417,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
418,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
419,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
420,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
421,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
422,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
423,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
424,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
425,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
426,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
427,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
428,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
429,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
430,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
431,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
432,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
433,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
434,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
435,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
436,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
437,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
438,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
439,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
440,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
441,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
442,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
443,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
444,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
445,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
446,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
447,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
448,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
449,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
450,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
451,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
452,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
453,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
454,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
455,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
456,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
457,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
458,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
459,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
460,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
461,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
462,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
463,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
464,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
465,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
466,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
467,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
468,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
469,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
470,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
471,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
472,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
473,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
474,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
475,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
476,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
477,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
478,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
479,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
480,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
481,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

483,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
484,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
485,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
486,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
487,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
488,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
489,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
490,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
491,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
492,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
493,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
494,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
495,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
496,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
497,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
498,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
499,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
500,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
501,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
502,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
503,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
504,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
505,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
506,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
507,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
508,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
509,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
510,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
511,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
512,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
513,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
514,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
515,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
516,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
517,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
518,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
519,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
520,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
521,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
522,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
523,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
524,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
525,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
526,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
527,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
528,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
529,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
530,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
531,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
532,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
533,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
534,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
535,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
536,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
537,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
538,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
539,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
540,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
541,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
542,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
543,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
544,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
545,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
546,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
547,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
548,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
549,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
550,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
551,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
552,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
553,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
554,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
555,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
556,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
557,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
558,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
559,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

561,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
562,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
563,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
564,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
565,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
566,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
567,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
568,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
569,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
570,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
571,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
572,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
573,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
574,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
575,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
576,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
577,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
578,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
579,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
580,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
581,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
582,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
583,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
584,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
585,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
586,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
587,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
588,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
589,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
590,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
591,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
592,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
593,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
594,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
595,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
596,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
597,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
598,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
599,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
600,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
601,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
602,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
603,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
604,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
605,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
606,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
607,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
608,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
609,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
610,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
611,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
612,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
613,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
614,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
615,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
616,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
617,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
618,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
619,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
620,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
621,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
622,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
623,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
624,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
625,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
626,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
627,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
628,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
629,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
630,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
631,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
632,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
633,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
634,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
635,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
636,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
637,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

639,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
640,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
641,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
642,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
643,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
644,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
645,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
646,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
647,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
648,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
649,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
650,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
651,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
652,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
653,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
654,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
655,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
656,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
657,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
658,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
659,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
660,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
661,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
662,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
663,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
664,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
665,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
666,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
667,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
668,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
669,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
670,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
671,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
672,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
673,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
674,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
675,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
676,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
677,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
678,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
679,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
680,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
681,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
682,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
683,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
684,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
685,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
686,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
687,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
688,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
689,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
690,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
691,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
692,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
693,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
694,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
695,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
696,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
697,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
698,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
699,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
700,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
701,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
702,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
703,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
704,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
705,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
706,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
707,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
708,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
709,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
710,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
711,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
712,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
713,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
714,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
715,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

717,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
718,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
719,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
720,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
721,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
722,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
723,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
724,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
725,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
726,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
727,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
728,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
729,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
730,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
731,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
732,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
733,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
734,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
735,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
736,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
737,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
738,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
739,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
740,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
741,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
742,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
743,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
744,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
745,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
746,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
747,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
748,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
749,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
750,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
751,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
752,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
753,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
754,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
755,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
756,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
757,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
758,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
759,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
760,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
761,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
762,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
763,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
764,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
765,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
766,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
767,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
768,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
769,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
770,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
771,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
772,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
773,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
774,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
775,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
776,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
777,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
778,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
779,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
780,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
781,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
782,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
783,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
784,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
785,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
786,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
787,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
788,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
789,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
790,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
791,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
792,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
793,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

795,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
796,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
797,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
798,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
799,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
800,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
801,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
802,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
803,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
804,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
805,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
806,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
807,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
808,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
809,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
810,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
811,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
812,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
813,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
814,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
815,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
816,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
817,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
818,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
819,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
820,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
821,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
822,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
823,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
824,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
825,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
826,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
827,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
828,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
829,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
830,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
831,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
832,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
833,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
834,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
835,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
836,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
837,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
838,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
839,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
840,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
841,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
842,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
843,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
844,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
845,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
846,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
847,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
848,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
849,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
850,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
851,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
852,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
853,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
854,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
855,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
856,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
857,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
858,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
859,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
860,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
861,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
862,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
863,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
864,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
865,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
866,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
867,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
868,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
869,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
870,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
871,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

873,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
874,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
875,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
876,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
877,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
878,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
879,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
880,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
881,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
882,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
883,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
884,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
885,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
886,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
887,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
888,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
889,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
890,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
891,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
892,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
893,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
894,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
895,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
896,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
897,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
898,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
899,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
900,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
901,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
902,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
903,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
904,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
905,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
906,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
907,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
908,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
909,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
910,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
911,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
912,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
913,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
914,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
915,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
916,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
917,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
918,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
919,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
920,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
921,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
922,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
923,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
924,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
925,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
926,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
927,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
928,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
929,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
930,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
931,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
932,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
933,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
934,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
935,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
936,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
937,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
938,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
939,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
940,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
941,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
942,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
943,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
944,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
945,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
946,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
947,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
948,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
949,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

951,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
952,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
953,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
954,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
955,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
956,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
957,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
958,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
959,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
960,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
961,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
962,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
963,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
964,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
965,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
966,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
967,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
968,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
969,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
970,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
971,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
972,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
973,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
974,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
975,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
976,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
977,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
978,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
979,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
980,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
981,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
982,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
983,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
984,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
985,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
986,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
987,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
988,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
989,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
990,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
991,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
992,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
993,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
994,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
995,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
996,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
997,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
998,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
999,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
1000,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
1001,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."
1002,"[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dicwju/mil_has_it_all_under_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
1003,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
1004,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
1005,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
1006,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
1007,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
1008,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
1009,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
1010,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
1011,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
1012,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
1013,"Does your MIL suck, but you don't feel like making an entire post about it? Is she a BEC and you just want to vent about the crumbs in your carpet for a moment? Post here!"
1014,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
1015,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."
1016,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
1017,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"
1018,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
1019,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
1020,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
1021,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
1022,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
1023,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
1024,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."
1025,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
1026,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
1027,"My stepmum has been in my life for 21 years. I barely remember a time she wasn't around. She's always welcomed me into her family and loved me, and I want to recognise that by involving her in getting ready before the wedding. I was supposed to be a flower girl in their wedding when I was 6 and in the end I wasn't allowed to go.

I invited mum to get ready with us, and she initially said no, she would get ready elsewhere. Fine by me, but I asked her a few days later if she wanted my makeup artist to do her hair and makeup, at which point she asked who was getting ready with me, then flipped when I told her my stepmum might be there. She says my stepmum is ""taking her role"" and I don't need mum there because I have her ""even though she has her own daughter"".

I responded saying that my stepmums existence doesn't threaten mum's role as my mum, it just means I'm lucky enough to have more people in my life who are important to me. 

She ended the conversation (a week ago) by saying she just won't come and my stepmum can be MOB, to which I haven't responded, and I haven't heard from her since. She did comment on one of her own Facebook posts (which was looking for outfit recommendations) saying that she didn't need it anymore 🤷

At this point, I don't really know how to proceed. I know it's a bluff to manipulate me into excluding my stepmum, but that's not happening. I have to give final numbers to the caterer a few days before the wedding and I don't know if she will contact me before then, in which case the last thing I heard was that she isn't coming and if I'm to take that literally...."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her friend Karen (fake name). Quick word about Karen, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning Karen tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and Karen rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear Karen asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, Karen and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come.

1029,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
1030,"Edit: okay, so after reading the responses I will not make him go shopping for MIL. I am still hitting the shop because I wanted to for me, but I won't mention MIL. You guys are right. I still fight my own FOG with her and you guys have been great for snapping me out of it. And I love the idea of buying for others. A number of places do Christmas Tree Angels for kids at local shelters and I believe I will do that this year. 

*on mobile*

Small little thing but it's really showing DH's FOG level. 

So we are on vacation and with Christmas coming up, I am always on the lookout for gifts/ideas. Due to DH being NC with his siblings, he has already stated on more than one occasion that it is plain money for them, no thought into gifts or nothing. Well I of course assumed that MIL was exempt from this cause of him being her baaaaabbbby. Nope. Even though DH is now VLC with them, he still does not plan to jump back in that muck. Several times we have done things and I've been like ""Should we get ""blah"" for MIL?""....""Nope"". Now I am making him go shopping in one particular place just because I know she would love something from there, but where as before I would of pushed him to a $50 or higher item, I am fine with just picking up a little stocking stuffer.

So while I am disappointed I don't get to go Christmas shopping for everyone like I love to do, I am happy DH is at a level of not bending over backwards to make everyone happy.

And for those that are going to question why MIL will get anything at all: I am playing this game for the long run and don't want a single time when MIL can throw it at DH or myself of we weren't thinking of her. And it's not a horrible, out of the way shop either."
1031,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
1032,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
1033,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
1034,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
1035,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
1036,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
1037,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
1038,"I am transgender, female to male, I've been out of the proverbial closet for the last year or so. I haven't had a proper conversation with my mother about what's going on, because I just can't talk to her, but it's pretty obvious I have changed drastically in the last year. 

I now look like the man I've always been inside, and I am damn happy. I do what I want, quit the terrible job she made me get, and enrolled myself back into uni to have the dream career I have always wanted. 

 But my mother can't let go. I moved out about 3 years ago to escape her, she treats me like her little mini me, and is terrified that I might be a lesbian (surprise! I am gay, which means I like men! Suck on that mum!). I am 25, independent, and finally happy. 

Last night however, she came back from a work trip and told me she had gifts for me. Like a sucker, I went to see what she had for me. 

Makeup, lots of makeup, women's clothes, and a nice pair of tennis shoes. I was like... Okay, I will donate the makeup and women's clothes, but the shoes are great. Well, turns out the shoes aren't gifts, it's a bribe. I can only have them if I make a promise to be a ""gorgeous, féminine woman"" like she knows I am inside, and how I should fight my depression, and she knows I'm depressed because I look so hideous, that I should grow my hair out because I would look skinnier, and how much better I'd be with boobs (I bind). She then put her hands on my chest to see where my boobs had gone, in front of family and strangers, and seemed shocked when a 25 years old adult pushed her away. 

She then spent the remaining of the evening telling me how ugly I am, how much prettier I was when I was trying to kid myself and the world that I was a woman. When I was miserable enough to attempt suicide 4 times. But she knows none of this because she doesn't deserve to know anything about me. She has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. Ive been made to feel like a burden, and like a dress up toy my whole life. I am done. 

I cried myself to sleep that night and considered suicide again. But today I am angry, so damn angry. And now even angrier because I just got a call from a family friend. Apparently my mum called her to tell her that I am lazy, afraid of work (I am unemployed currently, but looking for retail work to go back to uni, I don't ask for money, I'm living off my savings.) and that this friend needs to convince me to return back to real estate (my previous career I left because it's a horrendous industry, no offence meant to the realtors out there). So now family friends think I'm being lazy and scared to work (wtf does this mean??) when on reality I'm putting myself through uni, paying rent and food for myself and my baby brother who lives with me because our mother is batshit protective with him, and am taking care of myself. 

Now I'm a pushover, conditioned to jump when mother dearest says jump. But I've had enough. I'm an adult. I am a fucking grown man with dreams and the right to achieve them however the fuck I want. Yet when I should be saying that to her, the words die in my chest and I feel like choking. I just stop talking. 

I wish I could go NC, but our dog lives there and I love my fluffy baby like nothing else. I'm just done though. Life is hard enough without her added dose of bullshit."
