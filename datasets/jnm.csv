1,A thread that is our own kind of /r/awww or /r/eyebleach. Brag all you want!
2,"I had an antenatal appointment yesterday as I'm 30 weeks. Instead of asking something normal like how her grandchild is doing, my MIL asked me if they weighed me. Why? It's clearly such a pointed question. Like (a) no, they didn't and never have, so I guess they are happy with my weight gain, and (b) even if they did and were very concerned, how is that any of her business? If I had gained a ridiculous amount and was compromising my own and my baby's health, that's between me, the medical personnel and maybe my husband.

I've gained around 10kg/22lbs, which tbh I think is fine. It's also no one's business. My pre-pregnancy weight was around 75kg/165lbs and I'm 5ft 8.5', so I'm tall and on the very top of the healthy BMI scale. I'm also fit (competed in a sport at a national team level), quite muscular with curves. I think this must horrify my 5ft 3' 50kg MIL or something because I am not particularly concerned about my weight. I'm still doing x fit 3 times a week and I've had a really easy pregnancy so far. My baby is measuring the exact size it should. As far as I can tell my arms and legs etc. haven't gained weight, I just have a good bump. But I'm annoyed that I'm even assessing this shit right now.

I don't know if she's trying to make me feel bad that I've gained weight and seem unconcerned or what. She's a snake too, because she asked me when my husband wasn't there. I just curtly answered that no, they have never weighed me or asked me my weight gain, so it obviously isn't a concern, then I walked away.

Joke is on her, because her golden boy fucking loves my body both pre-pregnancy and now. It took all the restraint I had to not ask her if she gets weighed at her doctor's appointments, because I hear it is easy to lorry the weight on after menopause."
3,"First off, thank you to everyone who has been messaging me to check up on us. I wasn’t sure if I’d do an update but I’ve had so many people who have shown genuine concern about our wellbeing I didn’t want to further worry people by never updating. This is going to be really long but I’ll try to keep this update bare bones. However, trigger warning of pet death and missing child.

Days after I posted last our sweet dog passed away. It was really hard since we’d had him for nearly 14 years but we thought he’d just died of old age since his prior vet visit he was given a bill of good health for his age. However, two days later we got another card in the mail. A condolence card for pets and I just knew. I immediately threw up and my husband and I cried for hours over how evil his mother was and the extreme guilt we felt for not protecting our dog better. We spoke with his vet and he said he’d see if he could determine cause of death. So my husband had to dig up our freshly buried pet and take him in. While we were waiting for results we switched to a new, more aggressive, attorney.

A few days after our dog’s passing our daughter went down the street in our neighborhood for a play date and I got a phone call from my neighbor. She said her little girl just came inside and told her that a car pulled up to them when they were riding their scooters in the driveway and an old lady had our daughter get in with her. Our daughter called her Grandma. Thank God my husband was home and while I was on the phone with the police he was calling his mom. She never answered but the police found our daughter at his parent’s house. Apparently his parents both acted confused as why police were there and our daughter was hysterical by the time we got her back but she was/is safe. 

His mother was arrested and his father called my husband soon after to ask him to drop the charges because “she’s your mom and she just wanted to spend time with our grandchild” and “it’s ripping our family apart having you two be so hate filled”. My husband hung up on him and she was released on bail a few days later. We’ve got the first hearing coming up to start the process of, hopefully, sending her to prison. 

We also got the test results and our vet said it was a type of rodent poison. Don’t look it up, I wish I hadn’t. Also, please don’t lecture me about not having the backyard cameras installed. The guilt of not having them installed at the same time as the front cameras is already overwhelming. Our attorney is working to see if/how our dog’s death can be included in the cases against her. 

Ending on a slightly positive note...we’ve all begun therapy. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful it’s been, individually, as a couple and as a family. If you’re reading this and having conflict with a family member please consider working through it with a professional. I 100% believe that our marriage wouldn’t have survived this and that we’d all have lasting PTSD if we hadn’t gotten in when we did. It truly saved us. 

We’re temporarily living with my parents while we make a decision on whether to stay in our house or put it up for sale. I’m devastated at the thought of leaving our house that we worked so hard for but now it holds so many negative emotions and thoughts I honestly don’t think we could continue living there.  I can’t thank the people on here enough for all the kindness and support I’ve received. This entire situation has been so isolating and it gave me tremendous comfort talking with others who have dealt with similar things. 

We still don’t know what the trigger was for her extreme behavior this past year, maybe it’s as simple as us finally standing up to her and saying no about the job for FIL. I think that’s one of the hardest parts of this...just having no concrete idea about what caused this. We’re hoping that this doesn’t drag on until she’s found guilty so we can just move forward. And as nicely as I can say, I hope I never have another reason to post on here again except to say she’ll spend years in prison. Thank you all again for your kindness!"
4,"That's what my JNMIL told me the last time we spoke to them, two months ago. They're visiting today to apologize and see our 5mo LO.

No, lady. Of course he won't treat me that way. Because I'm not screaming at him, calling him a piece of shit, because he asked you not to put the baby in an unsafe bassinet. I'm not having a full-blown tantrum because we're not leaving our baby with you to go on a long weekend vacation 5 hours away, like you proposed. Do they really think that behavior will make us more likely to leave our only child with them?

Send me strength because I will need it. Also a titanium spine. I'll have to write out everything that happened with them at some point."
5,"So after her ditching my calls and not answering me about wedding dress shopping (march) I just went without her in May.  I sent out the invites in June in case out of towners needed plenty of notice. The RSVP date was October 1st. I never got an rsvp back nor has she even tried contacting me since I asked about shopping.

I sent her a text today. 

""Hey Mom. Since we haven't heard from you and the rsvp date has passed, we won't be able to accommodate you at the wedding. 
Also, I will not be reaching out to you anymore. If you would like to talk to me (or us), you need to reach out.""

I asked my sister to ask her to leave if she shows up. She was fine with doing that. Our wedding is November 1st. Wish us luck."
6,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. We have been unsuccessful in receiving a restraining order. 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP is rather outspoken about money, whether it is hers or yours, she doesn't care. She needs to control it at all times. My parents divorced when I was 9 and my brother 7. My dad paid $600 a month in child support, $500 in alimony, paid her car note, paid our private school tuition, sent $50 a week for lunches and snacks, paid for every dime of our extracurriculars including the uniforms and practice clothes, if we got a toy or a book or whatever, my dad and my aunt bought it. Period. I cannot recall TPP ever even buying me a pack of pads without telling me to either ask my dad for money or immediately calling him and saying he needed to send $$$ immediately. TPP wasn't hurting for money, since she was getting over $1k in support plus her car note and never had to pay a dime for her kids to have anything. But, you wouldn't dare ask for $2 for a Gatorade after school for your sport because it was a waste of money and she was BROKE (she wouldn't be broke if she didn't use her child support to pay her boyfriend's child support for HIS kids). 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, TPP still didn't approve of money being spent on us kids unless she approved it. Underwear was only to be bought 1 time a year, before school started, and if she caught wind of you buying any (usually when with my dad/aunt) she'd immediately throw them out. Even if it was the approved by her time to buy underwear, if you got black panties or a black bra (black panties are the shit. I have PCOS and endometriosis, so they're magical), they were getting thrown out because black was ""too sexy"". Um, okay? Even as an adult, she'd throw a fit when she'd come over and I was folding clothes, because I have too many pairs of panties and it's NOT RIGHT, let's throw away these and these. 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP also didn't approve of Pajamas. She hated them. TPP approved sleepwear was a t-shirt and underwear. Pajamas were a Waste of Money (yes, the caps ARE necessary). Why did you need clothes you could only sleep in? Who was going to see you when you sleep? (Because clothes weren't comforting for her, they were about who could see them, period.) If I dared bring home a pair of pajamas after visiting my aunt and dad, they'd go straight to the garbage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also constantly told I have NO TASTE in clothes, that I was going to be ""picked on"" and I shouldn't be wearing this or that because I was too fat, but she'd never tell me what SHE wanted me to buy, nor would she go school shopping with me, because then what would she have to bitch about? 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see. I wasn't allowed stuffed animals ever, and if I did get one in the trash it went, because they ""gave her allergies and upset my brother's asthma"". Throw blankets weren't allowed, because if you wanted to be covered up you should go to bed. More than 2 pillows was a no no and the extras were getting thrown away because ""that's stupid!"" Body washes were a no no, because they can cause your eggs to die from an infection? But girls didn't use irish spring bars like she bought for my brother, so i was supposed to just use only water on everything. Never taught me about deodorant until one day my cousin, who I looked up to, was like, I think it's time for you to switch Deodorants, girl, and my mother announced ""she's nasty and doesn't even wear any!"" I was 12. No white colored ANYTHING because she didn't believe in bleach and white got ""nasty"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Nicer shampoos and conditioners? (Which back then we're talking pantene, not anything spectacular.) Nope, and if I brought them home she'd throw them in the garbage as a waste of money. She only bought the .88 cent Suave stuff and that's what we were allowed to have. Tshirts from sports/dance/school fundraising? nope, you don't need that, it's a waste! Tshirts make you look huge! 

&amp;#x200B;

Breakfast wasn't a thing. Breakfast was a meal made up by food companies to make you spend money. You really only need one good meal a day. Her suppers, every single night, were hamburger helper, which I don't eat because of a texture issue, or she'd dump a bag of fries on a tray and a pack of hamburger patties on a tray, cover it in worchestershire sauce, and stick it all in the oven. She was a horrible cook and couldn't make much and definitely wasn't about to start trying. It would be world war 3 if TPP found out we'd ate breakfast, EVEN if we weren't had her house. 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP didn't brush our teeth or buy us tooth brushes. Never taught us any of that, until it was time to go to the dentist for the first time when I was 8, and she told the dentist she told us to brush but we refused. Then as we got older, she enjoyed screaming at us that we were ""nasty"" if we had cavities and stuff, and would only let us use the free toothbrushes after that-if we bought other ones or a different toothpaste, trashed. Immediately. 

 

Her quirks (and I'm sure there is more) have definitely influenced me today. I buy panties often, and I LOVE black undies. I currently own a few dozen pairs of pajamas, because I like pajamas. I use expensive ish shampoo that would make her scream. I own several different flavors of body washes. My kids have stuffed animals out the whazoo. I have six pillows on my side of the best and a blanket ladder in my living room full of throws. (and many, many other things she'd disapprove of! I'm sure you've read we've decided to forgo college funds for the kids in order to buy my expensive TP, no?)

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, she'd have a coronary on how I am doing things and would probably say i was doing it to be disrespectful. What a lovely thing it is that she's cut off."
7,"First, holy shit, we hit a million people- da fuq. Many of you newbies might not know the saga of Fucking Linda. Just know that Fucking Linda is it's own, special trigger warning. There's nothing else that can really be said. 

So I've told this story to a bunch of people in person for the last month, which means it's hitting me hard and I need to get it out of my head.

I was in a bad car accident a few years ago. I was at a red light, guy hit me going in the neighborhood of 80 miles an hour, I've had lots of complications from it since. I broke every bone in my neck and dislocated everything except my inner ears and my left foot, and since I already had a chronic pain conidition it's been a barrel of monkeys full of fun.

When I was getting x-rays to see if I'd broken ribs or just dislocated them from the seat belt (it was just a dislocation) the doctor asked me about the bad car accident I'd been in as a kid. 

Record scratch, check that, say what, partner? I hadn't been in a car accident as a child. He said it would have been around 11-12 years old, was I sure? Yeah, pretty damn sure I'd remember being in a bad car accident at 11-12 years old.

Turns out there's a network of (not sure the word- I was still dealing with a lot of head trauma issues) bone scars over my growth plates which put the damage at 11-12 years of age. The doctor said it looked like I'd been thrown out of the back of a pickup truck at speed or something similarly bad. I was shocked.

11-12 is when Fucking Linda's physical abuse of me stepped up. It was another penny drop moment. I thought that I didn't go to a doctor all that often (severe medical neglect, I was coughing up blood for 6 months at one point) because we were just too poor... but my GC brother never went through this kind of neglect. I wonder if she knew she was beating me enough to damage my bones. I wonder if she just mixed some medical neglect to create some plausible deniability for the physical abuse. 

She still has no idea WHYYYYY OH WHYYYYY HOW COULD I DOOOOOO THIS TO HER NO ONE DESERVES THIS I am NC. And is telling people the extent of her abuse was pulling my hair once when I was 14. I offered the FM access to my x-rays if they wanted to verify, they blanched and declined. 

Important note, guys- my Mom is **great** with kids under 5. But **abusers are abusers**. Without a huge amount of hard, difficult, painful personal growth with a trained professional, that leopard isn't going to change it's spots. If they abused you or your spouse, it does not matter how good they are with kids or how good of a grandma you are- eventually the kid will learn to say no or develop their own spine or hit whatever developmental stage flips the switch in their head, and Grandma is going to abuse them the way they abused you or your SO.

Seriously, it's fucked up that the scars she left are literally bone deep.

Fucking Linda."
8,"Following MIL manhandling my nipples, coming uninvited to hospital, bringing uninvited guests and criticising me for 3 hours after my emergency csection and severe prenatal depression, things were a little tense.

Finally got the all clear to go home and it took us about 4 hours to register the birth, get discharged and do all the paperwork by which time its 6pm. I just want to go home, snuggle with baby and introduce her to my stepson. I'm suddenly a mother, have a whole new family and just want to nest. So we did just that.

The next day she FLIPS out when she finds out I'm home because apparently my niece (the youngest family member) must carry the baby into the home as per tradition. No one told me this and i wouldn't have agreed as i just wanted to hibernate. She complained that now I'm in her country i have to do things her way.

DH tells her she can come visit the next day but after 12 because i had an important presentation for work. I'm a journalist and media freedom advocate and had to give a presentation to an international delegation of media freedom orgs. I strapped my daughter in a sling and went and did it. Halfway through the presentation my phone starts vibrating incessantly. MIL is calling and i keep hanging up but she calls back. Turns out she is outside our apartment (DH is asleep and didn't hear the door) and she's demanding to go in. She finally spoke to DH who explained she must stick to times we say for visits and she stormed off in a huge huff.

Next time we met, a few days later she asked if i was BF DD. i was struggling after severe depression, a traumatic pregnancy and birth, and the huge pressure i felt from her after her demands and criticisms. At the time i was BF, supplementing and pumping. I mentioned the work pump and she went off, saying how bad it was. I sat there with tears in my eyes whilst DH put her back in her box. For days all i could hear was her criticisms and disapproval and i struggled more and more until one morning there was no milk. I tried for 2 more weeks and even tried to relactate recently but no luck. I genuinely feel she traumatized me with her nipple grabbing (previous post) and critcisms.

We met a few times after that, each time she wpykd criticize how baby was dressed, how I was caring for her, her temperature, how often i bathed her, me babywearing exclusively, and she would kiss her even when i asked her not to for health reasons. She took her out of my arms on two occasions and started referring to her as ""my baby"". Despite all this, i played the good DIL and sent photos every day. 

Not once did she ask me how i was. Half the time she didnt reply, and when she did it was to say how lovely ""her baby"" was.

Tbc"
9,"Every year I go to my Dad's house for Thanksgiving, and every year QoE makes it a miserable experience for me. I am often stuffed into the worst chair, in a corner, away from anyone I might want to chat with. If I speak at all, she loudly talks over me or belittles me in front of the whole family. After dinner she announces that she cooked and that she is sending me to the kitchen to do the dishes.

Over the years people have gotten sick of it. Some of them have decided to join me in the cleaning up (Which her kitchen is disgusting and never gets a proper clean until her sister and I do it at a holiday). Most have decided to stop going altogether.

Now, DH has refused to go for years and since his family moved across the state he has spent the last few Thanksgivings all alone. Last year he took the day to repair the bathtub. We just found out that his parents also don't get a Thanksgiving. SO this year, I am going to host his parents and at least one of our children (The other one has a baby due at that time so will probably opt to stay home) for the holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes the real problem. I have to tell QoE that I am not coming to see my father for Thanksgiving this year. She is going to be a real shit about it. ""DH is taking you away from your father! He is separating you from your family! Don't you care about your Dad? You could at least come by for dessert! Why don't you invite your Dad? It's rude to leave him out""

I am dreading telling them, but I am looking forward to a peaceful holiday with people who treat me well and make me a part of the festivities, not a house elf to serve them."
10,"I kid you not.

I had a horrible pregnancy- hemorrhaging from 12 weeks, preeclampsia, and severe pre natal depression. I spent most of my pregnancy on bed rest, medication and crying. I ended up having an emergency csection at 37.5 weeks due to my deteriorating physical and mental health, it was all very traumatic and 5 months pp i am still not ok.

Four hours after my DD was born, i was doing skin to skin. I was exhausted, in pain, and overwhelmed. She arrived at the hospital and tried to take DD off me four times, telling me i would spoil her by holding her too much. Then as i tried to breastfeed she marched over, taking full advantage of my drugged up state, got my nipple between her fingers and started rammimg it in my daughter's mouth. I was shocked and froze, she kept squeezing them and forcing it into her mouth.

The next day she came to the hospital, uninvited and unannounced when i was there alone (DH at work). She handed me a box of chocolates and said they were for me to give to guests. She criticised the room for being too hot then too cold,  the way my DD was dressed and positioned, the fact i wanted to shower,  me holding DD, me supplementing with formula, and everything. She didnt leave for 3 hours even when i said i wanted to shower and sleep. Then finally she announced her departure and said she would be bringing a little girl she babysits for, to visit tomorrow. I said no, my partner rang her and said no, we thought that would be the end of it.

I was then awake all night trying to BF and get DD to sleep. Finally at around 10am the next day, we both slept- still in hospital at this point. I was loudly woken by the door opening and a child i didnt know shouting and throwing 7 balloons at me and the bassinet. I was shocked and DD started crying. It was MIL and the child we asked her not to bring. They rushed to grab DD and i said no, at which point MIL got angry and left. She rang DH shouting and saying i was ""not hospitable"".

Had i not been in pain, traumatized, exhausted and vulnerable i would have handled it very differently but it was hard to react at the time."
11,"Deleted all of my older posts in an anxiety attack wave of fearing someone may identify me (the joys of being around toxic people aka MIL and how it affects mental health). MIL is a HUGE social media attention seeker and posts all the time about whatever possible anniversary or even when there is no reason to post. Like yesterday she posted a massively huge post on BIL's wall (on the book of faces) and since she's basically the only one posting on her son's walls most of the time, including SO's wall, since none of the brothers are big into social media, this translates into ""Mommy's Wall"". At least that what she seems to think.

So what is it about toxic MIL's and being overly involved in anniversaries between their children and children's spouses?

Big ass long message about the history of their marriage (they haven't been married that long). The couple themselves didn't post anything about THEIR own anniversary. MIL could have texted them or called if she genuinely wants to congratulate. It's like she needs to make this about her and let the world know she has something to do with it when she doesn't. It's BIL's and SIL's marriage and special day. 
And then the wall of text going with it, like as if it's a wedding speech, not some random low number. If this was a 25 year anniversary and advertised etc. .... fair enough. She does it every year and for any occasion she can think of. 
Now she has gotten it in her mind that she wants to go to the same romantic spots SO and I went this summer on a romantic getaway. With him. It's not set in stone and to be fair for once she mentioned her second husband at least might go on that trip as well, which is a first as she usually just says ""I want to do this with SO....I wanted to go there with SO..."" which gives me mega Jocasta vibes. (MIL is married, after all, but you wouldn't know since the husband is passive, she complains to SO she doesn't get laid by husband anymore - ewwww gross --- and she has a history of becoming enmeshed with SO's relationships, including a previous marriage and now us.)
Of course I can ignore her posts on social media and not get all worked up about it. Easier said than done. The woman is so damn weird it gets right under my skin. I am cordial and respectful to her face, but that's about all I can muster up to do.
I honestly feel she can't stand not being able to insert herself into relationships of her kids. She needs to make it about herself somehow. The other BIL (they all struggled with careers, growing up, and mental health and I believe her covert narc behavior has to do with it) went back to get an education for the first time in his 30's, and when he graduated he featured his girlfriend in a nice long post on social media. MIL jumped RIGHT in and had to comment on how ""she was such a beautiful and amazing person inside and out"" and not until she had written ""I am a proud mother."" 
The post wasn't about her. It was about his college graduation accomplishment and him featuring his girlfriend's support in all that this journey entailed.
Every time anyone posts about date night she is on it. Can't just leave one post be.  When I visited she tried to tell me several times she thinks SO ""touches me too much"" and ""she was worried about that and how it makes me feel"" (ewww, gross) and then even emailed me after we had left just to reiterate her point SO ""touches me too much."" We're in our late 30's. 
None of her darn business.
So yeah...not much has changed since I first posted on this forum back in February for the first time....luckily, most days though I forget she exists unless she emails me something enmeshy like she did last week. She also claims she doesn't get my emails at times. Funnily enough she's the only person literally on the planet that I email who doesn't get them. (lies) Of course that allows her to reach out more often since she's missing a response, according to her.
My reply will take two weeks and then she will get a greyrock flyer. ""Weather is nice, fall is awesome. Pumpkin, pumpkin, oh look, more pumpkins. The color orange is nice.""
The real work is no longer with MIL anyways...I better be cross-posting on JustNoSO for the most part as nothing will change MIL. It's down to SO and I to be a team and change. I have given up on the crazy Jocasta in-law.
The other day I thought back to the mother of my highschool sweetheart....who was amazing. I pictured her taking my side in a feud with now-MIL and say to me: 
What a bitch! (now-MIL).....That mental image helps. I wish I had known all those years toxic MIL's are a thing. I would have appreciated my ex-MIL's way more than I already did at the time.

Thanks for letting me rant. This space here has been a lifeline this year after realizing MIL is unhinged."
12,"At 22 years old, I got pregnant with my first child with my SO. We were thrilled with the news and happier still when we found out we were having a boy (my family has all girls). My MIL was not happy, all she whined about was how this baby was going to affect my SO's daughter, how irresponsible we were for getting pregnant when my SO wasn't working yet. 

During my baby shower she cornered everyone and anyone to complain about how could I do this to my SO's daughter? How my SO's daughter comes from a bad home (with his ex) and I should have put my SO's daughter's needs first. (MIL expected me to never have kids of my own) 

She harped about it to my great aunt M (93 years old), who bluntly told my MIL to Shut the f up (my great aunt never swore and was the sweetest old lady you've ever met. We were shocked)

My SO didn't tell his ex about our pregnancy, because he was afraid his ex or his ex's friends/family would attack me (his ex has a long history of attacking my SO's past girlfriends and being arrested). (Red flag)

The story continues....."
13,"I’ve been noticing a trend amongst our newer community members at JNMIL. They all wanted, in the beginning, for their FMIL to love them. They all try to be good hostesses, guests, family members and *FRIENDS*. While I understand that by even posting on this site, I am targeting a select demographic that is decidedly not *friends* with their MIL- I would like to share a story and some wisdom when I was a fresh, young naïve little fiancé. Maybe you can spot the warning signs earlier than I did. But then again, you are also on JUSTNO.

 

In the beginning, when things were still sexy and no one farted in bed, SO (now DH) invited me to collegetown to stay with his brother in their rental house and go to a college football game. Being the good southerner I am, and seeing as SO also went to an SEC football school, I accepted. I pulled together my skimpiest game day shirt and tightest pair of blue jeans along with a generous supply of lip gloss and jumped in the truck for a fun weekend of collegetown shenanigans with SO, his brother and the brother’s girlfriend. Fun right? 

 

Turns out, the future ILs also decided to come to collegetown that weekend on a spur of the moment idea that BIGGERMIL just had (SOUND FAMILIAR?). So right as we got to collegetown for an adult weekend of drinking/flirting/college parties and I hop out of the truck in my spaghetti straps and platform wedges- a big gold SUV pulls up behind us and out comes my SO’s parents. Whom I’ve never met. Who will be spending AAAALLLLLLLLLL WEEKEND at the same house. And isn’t this just great? *They* (cough) heard that both of their eldest sons would be at collegetown and decided to make it a “family thing” that weekend.

 

Hindsight is like karma. Sometimes it’s just a bitch.

 

My first impression of BIGGERMIL was that while she was short, round, country and simple (Hindsight: SHORT TRAILER TRASH WITH A WHOLE LOTTA DUMB), she was sweet and a little lonely. My own mother is more of a needy child than a trusted adult, so I thought FMIL wasn’t bad. We could be *friends*.

 

BIGGERMIL immediately latched on to me and started incessantly talking. I mean the woman was muttering in a rapid, slightly squeaky “Peggy Hill with a sinus infection” voice. While I could technically hear her, it became apparent that none of it made any sense. She was mindlessly chirping and continued this for the rest of the weekend. I mentioned it to SO that night, and he said that she’s just excited because “she never gets to talk to another female since her whole family is men.” This part is a partial truth. Her immediate family is her husband and three boys. She does have plenty of sisters, SILs, nieces and cousins but none of them talk to her (Hindsight: I WONDER WHY).

 

Over the next couple of years, as our relationship progressed, I would talk to BIGGERMIL at family parties when she was alone in a corner (Hindsight: DO NOT), I would bring extra food to her parties because she would inevitably run out (Hindsight: SHE MADE OTHER PEOPLE BRING THEIR OWN FOOD TO HER PARTY/ DO NOT), I would ask for her opinion on SO Christmas and birthday gifts (Hindsight: DOOOO NOOOOTTTTT) and I would make extra effort to be kind to her. We even went shopping few times together. She wanted me to pick out more “boobie shirts because that’s what SO is into”. (Hindsight: BARF).

 

She was a little “wacky” and “strange” and “socially stunted” but she was sweet enough. She certainly seemed thrilled when SO confided in his family that he was going to buy a ring and propose. I really, really thought that I was gaining a solid family member. Not a mother but possibly a *friend* (Hindsight: BLESS MY HEART).

 

SO took his family to see the ring he picked out. She said it was lovely. He proposed to me in a wonderful way and we called both sets of parents that night to announce the news! BIGGERMIL insisted that we come by the house so she could give me a big hug and see the ring (Hindsight: IT’S A TRAP). We arrived and FIL met us at the door. He hugged me so hard I blacked out a little. I turned to BIGGERMIL and stuck out my left hand- diamond ring catching the kitchen light and glittering. She gasped, grabbed my hand, turned it so it could catch even more light-

 

Then she dropped my hand, looked me dead in the eye and said “MY DIAMOND IS BIGGER”.

 

This was the first shot fired in what is now a lifelong battle until one of us dies. Moral of the story: They are not your *friend*. You do not need to be their *friend*. Please babies, understand this. Learn from my naiveté. You may be friendly but YOU ARE NOT *FRIENDS*."
14,"Hello again!

So update before the rant: I am getting my medical check up before starting the new job. Well one step closer to getting out of dodge.

Now did I mention that JNMom doesn't know that the job is a go?  Though that is the least of my problems.

On to the story! JNparents are visiting my favorite aunt now. Aunt is godmother to me and several cousins. In the past she has been very generous  to the point of even sponsoring my cousin's wedding attire (fully beaded gown, long veil, the works). 

I didn't want to expect the same generosity, so I went and got my gown myself at the thrift shop area. No use spending 30k to 100k pesos upwards on a gown I can wear only once. Today, JNMom messaged me out of the blue that my aunt said she would sponsor my gown.

Holy shit. Awkward.

I emailed my aunt explaining the matter and she took it well, offering to help with other things. Much appreciated.

Only remaining problem: how to tell JNMom. Assuming she doesn't know by now. FDH and my best friend are bracing for the impending drama, but they aren't the ones who will deal with JNMom next week!!"
15,"MIL was told we are moving out. Not by us, but by FIL. He seems to not be able to keep anything to himself and if there’s a pot of bullshit boiling on the stove, it seems he has to stir it. As much as you *hate* drama, you sure do love to cause it, FIL.

Anyway, MIL was told on SOs nephews 2nd birthday party. I was at work. SO was already there with LO. FIL called SO and told him that MIL angrily got out of the car in the middle of the road and decided to walk. FIL never showed up to the birthday party. He never came home for the rest of the day and the day after. 

He never said what it was about and we never asked, until we decided to tell MIL we were moving out. She just said “yeah, I was already told.” That’s all.

Now, BIL has been badgering my SO that he needs to tell mom he’s moving out. How it’s going to hurt her, how she needs to know, blah blah blah. He has also still been saying that MIL says that I’m keeping SO from her, that I’m isolating him, that I’ve blocked her on social media that *I don’t have.* When SO tries to justify my feelings, and that I’m doing *none* of those things, and gives a list of reasons I’ve distanced myself from psychotic MIL, he says, “Well that’s just mom, you still need to talk to her.”

After work I didn’t go see nephew bc I had broken out in a rash and if it was infectious I didn’t want to infect him with anything. She offered to make me soup and told me she hopes I feel better in her nice sweet voice."
16,"TRIGGER WARNING:  Brief mention of infant death

I decided that I would confront JNMom on the phone tonight about her mental illnesses and talking about son's death to my children.

I think that the bringing up her mental problems caught her off guard.  She answered in very short sentences which makes me think she know she isn't doing as much as she should.  

As far as my DS1's death I told her that I didn't want her talking to my either of my children about DS1.  She was confused.  I had to explain to her that it was inappropriate and harmful in the ways she chose to talk about his him.  She agreed to not do it anymore.  I made it clear that any mention of DS1 would mean an end to any speaking for a while.  I was honestly surprised that she agreed.  

She didn't use her usual go to of ""I forgot.""  She didn't argue.  It was actually a very smooth conversation.  I am used to her causing drama.  So, at the end, I am not sure this is a success or to expect some kind of fall out."
17,"Background: I am the 21 year old wife of my MILs 28 year old youngest son. I am also 39 weeks pregnant. MIL has multiple sisters, one of which had only daughters (MIL had only sons). One of MILs nieces is VERY close to her mother. 

MIL's niece had three home births with the aid of a midwife and MIL's Sister. Her births sound absolutely lovely from what I have heard of them and like somthing I would have absolutely loved with my own (very just yes) mother but for a verity of reasons related to my health and well-being and what is best for me and baby I am giving birth in a hospital aided by a doctor. 

When it became clear that I would be delivering in hospital I made the desision my husband and my Mom would be the only ones joining me. I am a very private person, I don't want MIL or Friends or anyone not involved in the medical care of me and this baby or the conception of this baby or my Mom in the room. MIL has not dropped it. 

Well I asked DH why his mother will not drop it and what she expects to get out of seeing her DIL push a baby out. Well aparently DH's aunt with the aid of the midwife got to rub olive oil on DH's cousins private parts to aid in the delivery of her children and MIL wants to experience that too. *que absolute look of horror, screeching sound like a dying animal and a whole lot of fuck no* 

When I told my Mom about that she had a similar reaction to me and said if I was delivering at home and we where going to try that it would be DH or the Midwife's job to rub oil on me NOT MUM'S NOT MIL'S. Mom said the only people touching my private places will be me, my doctor, my nurse, and maybe DH but probably not. And MIL will not be told I'm going to the hospital at all (and I trust DH on this. We had to go to the hospital Monday night because I thought my water broke at work and DH still hasn't told his Mom)."
18,"Hello y'guys!

Let me start off by saying that I am not new to this thread, I've thumbed through these posts rather diligently, and always have counted my blessings when reading some of the stories that come up on here. Today's conversation with her was the straw that broke the camel's back - I just *don't* know anymore. I'm sorry if this is long!

My MIL... Is something, I'm not sure. Frankly, I don't even really know how to begin, but she was never a JY - more so teetered on the JMaybe and blurred into the JN. When I started dating my now DH in January of 2016, I don't think I was their ""ideal match"" for their *oh so perfect*, well mannered, (mostly GC) eldest son. I'm not exactly their image of a *good* woman: I talk back, have a good head on my shoulders, bullheaded, and I quote ""act like less like a lady and more like a man"". If that means I'm not easily browbeat, submissive, *and quiet* as a woman should be, then I suppose I do act like a man. I am also two years older than him, so I was *stealing him away*! It was an active joke that I robbed the cradle because we got together a couple months before he turned 16 and I was 17, turning 18 three months after. I was born in 1998, he was born in 2000. It was funny once or twice, but *y'know,* a year later, it *wasn't*.

My husband and I grew up in two very different households: he basically had a nanny from the time he was little that folded his laundry, did the yard-work, cleaning, and cooking - these skills were not *really* taught to him. He grew up comfortably middle class. My parents split when I was 14 or 15, and so I grew up *very* quickly in order to provide for myself, my little brothers, and my mother. I also grew up in a progressive household, my aunt was adamant that I learned my value and knew how much I was worth from a young age, as she had endured a marriage with a man who thought her place was in the kitchen. Needless to say, she built me up from the time I was little. My husband's family, however, sits somewhere between the modern family where women work/etc, but also should know their place. This did not sit well on my pallet, obviously.

I realized really early on that they might be.. ""JustMaybe"" in total when they started in on how I dressed: comfortably, t-shirts, leggings, jeans, usually men's shirts on the small/medium because they looked cool or had neat designs. I finally got them to stop when I nonchalantly said, ""I didn't know clothing had a gender"". They dropped it. I have curly/wavy hair. *THIS IS A HILL I WILL DIE ON*, they constantly want me to cut it, straighten it, *brush* it, *do something* with it. I was picked on a lot for my hair as a child, so it's a wound they poke *constantly*. I love my hair - they just don't understand because their hair is so very straight, very, very straight.

For the last bit of context: my husband is in the Marine Corps and we are stationed in Hawaii - 4K miles away. He is currently deployed to Japan, due home for Christmas. I *hesitantly* agreed to go home for his Christmas leave for 9 days (21st-29th) because it would be our *first* Christmas together as a *married* couple. We briefly hashed out that we would spend 3 days with my ILs, 3 days with my aunt, and 3 days with a *very*  close friend of mine who I consider to be *neutral* ground. I digress, as this has been a sore topic for me (-:

My MIL calls me at work, which is fine, I'm going to lunch in about 10 minutes, so I answer. We chat, nonchalantly, and for some reason, our housing accommodation for Christmas comes up. *This* is not a conversation I want to have. I'm nervous, I kinda chuckle a little as she assumes we're (over my dead body) staying at their place for the entirety of the nine days. I can hear it and my stomach is in knots, she knows something is wrong. I briefly explained the 3/3/3 situation and she was hot. ""What do you mean you're staying with (friend) when he has family that hasn't seen him in over a year!"" If I had a heart monitor hooked up, I'd have flat-lined then and there. I told her, ""Well, no matter \*what we do\*, someone is going to be upset with \*me\*"", and I essentially dropped that rope and didn't try to pick it up and the conversation ended there.

I just... It niggled me, all the way till lunch, where I sat out under the stupid tree and cried over it. What about MY family who hasn't seen ME in almost a year? MY friends. What about *OUR* mutual friends, who undoubtedly, WILL want to see us.  Y'know, I'm just *attached* to his hip, I'm REALLY feeling like I'm just an unwanted accessory her son comes with.


tldr; But - MIL forgets I also have family and wants us to spend the entirety of our Christmas leave at their house and is upset because we're splitting our time evenly among family."
19,"[Back story post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/d3zbzm/finding_my_spine_after_20_years_of_jnm_abuse/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

JNM was visiting me when I was 8 months pregnant to help me finish the baby room, etc. Plan was for her to stay until a couple weeks after the birth but she went crazy on me and started calling me evil. Screaming in my face. It was ugly and borderline traumatizing, but nothing new, really (I've experienced this decal times my entire life). She also kept screaming about how she couldn't stand staying in my house and how much she wanted to leave, so I called her out on it and asked her to leave. She interprets this as me ""kicking her out"".

Anyway, I have  given birth to my daughter and now she refuses to come back to meet her. The only reason I'm even extending the invite is because my brother told me that my mom expects me to use my daughter as leverage to ""make her change"". I am not interested in using my daughter as a way of manipulation with my JNM. And I know that if I don't extend the invite, she will claim that I'm ""keeping DD from her"". DH and I agreed that JNM can visit whenever she wants for 3 days max but she will never be allowed to see DD unsupervised.

Anyway, not that my invite even matters because she apparently expects ME to apologize to HER about what happened. I flat out said that I have nothing to apologize for and I don't even care if she apologizes to me (conversation via text) My relationship with her is done but I won't prevent her from getting to know her granddaughter. But she wouldn't budge about coming to see the baby. She wouldn't even acknowledge her behavior in the incident. In fact, all of her replies were almost as if she didn't even read anything I said. She just kept saying things like ""as long as you're happy. That's all I want for you."" Or ""I will always love you"". Basically a bunch of crap that further instills in her own mind that she is somehow the ""victim"" in this situation. I ignored it.

My dad and brother came to visit without JNM. The entire weekend my dad sent her pics of me and the baby and she would say things like ""we are so blessed to have such a beautiful granddaughter. I love them both!"" 

She also texted me several things about how much she loves me and is always on my side, how amazing DD is, etc. I just said thanks.

I'm the end I didn't lose any sleep about her not coming to visit. It was a really nice stress free visit with just my dad and bro. But I do feel pity for her that she is so delusional about herself as well as egotistical to the point that she can't set aside the issues between me and her for 3 days to meet her first (and most likely only) grandchild. At least I know that I have given her every opportunity to see the baby, no strings attached but she is too proud to do it. Probably for the best."
20,"Where do I start, honestly just need to vent somehow and possibly get another person’s perspective.  I hope it’s okay to talk about it in this thread, it’s the only one I could find that’s remotely similar. 
So, my Boyfriend’s mother treats my boyfriend like a two year old and tries to control every single aspect of his life. 
Also, she loves to make out like she’s the sweetest lady you’ll ever meet, but then drive you crazy and make your mental health go to crap. 
Trust me, she’s terrible. 
The latest though, in the never ending saga of issues to do with her, is a missing birthday card from September. 
My boyfriend so sweetly made me a birthday card, and put it somewhere safe. That night, while I was at his house, he went to where he put the card, or thought he put it, and it was gone. Of course, he looked super shocked about it as he was certain he put the card in his bedside drawer. He then proceeded to go through every drawer in his bedroom and practically tear every area he could think of apart to find this card. We couldn’t find it anywhere. 
Now, since his mother is a “lovely” lady, she kept positive, joking around about how he’s silly for forgetting the safe place he put my card and saying that it will turn up eventually. 
Fast track to a week later, I was hiding how upset I was about it, but she continues to ask if he’d found it and then laugh about how silly he was for forgetting where it was. 
One more week passes, at this point it’s over with and we’ve accepted an alien has probably abducted the card for research, she asks again if he had found it...  this time he wasn’t looking at her, I look up to see a sickly sweet smirk on her face. I tried not to think too far into it though, maybe I misinterpreted her expression...  nah. 
Then tonight, while I was chatting to my boyfriend on the phone...  She butts in, she always does. This time though, she asks about the birthday card...  it’s been well over a month since my birthday now, I had completely forgotten about it. All of a sudden all of the pieces felt like they had come together. 
He was certain he put that card in his drawer, he only keeps socks in this drawer...  she puts his washing away because her darling little boy doesn’t need that responsibility...  is it wrong of me to think the only logical thing that’s happened to that birthday card is that she’s taken it and hidden it somewhere for herself?
Normally, I wouldn’t assume things like this about anyone, but she’s really something else. 
It’s something special her son made, something he apparently spent hours making.  I can imagine she wouldn’t care about who it was for, as long as she could keep it instead. 
I’ve never in my whole life met anyone who’s so fake and who acts so sweet and innocent, just to be able to manipulate and control people. She’s done so much that makes my blood boil, this just seems like one more possibility to add to the long list."
21,"So this afternoon I was in the bathtub when I heard a man’s voice obviously upset on the phone. At first I thought it was my landlord upstairs and even texted my husband, “It sounds like our landlord is really getting into it with someone lol!” 

I get out of the bath and go into the kitchen. In walks my husband walking through the door saying, “we’re done talking. There’s no resolution to this.” And he hung up the phone. 

I asked him who that was and it was JUSTNOMIL. He then tells me that he got a text from her an hour prior saying, “Hi (myhusband)! For your birthday on Saturday we’d love to take you and (ourdaughter) out for dinner! What time works for you?”

He then called to clarify the text and ask if they intentionally meant to leave me out of the festivities. They confirmed yes, they want only my husband and daughter to join. Since they found out we’re moving across the country next month, they have blamed it all on me even though I couldn’t force my husband to do anything if I tried lol. It was a mutual decision but ultimately, as usual, I’m the bad guy. They basically said I’d be coming for a free meal (not to celebrate my husband of course!). 

The difference in our socioeconomic backgrounds has been a major issue for them since we met because at that time I was unemployed with no education. Single Mom just added to the disapproval. I’ve since gone back to school and work a great job but they still view me in that light from their high horse. 

Anyways, you would think that if they wanted any sort of relationship with their son, they wouldn’t actively hate his wife. But you’d be wrong! 

My husband basically told them to fuck off and we’re celebrating his birthday next week with his brother and sister in law. Only five weeks until we’re out of here!

ETA: I did NOT expect this to blow up. Thank you so much for all of the support! I’m sure my husband will be getting a phone call from JUSTNOFIL soon so I’ll update when it happens ;)

Second edit: Thank you to u/A_Redheads_Ramblings for dubbing JUSTNOMIL “Queen Plastic”. It’s perfect ;)"
22,"First time poster. Looking for any advice. 

Moved in with my partner and FMIL in Nov 2018. All was fine for about a month and a half. However, I started to notice how she spoke and treated my partner. She would sit on her ass and demand he clean the house, cook for her, go shopping for her and not give him back the money. Now the house was disgusting, covered in dirt. I used to do a 9 hour shift and come home to scrub at the floors, clean out the washing machine which was filthy and she never minded, she would watch me from the sofa clean her own house. My partner then told me that FMIL never cleaned. She would always have an excuse, that she was ill or her back hurt. Now she did dance in her spare time, so I know that was total bs. I told my partner very carefully as I was unsure how he would react that I thought she treated him badly, the way she spoke down to him, no one would speak to their son like that. To my surprise, my partner agreed, he thought she spoke to him like he was a piece of crap too.

Side note: We each paid her £200 towards bills, she didn't want it classed as rent as she was going through a divorce and didn't want her ex claiming 50% of it. When this was later brought up and he wrote a letter to her solicitor demanding his half, she said we would need to pay him £400 too, so basically £800!!

The longer time went on, the more I saw her true side. She would bitch about everything and anyone. Her closest ‘friends’ personal lives were gossiped about, she would laugh at their misfortunes. She was a catholic, and to the outside world she was a saint but inside she was nasty and horrible, self-centred. I soon discovered she was a narcissist, I did a lot of research on this personality disorder and she ticked all the boxes. She is a compulsive liar, she fabricates memories and stories to make herself look good, she never admits to anything or takes the blame when she is in the wrong, she has ‘selective amnesia’, when caught in a lie she pretends like the other person telling us the truth is lying. She puts others down and when anyone criticises her, she says they are just jealous of how smart and beautiful she is. Now I would never say anyone is ugly, but if you saw this woman you would agree, she is ugly inside and out. 

**Example**

I was ill in hospital for a week at the beginning of Nov 2018. My partner was amazing, as well as working 12 hour shifts he would come sit with me as I was in and out of consciousness. Now FMIL never came to see me, she claimed she didn’t have time. Skip ahead to Jan 2019, I get notified to a tweet FMIL made in Nov 2018 about me. A nurse friend at the hospital sent her a text message saying she had seen me and my partner and she was praising my partner for being an amazing person for looking after me, I totally agree he was the best in this horrible time. Now, instead of messaging this to her son, she decided to post it on Twitter with #proudmummy and decided to tell all her followers why I was in hospital (wasn’t bad just embarrassing, I had a bladder infection and felt very vulnerable at that time, not a time I wish to remember as I hate hospitals). Now FMIL had never once messaged her son, never said anything to his face about being proud of him. My partner didn’t follow her on Twitter so how, and this I did ask her was he supposed to know you were proud of him if that was why you posted it. I messaged her quite politely and asked if she wouldn’t mind deleting the posts as they were A) Nothing to do with her and B) private and personal to me and I didn’t want her followers knowing anything about it. Her reaction, to make her Twitter profile Private. Very mature I know. She never messaged me back and when I saw she had made everything private to block me from seeing I tried to call her, she didn’t pick up. Bare in mind her phone is glued to her hand all the time. Pathetic. She then messaged saying that what she posted on Twitter was her own affair and nothing to do with me. I kid you not, I was raging at this. So, she thinks posting embarrassing information about me, without my consent, about a situation which had nothing to do with her is totally fine but when I ask her politely to remove it, she blocks me and refuses to speak to me. She then gave me the silent treatment for weeks and things were never the same. 

Plenty more examples of how she was a bitch to me and her son but I’ll save those for another time. Totally crazy woman. Anyways, we moved out at the end of February 2019. We didn’t want to give her any more of our money, she had received £850 so far from us towards the bills and we discovered at the beginning of February that she had not been paying a lot of the bills. The council tax was outstanding by £650, she had maxed out her credit card to £3,700, she had not been paying her half of the mortgage £400 – (her ex and her are going through a divorce, he owns 50% and pays his half). She had taken our money and blown it up the wall on herself. New clothes, getting her hair professional cut and dyed every month (waste of money if you ask me, still looks tacky), going to four Christmas dinners and parties, spending money on herself constantly. We said we would pay her after we left as we had used all out savings on a deposit and first months rent. The day we moved out she was weirdly nice (I put this down to just wanting our money and being pretend nice). We messaged her and said we had put keys through the door (she was not at home). She came back and said we didn’t need to do that, and we were both welcome anytime. Then came the follow up message, ‘did you leave the £350 on the side for me?’. My partner quickly told her no and that she had £850 already and that was more than enough for the utilities we used in the 3 months we were there. Well, the switch flipped, and she was very nasty. She called him a vile child, he was horrible. He got very upset. I decided to message her, I told her in a calm way she was not getting another penny from us, we had cleaned for her when she did nothing, we worked full time so we were only there in the evenings and some weekends. We said we knew she had blown the £850 on herself, we found the debt letters she had not yet paid. And then came the funniest message ever. So all the rumours we had been told, that she was bitching about me behind my back for months, that she never liked me, the rumours she said were false and that she loved me being there, yep all true. She called me poisonous, neurotic (had to google that one), said I was vile person and she feared for her son’s life. The same son in the previous message she was calling all the names under the sun. Yeah, she never liked me, hated me. She said she always cleaned up after us, which made us almost wet ourselves. Since then she has barely messaged him. We have built our lives back up, had a few wobbles but now on track and doing well in our new clean home.

Come to now, so FMIL is going through this dragged out divorce, she put the house on the market, she has done nothing to the house, mould everywhere, dirty carpets, etc. She messaged my partner a few weeks ago complaining about her EX, saying he is now blocking the sale because she demanded more from the house sale. Now, bare in mind she hasn’t paid rent in ages, god know how much she owes them. He has been paying rent, he wants her out of the house so he can do it up to sell it, she is refusing to leave so he is going through the courts, she is now threatening to not sign the divorce papers until he agrees to give her 75-80% of the proceeds from the sale. I don’t see why they don’t just split 50/50 and end this bs. She is only looking for attention from my partner, she never asks him how he is doing, she just sends page after page of rants and then when she’s gotten the attention she seeks, she doesn’t bother him for a few more months. It’s only when her ‘friends’ are busy with their own lives that she messages him. 

What should we do, I’ve tried to help him and told him to just block her and let her sort her own shit out. She is guilt tripping him, she is saying she is going to be homeless and keeps trying to find out our address (shocker we never told her). I do not want that woman coming anywhere near our house, she will never leave. I’m not stopping him from messaging her, its not my place to, that’s his decision but every time she texts him more guilt trip stuff he gets upset and feels bad. I just wish she would leave us alone, we are trying to live our lives and don’t want to deal with anymore of her drama. 

Sorry for the long rant. 

Any advice welcome, thank you."
23,"For backstory my husband and I grew up in a religion that borderlines on cult (and by that I mean its pretty much a cult) just this year we read some information about the history of the church and left it. This upset my family and his. I've been fighting with mine almost non stop since but his seemed awkward but accepting, at first. When we told them we were leaving their church we told them we didnt want them teaching our kids about it at all. We then went to their house for dinner and they decided to have there normal bible study session and we said we wouldn't be sticking around for it. They got upset and argued a little but accepted it in the end. Their reason was it wasn't about the church it was about moses, whose in the bible, so it should be ok. We said no, no kind of religion talk and it ended. Ok thats the backstory. 

A month ago my daughter asked if she could spend the night at mils house. Mil said yes, but she'd prefer the next night so maybe she could spend the night twice. I found that a little odd since they've never asked for 2 nights before and what was so special about the next night? I said na, I want my daughter back but I'll talk to husband and debate it. They call me the next day and have daughter ask if she can spend the night again. I can hear grandma telling her what to say in the background but once more, I dont think anything of it besides her having fun and wanting to stay. The next day we pick her up and she starts telling us all about the fun she had, except when they made her talk to the missionaries. Obviously we got PISSED. We specifically said no to church talk and they had her take a lesson from missionaries?! So we decided no more sleep overs. We didn't confront them because I didn't want to fight. Im non confrontational and they cant admit when they are in the wrong. That was our big mistake. The other day they ask if she can spend the night while we are over. We say no. She then turns and tells our daughter she was spending the night!! So guess who threw a fit and cried the whole fucking way home because grandma said she was spending the night! We then got a text asking why we wouldnt let her spend the night so we told them flat out why. An hour later and we are STILL fighting, they are justifying it because it was about the holy ghost and lots of religions have a holy ghost so its ok. They claimed ahe wanted to hear them speak they (no she didn't) and that it was just a small lesson so no hatm no foul. But they deliberately went behind our backs and did something we asked them not to do. Then my husband little brother, whos 17, gets involved and starts texting my husband how mean hes being to mil. That REALLY set him off. How dare they let him get involved. They now want to come over Saturday to discuss this in person because we didn't budge on the issue. I dont want to meet them because I know what they are going to do. Cry and make us out to be sooooo mean, never own up to their mistakes and justify it. They kept pushing and pushing to meet with us in person and my husband gave in as long as it was at our house so on our turf. I'm pretty sure he wants to confront his mom cuz he is REALLY  upset, but I dont want to. I dont articulate well when I'm angry. I get flustered and just sound stupid because my brain goes so fast my mouth cant keep up. Idk what to do and I'm starting to get anxiety over it and have panic attacks."
24,"maybe not as crazy as some of the others on this sub, but I figured I might as well share my story.

As a few of you might remember from [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/cykmh0/mom_doesnt_trust_me_to_stay_in_their_house_while/) about a month ago, my parents are on a vacation in Europe until January. To recap: they kicked my cousin out (he was staying with them and they rightfully didn't trust him to be there by himself), explicitly told me I was not allowed to stay in their house. At the same time I am expected me to come check on their mail, take care of their two amazon parrots in my one bedroom apartment, and keep their weekend car in my garage (silver lining: I'm ""allowed"" to drive the car to and from work), as well as clean the house when guests are coming to stay. I decided not to rock the boat, despite my SO's urging to confront them about it, because I figured it wouldn't be worth the headache. I couldn't stay there, but hey, neither could my irresponsible drunkard of a cousin.  And, since she'd been crying to me right before they left about how she wanted to fix our relationship, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and respected her wishes of them not wanting me there.

Fast forward to this morning.

She casually mentions that my cousin is now allowed to spend the weekends at their house. They have left him no responsibilities, have also left him their sedan (I got the tiny car), and he has done NOTHING to prove he is responsible--in particular, he was supposed to get a place to stay, and he hasn't even been able to do that, even though he brings in twice the amount monthly that I do. I, apparently, am still not allowed to stay at their house, no reason given.

Understandably, I'm quite upset, considering that it would 1. be better for the birds to be at home and 2. would allow me to get a good night's sleep (see: light and noise pollution) and 3. My cousin fucked up, and is now getting rewarded for his irresponsible behavior. So I let her know that my feelings were hurt. She responded with the classic ""I don't understand"" tactic, so I took her response and spelled it out point by point. I avoided the use of ""you"" as much as possible, and had a third party read it to make sure it was clear and reasonable in my explanation.

Well, dear friends, I finally have my proof that this relationship is completely irredeemable. Before I even finished posting (we're using an IM system) she started typing, and immediately responded with some bullshit about trust and ME hurting HER feelings for feeling this way. I can tell she shut down completely, and didn't bother to read or even try to understand what I wrote, so at this point I feel like anything I say will just be wasted words.

Folks, I'm done. The fact that she didn't even try proves that she didn't actually want to fix anything, and it's completely wrecked me--I really hoped she would turn around, I really \*wanted\* her to turn around. But I'm just so tired of being the one to do all the work. I'm done trying to be the responsible one, the one they can rely on to take care of everything.

My SO and I have planned to elope. We're having a courthouse wedding in January, then moving across the country and taking her birds with us to go live with his parents instead. I'm so scared--I've been under their spell for so long, that even just thinking about doing something they wouldn't approve of is giving me the shakes, but I'm an adult, god damnit, and I don't need this in my life. I just hope they're happy knowing that their only child is never going to talk openly with them about anything ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT thank you all for the advice, I will definitely start building a paper trail regarding the birds. After calming down a bit, I've realized that just taking them away might not be the best idea but I will sure try my damn hardest to get their custody in writing. ALSO I absolutely **WILL NOT** leave the birds with my cousin--part of his being irresponsible is that he's left them without food, has left their cage open while opening windows, and once even tried to get them high on weed, so I don't trust him to not kill them and I will not endanger any animal in that way. I would rather board them or even adopt them out than let him attempt to take care of them."
25,"So I just found out that my MIL had given my husband  $15,000 back in August right before my daughter was born, with specific instructions not to tell me, and that the money was to be for his use only. I only found out while looking for a stamp in his office desk when I discovered the little note and the check for $15k. This is the same MIL who complains that we aren’t close and she wishes we had a mother/daughter relationship. Right after my daughter was born (before I discovered this little financial gift) she gripes non stop about how I invited my mother to stay in our home for 2 weeks, and her only a week. My MIL is the type that uses offers of “help” as opportunities to try and control. Am I overreacting or is this bitch shady?


EDIT; Just a note that I am reading all your comments and will reply back once I get the babies to bed."
26,"My (23 y/0) husband and I (20 y/o) have been married about two months now. I’ve met his step mom for a total of three times. A little background is that my husband has never had a good relationship with his step mom. Since he was a kid she would always tell him that he’s the reason the marriage is failing between her and FIL. He’s always been picked on by her after she had kids. 
Moving on.... She’s always been nice, we have normal conversations and things seem to go well until I leave. She starts nagging to my father in law to why I have a certain brand of clothing that she doesn’t have. The family is wealthy and she spends an insane amount of money on her self. One time she went and had an argument to my FIL to why my husband and I joke around with Each-other and they don’t do that. One time, My FIL said love you before hanging up in the phone and she started an argument with him into how he said “love you” to me. A few days ago my brother in law who is (14y/o) wanted to spend the night so my FIL dropped him off. My MIL then called my husband saying that if he doesn’t bring his brother to his house she’ll call the cops ( she’s called the cops on FIL multiple times if things don’t go her way). After dropping off brother in law she called my husband and started yelling about why he didn’t drop him off immediately, about how I am stopping him from listening to her. She told him that I am a bad influence and I influenced her son to yell back at her once he got home. 
So my problem is, I don’t know how to approach this, do I just let her start arguments with my FIL because I exist and stay quiet? Or should I actually approach her? But I’m a little scared to do that because she may make things worse."
27,"So my FDH called her today and told her we all need to talk about the issues once and for all.  So I get a text from her saying:

 “can’t you send me pictures of the kids? And (FDH)  said we have to “work out our issues” so what exactly are you looking for?”   


I responded saying “ (FDH) and I will arrange a time to call you and speak to you together .”   

she said “what about my pictures”

I didn’t respond- not after the way she’s talked to me and treated my son and the rest of my family .   I refuse to talk to her without my FDH present.  No respect, no pictures 🤷🏼‍♀️.

28,"Hi there. I've posted once before about my fMIL, and her annoying comments. This is another one of those posts. On mobile.
My bf &amp; I went to a halloween party this past Saturday that his uncle was throwing, it was an intimate party, only family. I wasn't feeling well, mostly anxiety from being around people I'm not very familiar with, so at one point I hid in the basement. My bf came down to check on me, and his mom folllowed. She asked what was wrong with me (I'd told her three (3) times that I just wasn't feeling well. Why my word wasn't good enough escapes me) and he just blurted out ""she's pregnant"" because... I'm not entirely sure, honestly. It's not a funny joke or prank, &amp; in any setting where someone would say that &amp; it's not true I'd be uncomfortable &amp; upset. I did talk to him about that &amp; explained how it made me feel. But this isn't JNSO, &amp; tbh he's not JN. Okay moving on.
I'm not sure what reaction he was hoping for but she immediately clapped her hands &amp; said ""PREGNANT?! THAT'S GREAT!! For me, of course. Not for you."" I just gave a weak laugh &amp; went to the bathroom, my head spinning. The weird thing to me was I'd been explaining to my bf just more hours earlier why I spent so much time on this subreddit. I said it was to help me learn the warning signs not just of his mom, but my own mom. I've learned a lot from this subreddit &amp; I went over some of those things with him. He usually just ignores his mom when she talks, but afterwards I just repeated the conversation word for word &amp; watched the realization dawn on his face. The next day I started writing out rules for when we do eventually try for a baby. It's a decent sized list, currently.

I guess I just want to know if I'm reading too much into her comments, even though my months of reading here has taught me to be wary &amp; file away her words for the future. I'm extremely nervous about speaking up, because for some reason I just can't accept the fact that his family doesn't bond over throwing darts at a picture of my face. I think I'm nervous that if I stand up against her comments it will make my fears true &amp; they'll band against me. My bf doesn't think it's a big deal if they aren't in love with me, but I'm just naturally a people pleaser &amp; it would pain me so much if my negative thoughts turned into more than thoughts.
Alright rambling over."
29,"Let me preface with: D(ear) H and I have been married for 3 years and together for 5 before that. We are NC with nMIL after years of VVVVVLC. Currently VLC with eFIL (that's about to change) and VLC with SIL's as we are watching them transition into adulthood. They are beginning to see the toxicity, we'll see how it goes with them but I'm not holding out hope. 

No advice wanted but feel free to chime in. 

nMIL is a classic narcissist. Married eFIL purely for opportunity. She admits it and has said it out loud many times to her kids. They got married after a couple months, and before their first (my DH) was even born, things already began to sour. They are still together to this day as 1) they site their religion as the reason they cannot divorce and 2) the whole ""staying together for the kids"" BS. My DH grew up in a fighting/divided household and it's been that way for as long as he can remember.  Needless to say, my IL's are trainwrecks. nMIL financially abuses eFIL, has even been known to be physically abusive towards him. Their finances are a mess and like many other IL's on this thread, they don't have any friends that stick around for more than a year. 

eFIL is very open about his fucked up relationship with nMIL. He acknowledges the abuse and knows there is something REALLY not right with nMIL. Openly tells anyone who is willing to listen how his wife bullies their children, instigates fights between them, has driven a wedge between everyone, constantly puts them down and will likely use and abuse SIL's in the future as she has done with him. They've been her FM's in the past but they're older now and beginning to realize shit ain't right. eFIL is very much absent and of course, doesn't do shit about shit. Acknowledges the abuse and unhealthy relationships but just lets it happen. 

eFIL disgusts me. I'm realizing I will have to go from VLC to VVVVVVLC or even NC with him in the future. DH will never be NC with him because he feels bad for eFIL and they really had some sort of a bond when he was a child. I'm okay with that. I used to pity him as well until I realized I just don't give a shit and seeing the way he chooses to live his life and let that monster run their family into the ground... Disgusting

What made me realize this? A couple weeks ago he called to catch up with DH. Conversations are always welcome as he's typically pleasant, asks about DH's job, my job, how we're doing etc. He told us SIL#1 has gotten a job (finally, lazy ass). He was happy bcuz this meant there is finally reason to get her to leave the house and she'll have the opportunity to see examples of how people should behave, examples of common courtesy and decency that nMIL is extremely lacking. He says ""Bellatrix is going to see how things work in the real world and it's going to be a ruuuuuuuude awakening"" with a big ass smile plastered on his face clearly getting enjoyment out of the fact that his daughter was going to be faced with a mountain of self-doubt, depression and unhappiness soon. 

You never cared for your kids. You may have cared about your son in the past and have attempted to protect him maybe twice in the 29 years of his life. As for your daughters, you don't give a shit about them. You groomed them to be more easily abused by their mom. You get joy out of seeing them go through turmoil like a form of ""I told you so"". You smile when they have disagreements with their mom that end in tears. You don't lift a finger or make any effort to reaffirm the feelings they are having about their mom/upbringing as the FOG begins to lift and they start realizing they are just pawns. You would never defend them because YOU TOO are so desperate for eMIL's approval. You are just like her. No you are WORSE. You know better but you have never and will never do better. You let the abuse happen. You continued to have children with her when she showed you who exactly she was after kid #1. You let her deplete you of all your resources. You make shitty decisions yourself and blame it on being in a relationship with her. You allowed her to alienate you from your own family. You keep nMIL around so you have someone to blame for how miserable your life is but there is no one to blame but yourself. You have turned into her. Fuck you, JNeFIL."
30,"This is a quick thing that came across my mind when I was scrollong through r/insaneparents and I don't know if it is /something/ but it feels weird.

So I am 22, and currently live in a student dorm with 2 new (2 and 1 month ago) roommates who are 28 and freshly 19. 

When you see the 19 year old, you think ""kid"" cos she is very sweet and this is the first time she's away from her parents, they call a lot, she calls a lot, goes back home every weekend. 

When she goes out to choir in the evening, especially now in the wintertime, I found myself thinking ""oh no, she's out there in the dark, I hope everything's alright."" I don't call or text or anything, but I am always relieved? When she comes back. Maybe I watch too much True Crime shows.

Which brings me to my mother. 
Starting from when I was 14, I had a pretty weird and toxic relationship via the internet with someone twice my age, but that's another story. I also went out sometimes. And came back late. Very late. 

My mother did not care.

More than once I would come back hours after I said I would be home. No phonecall, no text ""R U Ok"" or anything like that. When I came home, my mom would be asleep in bed. That's alright, I mean, nothing ever happened. It made me feel like it didnt matter what happened to me, to her. 
It was kinda cool as a teen you know, no curfew and even if you did break it, no consequences. 

My dad would be awake, but I can't tell if because of his game of because of me. He started playing WoW when it came out and hasnt stopped since. Also another story for another time( and maybe another place).

But then when I was 15, in the middle or later part of grade ten, I had an amazing opportunity: Spend the next grade (11) in the UK or USA (I am from Germany) as an exchange student. My grades were good, my English grades were even better, my teachers recommended it and me, my cousins had done it, it would look GREAT on any job or uni application and everyone in my family was supportive. 

Everyone you say? Hah! Not my mother, who, for some reason suddenly cared where I was. She forvid me from taking this amazing opportunity. Why? Because my future university or employer would see my cv and there would be a whole, year sized GAP in it. ? No, it would say ""spent a year as an exchange student, widened her horizon by staying in a different country at 16, learned independence and life lessons, ..."" you get what I am saying. 

My cousins would produce their grades ""Look how they write it! Both of us (now both 30ish) have great unis/employers now because of this"" 
Yes, you did great. My daughter still wont go.

Why not? BECAUSE IT WILL SHOW YOUR EMPLOYERS YOU FUCKEY AROUND FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN YOU HAVE TO REPEAT GRADE 11. 
Ok. Invalid commentary, as I was already skipping a grade? Normal school time in GER is 13 years, I did 12 due to my school. 

Anyways even her dad, the old grumpy choleric ass he is, told me to go. It would be good. But even he could not help.

This all culminated in her getting drunk one evening (she is on sick leave rn but before that, drunk mom every second friday /at least/, also another story) , coming into my room and suffocating me in a hug.

""You can't leave, you're my baaaaaabyyyyy you CANT LEAVE ME!!!!"" 

I cried, she cried, albeit very different reasons, and I did not go. I am still bitter that she stopped me from this, bc that was the easiest way I could have gone to another country for so long. (Money would not play a part cos my whole family, both sides, were willing to put up money and the programm wouldve been paid for by the state at least halfway.)

I am still very pissed because, after school I did a volunteer year in a youth club in the neighborhood bc I has just NO IDEA what I could do? Im a leaner by doing, so uni isnt rlly for me. So I found what I wanted to do (Event management) sent over 100 applications, got maybe 5 rejections and 1 interview (at what turned out a very shitty place) and all she had to say was ""It's because you're fat. You have the skills but in that branche they want pretty girls."" Ok thx

So then I worked some part time jobs, tried to go to uni, failed, and am now in another city at another uni. All in all, I fucked around for TWO years that can not be explained away by something as cool as ""exchange year encouraged by teachers and principal"". Now, does this in any way correlate or causate with her not letting me go? I do not know. Neither do you. But does it feel like something was taken from me that could have helped me figure out who I am and who I want to be? Yes. 
.

.

.

Was that also the year where she told me I was faking depression for attention because I'm a stupid idiot who saw people cutting on the internet and then I did it too because I wanted her to look like a bad mother and it was an overall horrid year where some space from her could habe really helped me? Sure thing :)"
31,"So the dragon lady just got back from Korea where she was visiting for a very blissful month. During that time it was D(ear)H, FIL and I in the house and **everyone** seemed less tense. While she was gone, some convenient happenstance meant that my baking hobby took a professional turn and I ended up catering for a friend's child birthday party. That went well, and a woman who attended with her kid contacted me asking if I could do the same for her this week! So today, I baked the cupcakes and will be icing them soon. 

They were all nicely baked, still warm and slightly soft so I was gently spooning them out of the tin onto a cooling rack. The dragon lady began peering at me from the kitchen door before literally stomping over, and then she begins to pluck the cakes out of the tin by hand with her fingers. Now, I'm not new to this baking thing, it has been a hobby for years, so I do what I do **for a reason**! I immediately protested and tried to show her that in picking the warm and slightly soft cakes out of the tin like that, she was pulling away the wrapper from the sides! She tried to assure me she was not and refused to believe otherwise until I showed her the loose cake wrappers. These cake cases were specifically provided to me by the customer because she wanted them to match her theme, I can't afford to waste any of them because my bloody MIL can't keep her fingers off of things. Thankfully the damage wasn't irreparable but her inability to keep out of people's business and her belief that she knows everything better than everyone else is enough to make me want to pull my hair out."
32,"Well, I have some updates. This is going to be a long post so if you don't want to read it, know that there is a happy ending. 

If you look at my last post, you'll see that my SO's parents were coming through for an event. The dinner and after-dinner entertainment went by without a hitch - no drama, no stress, just fine and dandy. SO and I were pleasantly surprised by their behavior. We expected a religious spiel (which will still come once LO is born...) but for now, we're simply continuing with our lives. 

Onto the second update: war did happen that evening as expected. We'd barely taken our coats off before sitting down with them and it was filled with tears, wild accusations, and a lot of stress that I would rather have avoided. I did check my contract which stated that if one party wanted out, the other party could buy them out at market value or the house would be sold and the amount split between the parties. I confirmed with them that if we couldn't find common ground on visitation rights, then I would like to sell my share. 

To say that one could hear a pin drop would be an understatement. They asked if I was sure about this, and I stood firm and told them I was. They accused my SO of brainwashing me, said a few other choice things, but ultimately I told them that I won't tolerate it any longer and unless they can treat us both with respect, the proceedings to follow will be messy and ugly. In the end, it was simple to find respective lawyers to handle it. I didn't want to sell according to the market value so I opted for them to buy my share as it stood. They agreed. A lot of people told me I was being foolish, but I need to be able to sleep at night knowing I made the right choice - and for me, it was settling with that share and not taking a tainted cent of that house. I have some money set aside that will be used to pay for reparations to the house before we leave as agreed upon, and I can honestly say that this feels like a new beginning. It was all signed off this week so I am essentially mortgage free! 

A contract was drawn up in which we will be paying board until we find a house to live in - something that we both appreciate. I know that the financial strain will be great on them, and I will always feel a bit guilty for the part I've played in this nightmare - but I also understand that we are all adults and make our own decisions. I do wish things could have been different, but I will not feel guilty for meeting the love of my life and wanting to move on. I know that deep down they understand this too, and it'll take time, but our relationship may become stronger once we are no longer under the same roof. 

I know that my father is a JN too and an enabler. He's stayed mostly quiet throughout everything because he doesn't want to cause me unnecessary stress or harm to LO. I honestly appreciate that, and expect that once LO is born, we will have a long heart to heart about all of this. I think that it's useful for all of us to be in therapy (individual of course, or myself and SO maybe) to help heal the pain this has caused us all. My SO is taking things particularly hard because he feels like a failure and he started playing into their hands with the brainwashing thing which I told him he's not. I make my own free choices, and I choose my marriage and family now. We did a marriage course (I must give a shout-out to the Alpha courses here :) ) and it's honestly ripped us raw and highlighted areas that we need to work on. We're so much stronger for it too, and cannot wait to have a place of our own! Hopefully we can arrange one before LO comes in January so with any luck, this missy will be late! 

A new beginning ahead, and hopefully I don't need to return to this sub for a long time except to lurk :) I want to thank everyone who reached out to me and offered such kind words during my distress - I appreciate you all x"
33,"OH's birthday is today. He's in his 30s. He's working, still, to finish up things Slurrsula was contracted to do and can't because of her injury. He's pulling 12 hr+ days and often sleeps at his job. He will not be home tonight because of these obligations that she foisted onto him because of her injury. I might get to sleep next to him again come November, based on the deadline for the extra shit. Slurrsula's going to try to get the money for that work out of him one way or another, probably by skipping the utility payments. Again. 

Good thing I'm working 3 jobs and my busy season is apparently here, I guess.

All he can do today, it seems, is apologize for her behavior and say that he loves me. I know he's not enjoying the day by himself and he's likely checking in with me to keep himself from a rage spiral. 

Slurrsula has been drunk since I got home, ranting and raving, wailing loudly enough for neighbors to hear that she just wants to die, please kill her now. I went ahead and warned him that if he had plans to stop by the house, not to. It's not where he needs to be today.

And, of the two of us, he's the one who said, ""Well, a birthday is a thing a kid and their mom have in common. It's a big day for both of them."" I didn't have that kind of parent, and my grandma was pretty hit-and-miss with stuff. One year for mine, my teacher actually made cupcakes and brought them in for my class because she had a hunch my grandmother wouldn't and I would have been the only second grader who didn't have a recess birthday party that year. So to hear him think that his birthday has to be about Slurrsula too, in *any* way, makes me extra sad, and super angry.

She's also decided to scapegoat my cat and I think threw an empty Gatorade bottle at her. I was not in the kitchen when it happened, and kitty came down the steps in a hurry as the bottle finished rattling and rolling across the tile floor upstairs. 

For the last 3 hours or so, though, it's been intermittent yelling, then sobbing and lamenting to the heavens, ""Just kill me now!!"" and ""I want to DIE! sob sob sob""

It's, like, nearly impossible not to yell into the kitchen, ""Just do it already, jezus!"" Lack of sleep completely ruins my ability to human, and I miss the ocean pretty bad these days, but I'm not taking that bait. 

I need more sunlight, but since this is north and fall time, it's going away, and cold enough that I'm not outside a super lot anyway. 

The cats are getting along. I sent a short video to OH of them playing together and I hope it didn't make his night worse. 

I think this most recent round of self-pity and attention seeking was triggered by finding out one of the neighbors is buying the place we rent and hiking the rent. We already pay 70% of the expenses, which *thankfully* Slurrsula realized we weren't going to take 100% of in spite of her evil friend's whispering in her ear about. And just when that gets settled, BAM, 35% rent increase. 

And no guarantee the things that need fixed in the house will be addressed, of course, but that's renting for you. 

I'm just, like, really angry right now. Really, really, *really* angry. She's huge, though, and I'm not a big person, so I don't think a fight would go well. I have to just stay out of her way. 

I feel like a mouse, down here in the basement, hoping to go unseen and unheard and just live in peace unnoticed entirely. I don't like that this fucking piece of shit addict cunt gets to make me feel small, even though I know it's temporary. I worked so hard to get over that shit and I'm right on the edge of it again."
34,"I’m currently pregnant with my second child, biologically my fiancé’s first but we’re raising my son together. His family has always held my son and I at arms distance and now my due date is 2 months away and I still don’t feel embraced. I’m having a lot of other feelings about how involved they think they’ll be with our baby after not building enough of a relationship with our son but I digress....

None of our friends or family offered to throw a baby shower for us, which at the end of the day is fine I’ve been gathering things for our baby since I found out I was pregnant but still a little disappointing. My MIL mentioned a few months back about putting something small together with just family but nothing ever happened.

We found out last night that they’re having a ‘grandparents shower’, apparently with their friends and coworkers where they keep the gifts at their home. They haven’t bought one thing for our baby and haven’t been super involved in my pregnancy and I feel so betrayed that my pregnancy is being used as something to make themselves look good. I wasn’t even aware this sort of shower was a thing, after some googling it looks like indeed it is...just tacky. 
I feel like my pregnancy is being made about someone else and i am so sick about it.

I would never ask my fiancé to cut off contact completely but at this point I’m not sure how to proceed with them (he’s very upset as well). 
I’m not sure why they have the idea they will need a stockpile of things at their home for the baby since realistically they won’t be babysitting much (we work opposite shifts and they’ve only babysat our oldest child once). 

I’ve been crying over this (also extra emotional since I am very pregnant) and am just not sure how to proceed."
35,"Hi, I'm in need of a reality check. Me and my SO live about a 4 hour train ride away from my parents. I don't see her a lot (every 3-6 months) but I do enjoy it when she comes over. I invited her again to help a little with the cleaning (I have depression and anxiety issues and she always offers to help clean and it sort of 'resets' our house and it helps a lot) and also to just have fun together because lately I've been managing my issues pretty well so we could actually do something fun together, something she wants to do as well.


When we first started planning I said we greatly prefer if she can come over on workdays, because my SO works Mon-Fri and if she takes up the entire weekend, he just doesn't relax. She can be incredibly draining for LOTS of reasons (she's hard to communicate with and she speaks VERY loudly, meanwhile my SO and I speak at a normal volume and are pretty quiet people so the difference is very clear) 
But, even if like our best friend ever came over for an entire weekend: it would be the same, you just don't relax the same when there's a guest in your house. It doesn't matter to me as I don't work currently, but I totally understand his reasoning for preferring workdays. 


So I said that, we prefer workdays (she also doesn't work at the moment so it's not a big deal). That's point A.

Point B, when we finally settled on 2.5 fitting workdays (Come Monday, go away Wednesday), I asked when she would like to leave on Wednesday. I specifically phrased it this way because I don't mind if she leaves in the morning or in the evening, I either get a little more rest or I enjoy her a little more, it's win-win for me. I just wanted to know so I can plan dinner (is she cooking for us? Do we have to cook for three? Can we cook our usual for Wednesday? etc) and just to KNOW. I'd like to know. 

Well she completely blew up about that. Saying she feels like she has to make an appointment to meet with her own daughter, that she has to give specific times (I know she hates that so I specifically DID NOT ask for times, just if she wanted to leave morning or evening) and that she always feels like we don't want her there, we want her to leave as soon as possible, we have a schedule she has to adjust to, etc etc.... She said that if I wanted to come over, I could come whenever I want, and leave whenever I want (not entirely true by the way, because when I go there, I go for 1-2 days, as short as possible, as it's so draining on me, and then I get comments on how short I'm staying, and how loooovely it would be if I stayed longer!!)


My theory is that she's so obsessed with being a bad mom, she thinks we secretly hate her and want to get rid of her ASAP. She's projecting all that fear onto every question I ask (ie: do you want to leave morning or evening?) 

Sorry this got so long, I tried to keep it as short as possible but it's hard to do so without giving context/history. 

But the **TL;DR** is: is it weird to want to know when your mom leaves when they stay for 2-3 days? My mom thinks its absurd and has trouble accepting my SO and I have limited mental energy."
36,"Good news, everyone! I took some advice from here and talked to both DH and MIL and this is the result. 

We had a daycation to a nearby small city where we spent the entire day without MIL. It was perfect. We got to eat someplace new and did a little shopping. We didn’t have to worry about the dogs because my sister came over to watch them. I don’t like going too far from home due to health issues so it was perfect. 

We talked to her about possibly going home a bit sooner than she planned and she agreed to go home the first week of March if her house is done. I will make sure that she tries her absolute hardest to get it done and doesn’t procrastinate. 

The smoking in the house has stopped. MIL had DH help her make a little smoking area in the backyard with a butt collecter, some chairs and a bench. She goes out there to smoke and once in a while DH and I will go out with her to keep her company. I only go if the wind is strong enough to blow the smoke away from me. 

DH has stopped staying in the kitchen with her all the time and will come to the living room with me to hang out. We kind of decided that 1/3-1/2 of his time home he should spend with her and the rest with me alone as long as she’s living here. 

DH finally understood how I felt after a long talk and we’re back to normal. His spine is finally back to shining, slowly but surely. 

The junk food in the house has slowed down substantially. She still might bring us an ice cream sandwich or like a candy bar home but that’s fine. We told her we didn’t want packages of junk food but stuff like that didn’t matter once in a while. 

I feel like I have my husband back and my house mostly back."
37,"Said yes to the dress this weekend and was happy, so I posted on Facebook and Instagram the classic photo holding the sign with my friends and my mom, and getting congratulations from the rest of my friends/family. It happened that my two sisters weren’t even able to be there, so it was already a little bitter sweet I had even found the dress without them.

FMIL supposedly doesn’t go on FB regularly (even though she has been out of work and posts multiple times a day), so supposedly she found out from a friend (none of whom follow me on FB) that I had picked out a dress. She “accidentally” texted my fiancé saying that if she said anything to us about it she’d rain on our parade. Proceeds to call him, hysterically crying, saying that she’s “not naive” at what other mothers are involved with for weddings, she wants to be part of things so we need to stop leaving her out and that she wants to throw me a bridal shower (which typically mother of the bride handles this, but I’ve said I don’t really want one)in her town (all of my friends and family live over 2 hours away) so her friends can come. 

There’s always a reason for her becoming unhinged and taking it out on us. This time it’s because she’s lost her job and she had just bought a new car that day. So she starts laying on the guilt trip about how bad everything is for her and how we should feel sorry, even tho she’s the one that just shat all over our happiness. 

How long will it take for the excuses/gaslighting to become apparent to my fiancé? I think he’s coming around to the idea that she is being mentally and emotionally abusive, but where does the relationship between him and his mom go from here? I don’t doubt the relationship with my fiancé, but I really can’t foresee how I will be able to live this way.

*edits: typos

**Update: his mom threatened suicide, again, because he wasn’t answering her texts. And so the cycle begins all over again."
38,"First Disclaimer: While I am VLC with my mother Mama Sanford, I sometimes need to answer the calls and texts, since she is finally sorting out the mess with the line of credit (Another story, I sometimes hinted at it, too tired of it to get it properly together. It has to do with the house that now is not mine but MS's). Please don't be too mad at me.

So the latest first: I was driving to work, after a short stop somewhere, so I knew the way, but it was not my ""normal"" drive. And I have my phone on navigation to avoid any construction works and jams (They are always building something on the route). So I saw MS calling, thought, well, if I take it, I have a excuse why I need to cut it short since I'm driving. (I was on the freeway, it was not too full so calling was not too distracting. I also was fully prepared to ignore her if that gets to distracting)

She started friendly enough, talking about how she had talked with this and that person and all her appointments with the banks. A bit to extensive, but oh well. I told her at the start that I was on my way to work. You have to know, she ALWAYS calls via speaker, any where, any time. Even in busy shopping malls. This time, she was at home, so yay. But my navigation tried to tell me something and she just talked over it. Okay, it wouldn't be important anyway. Or so I thought. She blabbers on and on, and wants me to spell check a letter for her (meaning: rewrite it to make it readable for normal people). I tell her again I can't, but will do so once I arrive, since I'm driving. ""Oh, you are DRIVING? Yea, sure, then let's talk later! Be careful!"" I was positively surprised. She wanted to end the call, without me urging! That nice thought? It lasted 5 seconds. Just after she loudly called on her end for my brother and then my nephew. And I then just heard her tell nephew something about me. And a shriek from nephew (Yea, I love this little guy, and he loves me back, but Please don't while I'm driving?). Mother then started asking ME things about DD and where I am and how things are and everything. Like, you just said a few moments ago you wanted to end the call, why are you blabbering without an end now? Luckily (or not, why is following), I was stopped at an intersection and just ended the call. I was ready to throw the phone in the back if she called again, despite me needing the phone now.

Well, I need the phone now, because I managed to get on the freeway in the wrong direction, and drove 2 exits straight. The navigation talking? Yea, it was trying to tell me to get of at the nearest exit! At that moment, I was pissed. Though I knew I was just angry at the situation and me, and MS probably wasn't at fault. But I really wanted to be pissed at someone. So yes, I was late to work (I was lucky in the jams were gone then, so not too late).

So now BEC from MS, take a sip of coffee and tell me, if I am overreacting: (without coffein for me)

She wanted some contact info of a certain dude from the bank. I only had his info via voice mail and with my app, I saved the sound file. So when she asked and I was working, I just send her the voice mail directly. Now, instead of listening to the message, like I did with her 20 or so voice messages, she asked again next day. I just wrote back that I send it to her already (I could still see it in the history without scrolling!) She asked for again, telling me that she really need that card! I answered that I don't have a card, only the voice mail that I already sent, but here it is again. Her: ""Oh, that was what it was? I didn't listen to it.. Can you send me the number and name?"" Urg, sure. I listened to it again, and send her the 2 lines. Now comes the BEC moment, in her answer (voice messages): 

""Oooh thank you! I am so proud of you! You did so well!"" (I was sitting there, a bit stunned. I would like her to be proud of me, but not for my ability to listen to a simple voice mail - it was quite clear and not jambled - and note down a number!)

And ""\[Asian Name of DD\]!! \[Asian Name of DD\]!! I miss you so! Your Grandma misses you!"" (practically yelling) ""Have your mother send me pictures! I miss you so,  \[Asian Name of DD\]!""

I originally didn't mind her use the Asian name of DD. I gave her the middle name just for that reason. But I donno, I find MS's use of it just, grrr. Now, I refuse to use that name, even when I'm talking to DD in my Mother Tongue. 

Am I overreacting? Oversensitive? I mean, taking the wrong route is clearly my own fault, and answering a call driving was just dumb. But the other stuff?"
39,"Reason she calls is because I had a baby with her son but me and him are not together so now she's trying to be my new bestie when before hand she couldn't care less about me she always gave the cold shoulder..I mean, I know she's trying to control from afar but I just don't pick up. I'm also not bold enough to just tell her buzz off completely.  But I give her hints when he do speak like , right now I'm working nights and weekends and me and your son are not together. To see if she gets the hint to leave me alone. But now she's using my son in order to see him. Ugh. I don't want to see this lady at all. Is there anyway to get her to buzz off ? Geeze. She thinks because she is grandma, that now we can hang out and I can share my son with her or something. That's the last thing I want to do. I'm kind of glad me and her son are not together. Perfect excuse not to come over. But after weeks go by, she is still determined. Oh boy. How do I handle this situation! I feel like she's working behind the scenes scheming with her son because I haven't passed by in a long time to show the baby. Because I don't like you guys ? Obviously. But this whole custody thing has me scared. There's no case involved yet and her son just gives me money on the side. But I feel like this is all gonna blow up one day. Because she keeps calling and I keep pulling back and her son is giving me money on the side but he doesn't force himself to see the baby like she does."
40,"If you’ve read any of my stories you’ll know we have been NC with MIL for a little over a month now (maybe even 2?). We didn’t block her number so we could document any craziness in case we needed to get a no contact order or whatever.  

Since we went nc husband has gotten one text a week, pretty much every week since NC, trying to guilt him into talking to her. It’s not working and she is only pushing him farther away. 

Anyways, today she texted him about how she isn’t going to give her ring to my daughter. The ring in question is traditionally given to the first granddaughter born (and was already promised to my daughter the day she was born) She stated that since she won’t have a relationship with our daughter, which isn’t her choice (she made sure to add that), the ring will instead go to the next granddaughter born instead. She doesn’t feel right giving it to someone that she won’t know. 

She specifically mentioned that the ring would most likely go to my husbands older brother’s daughter (if he ever has one). He just got married in August. The funny thing is that this BIL (her first born and obvious GC) cut off all contact with her for years UNTIL she left FIL. BIL slowly allowed her back in. Well she had also been lying to him about being back together with FIL. So BIL will most likely cut her back out again. 

What pissed me off about her saying that the ring will be given to BIls child is that this specific BIL and my husband do not get along. Mostly because my husband was always the SG and BIL was Mr.Perfect. Husband had given over 10k to MIL and FIL while he was working and living with them (he was 19) paid most of their bills and was still treated like crap. We’ve helped them move numerous times (even while I was pregnant). 

So this text was just her trying to get under husbands skin in numerous ways and to try and get a response. (She didn’t get a response and won’t.) 

But I just want to scream in her face that this is her own doing and my daughter won’t care about some stupid ring from someone she doesn’t effing know. She didn’t even have a relationship with my daughter before we went NC. 



Sorry for full on rambling. 

Is Sonic the hedgehog taken for a nickname on here? Lol this woman has been obsessed with that ring since she found out I was having a girl and has brought it up numerous times in the past. Any name suggestions are welcome. 

I feel like it’s officially time to give MIL a nickname on here.

Edit: So I do really like Smeagol and think it would be kind of perfect. Lol so if it’s not taken then that’s what I want to use.

Edit 2: so I think I’m going to go with Sonic the Hedgehog for MiL. (As long as it’s not taken) It fits her and someone said they think Sméagol was taken, which is for the best because I love LOTR and I don’t want to think of her every time I read the books or watch the movies lol. 

Thanks guys for taking the time to read and comment!"
41,"My childs birthday was on this month. After being disowned for 6 weeks by my in laws shorty after his birth (mainly caused by mil) I have used the grey rock method if I have to speak to my mother in law. She has noticed as I have had changes such as a new job and had new nieces and nephews that she only found out long after they happened.

So for the birthday we travel to my parents house to have a party. This is mainly due to him having cousins on my side of the family only and my home place is a long drive away so we always stay over night if we go. We wouldn't have the space to accommodate everyone over night if we had any party at our house.

My in laws live in the opposite direction so its not something I would ask them to go to. My husband rings his father only but his mother is usually on the call too as they use speaker phone. So when asking if we were doing anything for his birthday my husband didn't mention the party at my parents house. Mainly because he is very forgetful and would genuinely not remember a kids party coming up. Because of this she only found out about the party after it happened so to her I'm sure she thinks she was intentionally not told about it. It was the weekend before his birthday as it fell midweek.

My SIL was due to visit during the birthday week to drop in his present but couldn't come on his birthday as she had a work event. But as soon as MIL found out she wasn't told about the party she arranged for them all to come to our house on his birthday. They never call to our house and FIL works late at night so unusual for him to finish early. I would have told them no but we had done so many birthday things with him at this point it felt like his birthday was already over.

They arrive in with a cake she bought and she tries to make a big deal about it. My son is a toddler. He had no interest in looking at it. And my husband had already bought a tart for their visit. He hates cake. After SIL arrived MIL started dishing out the cake she bought. Everyone declined it but she gave it to them anyway. My son was playing with a toy he got from SIL so didn't want it either. She was insistent everyone eat the cake she gave them. She didn't offer me a slice. I was sitting at the table. She probably knew I would refuse so didn't want to give me the chance. She wrapped up the remaining cake to get people to take it away with them. Again everyone refused it but she insisted. SIL even telling her it was too sweet. At the end of the night she said 'oh I never offered you any cake'. I pointed out that I had so much cake at the birthday party I couldn't eat any more now.

There were a few incidents were something was mentioned about our son, information about his school or food he couldn't eat when a baby but now can and she would say 'I didn't know that'. So I think she might be seeing how much she is being left out of his life.

The best part of the night was when they were leaving and she went around to everyone to give a kiss goodbye. My SILs boyfriend was there and he has a fancy job so she loooooooves him! She gave SIL and the bf a kiss good bye. Then went to my husband next and he grumbled about it like he always does. He tells her not to kiss him goodbye. Then I was next in line and she came over to kiss me goodbye (for SILs boyfriends benefit because she never does this with me). I shot her a don't you bloody touch me look so she had come in near me and then backed off. My extremely unobservant husband noticed it so I am sure it was noted by everyone else too.

I am still smiling about it that she would think I would do fake niceties with her after all she has done. My husband even pointed out days later how odd it was to bring a cake to someone else's house but take it away and give it to everyone else before leaving. So hopefully SILs boyfriend is noticing her unusual ways and wont be hurt by her in the future. 

For now I will continue with avoiding her as much as possible and keep with the grey rock when I do have to be in her company. Next year I will be sure to make plans for us on his birthday so they cant come visit on that day either."
42,"I don’t really have anyone to talk to who gets it right now, so I thought I’d post here. 

My dad is coming overseas for Christmas and I don’t want to spend time with my partners family, they’ve been having a feud and have blamed me for it. After a conflict about his sister forcing him to move out of his house if he wanted to stay with me, his mother told me that she basically wants me to leave the country and accused me of whispering ideas into his ear and changing him.

He thinks that they’re acting out of confusion and love, and got upset with me because Christmas is a tradition and I should try harder. He said he feels exhausted with the drama that I “don’t like his family” but they’ve been going behind my back and saying that they feel uncomfortable around me, and honestly I’ve just felt so unwelcome that what I need right now is some distance. 

Context if you want a longer read: 

I’m from a different country to my partner and we met in his country while I was on a work visa. When my work visa expired, I wanted to leave but my partner wanted to stay because he had a mortgage so I agreed to get a partner visa with him. 

The partner visa process here is strict and complicated and it’s taken us a long time to fulfil the requirements. While the application process takes place, I can’t work and we have to live together. 

My partner and his sister own a house together but my partner was told that I wasn’t allowed to move in because sister had previously been bullied by some former housemates so isn’t comfortable around other people (There’s a lot more going on here but I’m conscious this post could be too long). Sister is also fighting with my partner because (and I’m being as vague as possible here) my partner went on a tv show and “changed”.

Figuring it would only be for a few months before sister and partner sorted out their feud, I agreed to move in with his parents because my partner is still paying his mortgage and bills. (does that sound reasonable?) Unfortunately that proved to be difficult. Partners family’s house is a total mess as they’re renovating and there was hardly any space. Although we all tried to make it work, MIL became increasingly controlling, especially in regards to how I eat.

MIL is a bit bigger than me so it started off as comments like “I eat like a sparrow” and “I’m too skinny” and when I tried to address these comments, she said “I’m a mother. That’s just what mothers do” and “it’s my Jewish heritage”. Not that I have anything to prove but I’m 5’2 and around 50KGs. I run and I’m quite athletic (so is my partner but he’s muscular so he eats a lot). No one is at risk of malnutrition.

Meanwhile, the argument between sister and my partner isn’t getting any better and there’s a lot of talking behind everyone else’s backs, and for those who are already calling it, I was made the scapegoat. And to be fair, after 6 months of being forced to live somewhere that I clearly wasn’t welcome and not being able to afford to be move because partner is paying for his sisters house, I got fed up and suggested that perhaps it wasn’t fair for my partner to subsidise his sisters lifestyle. 

He’s 50% owner of a house and was told that if he wanted to visit, he needed to phone ahead in case sister was not wearing make up when he arrived. My point was that if anyone wanted to live in a house by themselves, they’d have to pay for it. After digging his heels in, partner eventually saw my point and sent his sister an email saying: you’ve had 6 months of me paying for you, moving forward if you want to live there, it’s time to start paying rent. The house has 4 bedrooms, feel free to rent some rooms out to tenants if you have difficulty paying. 

Well, his parents flipped their shit and this suggestion. His mother sat me down and told me point blank that she had told my partner to let me leave the country and accusing me of whispering ideas into my partners head and forcing him to sell his house (??) and that selling the house would be the worst idea in the world because he’d lose money and everything would be a total disaster and the world would end. 

My partner has become a lot more assertive, I wish I could take credit for that but I can’t. I think him going on TV was a huge shake up. People are mean on the internet and if you are in the public eye then they will often message you to tell you exactly what they think of you, especially if it’s negative. This is probably part of the reason he’s started standing up for himself, as well as being previously unhappy and very depressed. I definitely do give him advice about boundaries but I’ve had to build mine from scratch recently too, so I get that it’s his choice and you learn by making mistakes etc. 

We put our collective feet down and decided that if Sister refuses to pay her way then we’ll move back in and she just has to deal with it. She’s passive aggressive and horrid to live with but it’s better than being with MIL. 

Anyway, Sister has decided to sell the house(!!!!) and MIL thinks it’s a wonderful idea and will solve all the problems. 

Except that I don’t feel okay about any of it. I feel as though his family have been unwelcoming and I want to severely limit the time I spend with them. This upsets my partner because “they’re just confused. They’ve never had to deal with him standing up for himself before” and because I’m the first girlfriend (sister, 29, has never had a partner) “They’ve never been in this situation before” and “they’re acting out of love.” 

My dad’s hopefully coming over for Christmas and I just want to spend it with him and one of my friends who’s going through a divorce and so she’s by herself. We’re all the same nationality so we celebrate Christmas the same way. I honestly don’t care how they feel about me at this point. I tried really hard to make it work but it just doesn’t. 

My partners upset. He says he’s sick of the drama and I understand but don’t want to take responsibility for it."
43,"Me [M26] and my GF [25F] of 2.5 years are getting engaged soon.  She is black and I am white. 

My mom was okay with it at first and treated her well.  She did mention ""dont get too serious with her"" on a couple occasions.  She asked if I was okay with being in an interracial relationship and to remember it affected more than just me and to think about my family.

Other than that bit of semi-crazy, she did treat my GF with respect and was very kind to her.  Then, she flipped after a blog post my GF made that mentioned the seriousness of our relationship.  My mom went off on and criticized her for rushing me into being serious and about her being obsessed with married. We had been dating for a year at that point.

From there, my mom began criticizing every post my GF made and the choices she made.  Her reasons why she didnt like her were ever evolving, from stating that my GF was racist because she only hung out with white people (my gf grew up in middle-class suburbia which is inherently white and therefore her friends are) to the way she handled her job (she said my GF would get fired for talking to her manager about improving her work).

It has become consitently worse since then.  She eventually stopped complaining directly to my face after I kept shutting down her complaints, and started being overtly rude to my GF by not engaging with her at all. 

She also talked to my best friend and his wife alone (they were going through my home town and stayed with my mom) and expressed concerns there.   My mom after this talk told me that they had agreed with her and shared concerns as well. I talked to my best friend after that and he said they had defended and stood up for my GF.

The latest move is my younger brother randomly called me up and expressed almost verbatim ""concerns"", even citing events that only my mom and I were a part of.  He repeated without prompting that he was ""coming to me without someone else pushing him to"".  

It was very obvious to me that my mom had sent him to convince me.

I also recently found out she had texted my dad (parents are divorced) to tell him he had to talk to me about my GF as well.

How do I handle this situation?  How can i focus on engagement with my SO and not let this be tainted? How should I talk to my mom about expectations in engagement?

TLDR:
My mom has expressed ""concerns"" that are not from a rational place, often rooted in racial issues. She has lied about what others said about my SO and tried to manipulate my family members into convincing me to break things off.  How do I handle this going into engagement season?

P.S. This is a repost as I deleted the previous post."
44,"So she needs to always be the center of attention.... two examples.... 

1) I officiated my wife’s cousins wedding last weekend, our daughter was a flower girl.   It was a legit logistical nightmare for a really cool couple though.   MIL did not want to drive, but we made her, and she then proceeded to fake almost getting in an accident, and tarnished the thing for everyone.

2) she refuses to go to doctors or the dentist.   Refuses to check to see if her Medicaid is working.   So tonight she texts me asking if we have antibiotics for her abscess tooth.   My wife is deathly (legit) allergic to basically all of them and I’m never sick... so we have none.   She then asked if we still had some left over from the last time the dog was sick.... she wanted to use canine antibiotics rather then going to a doctor or a dentist.   My kid (3) over heard her grandma say “I’ll just die then” on the phone and now is in hysterics.... I’m gonna end up driving this bitch to the ER 3 towns over cuz she refused to go to urgent care when it was open.... in other words she gets all the attention she wants, and I have to take her otherwise my daughter will think I’m letting her grandma die..... 

Truth told I’m not really looking for advice, just wanted to vent before I head to the hospital... thanks Reddit"
45,"So short one: Staples is my mom.  She hates my FH and doesn't know we're enganged because she's ableist.

Figured out why.  GC Brother is in a long distance relationship with a girl on the other side of the world, and has been sending her money to move to the great white and racist north.  He did this before, with a girl he met on a dating site who happened to live in China (turns out she was employed by the company to keep guys paying subscriptions to chat with her), and Staples is certain that this time is going the same as that."
46,"Hello all. The story takes place 25+ years ago. The family has since recovered and all is as well as it could be.

TL;DR Paternal grandmother (JNMIL) is a bad person and gets to die alone while her GC drinks away everything 

My mother, who is not white (important for later), moved from a small town to a major city to pursue her career. At her job, she met a snarky handsome man who was considerably older than her. He was white. They butted heads as they pursued the same career at the same company. Some time later, they decided they were in love, and wanted to get married. That man soon became my father.

My mother was always surprised how little warmth my father had in his heart for his own mother. Mom came from a small but very cordial family and couldn't understand how a giant family (JNMIL of the story was youngest of 12 and all cousins and their parents lived in two neighboring suburbs) could be so cold and distant to one another. As soon as my mom met her JNMIL, all became as clear as day.

You see, my JNMIL came from a hugely narc family. They valued their daughters according to wealth of their husbands. The sons had everything handed to them in terms of family business and the only expectations for them was to do as mama and papa told them. If a daughter in the family married 'down',  her children were been treated as second class citizens. 

My dad came from the 'main' branch of the family but he ended up being a scapegoat while his younger sister was the golden child. My grandpa - dad's dad - was in the military and they had to relocate several times. At one point dad was left behind because dealing with a 12 yrs old boy was too much for my grandmother. They enrolled him into a private military school and didn't see him until it was time for college. 

My father, it seems, never got any kind of actual parenting. As a teen he got into a lot of trouble his parents smoothed out for him and forgot. JNMIL didn't tell my dad his father died until it was time to attend funeral. She stayed away for the sake of her daughter after that. My dad spiraled out of control because he was a teenager in distress. He stayed a teenager in distress even as a career-driven adult. My mother always refused to let his shit slide. He loved her for it.

Anyway, when my mom went to meet her FMIL, the woman loudly demanded my father to explain why he left his previous wife. Who was white. Who hadn't been a part of his life for several years by then. My mom, with her spine of steel, asked my FMIL very loudly if she talked to her son between then and now, because otherwise she would've known already. That day the old witch decided she hated my mother.

She did everything to make sure my dad had a bad opinion about my mom. She whispered into his ear about how manipulative and controlling my mother was. My mom disliked my dad's drinking habit! What a whore! My mom didn't cook him breakfast every morning! She's in it for money! My mom made my dad pay off his debts! She will kill him in his sleep! My dad, to his credit, never gave any consideration to those things. But he craved his mother's love beyond reasonable standards, and that nearly ruined everything.

It all came to a head when in the 90s my mom and dad ran a business together. They were moderately successful and brought in a good amount of money. One year, my mom told my dad she wanted to get married. They did a courthouse wedding with only their friends present. JNMIL disliked that. My mom's parents bought new furniture for their house as my mom let it be known she's pregnant with my sister. JNMIL disliked that. My mom and dad decided they were going to name the kid (my sister) after my maternal great-grandmother. JNMIL hated that with all her being.

Right after my sister was born, my mom got hit by two huge blows. First, she discovered that my dad gave his mother all their earnings for the year because she spun a tale of being old and frail and being unable to care for herself. Two, my dad demanded a paternity test because JNMIL got him convinced my sister wasn't his. She looked too 'not white'.

My mother went nuclear. She had divorce papers in one hand, paternity test (positive to my dad) in another, and dissolution of her assets in the business was already in my father's hands. He got scared. He got scared bad. He knew he fucked up. He immediately went NC with his mother and sister by proxy, and my parents reconciled. 

Six years later, when my mother was pregnant with me, a second child, JNMIL reached out. She was ill and dying. She asked my mom if the second pregnancy was from my dad. My mom didn't answer.

Fast forward another year. JNMIL calls this time. She is in a hospice and wants to see the granddaughters, her only ones, before she goes. Unfortunately for her, I was in a small town 3 hrs away on a plane when that happened - spending summer with my maternal grandparents. My mom decided to take my sister to see JNMIL. My father refused to go.

There, my JNMIL broke down. She kept apologizing to my mom for how she treated her and my dad. She kept offering to give my sister all her jewelry after her death. She offered 4 items of real estate to my sister. My mom asked if I, the younger child, would get anything. Without blinking JNMIL said 'no' because there was no paternity test done on me. My mom declined. She said to JNMIL that her alcoholic daughter should inherit and drink away it all. And then they left.

JNMIL died a week after that, leaving nothing to my dad or my sister. And it all happened as my mother said. My alcoholic aunt went on a year-long bender and died from alcohol poisoning several months later, having sold everything the family had ever owned, including family estate that had been around for 100+ years.

My father never visited graves of his family. He only mourned the family he never got to have.

But hey. Me and my sister are okay, and mom got a peaceful marriage after all that. 

Thanks for reading. Have a great day."
47,"TW: I suppose it falls under self harm and maybe emotional abuse...I don't know.

Growing up with my mom was always walking on eggshells and a lot of throwing under the bus, mostly to get her crazy focused on someone else, and just trying to survive.  Any happy memories from growing up involve only my sibling and the shining moments when my dad was not drunk.  Most of the rest of my memories are JNM yelling/screaming at someone, slamming doors and then her expressinging how concerned she was for one of us 5 minutes later.  It was worse when my sibling and I fought because JNM would start hurting herself, screaming look what you made me do.  This led to the two us staring in horror cause seriously who the fuck does that?  There was another time where it led to almost jumping out of a car on a highway to end a family vacation, seriously wtf.  Any time I was upset, like when she took my college funds, its turned into but I love you and you never treat me as well as your dad and he said you'd side with him in the divorce.  I just thought you should know how hurt, upset I am.  Hell my dad being in the ICU and me not responding to her the right way led to a phone call of I just thought you should know I was in a really serious car accident, no one was hurt but you should know that.  I didn't tell you when it happened because I didn't want you to worry.  She let's her husband get away with being nasty towards me and making snide remarks because I'm a terrible child, who only exists to upset JNM.

I guess that all leads to now where I'm a parent to a 5yr DD who lights up my world.  I've been NC with JNM for almost a year because of a blow up that led to my DD sobbing and begging never to go back there again.  DH and I jumped on that train and peaced outta that one.  JNM is everything I don't want to be as a mom.  I want my fridge to always have food, there were a lot of times growing up where it was empty.  I want my house filled with laughter and fun.  I want my daughter to have awesome memories of her childhood.  I want her, when she gets older, to always feel welcome coming home.  Mostly, I want her to feel and know she's loved.  Some nights though, I hear JNM voice telling me I'm just like her.  She's always insisted I take after her and my views are like hers etc.  In these moments, I'm terrified that the voice is right.  I'm terrified that my DD will have a childhood like mine and it almost makes me feel paralyzed.  Does anyone else with a JNM get this feeling?  Or am I just being paranoid?  I probably should go see a therapist but I struggle to open up to people and talk about these things. DH knows about these fears and he reassures me that I'm nothing like that bat shit crazy woman, his words.  Pardon my rambling, it's snowing and I'm sitting in front of the fireplace thinking and for me that can be bad."
48,"My therapist and I decided to take advantage of my mom's ""do you want to talk"" suggestion and is coming in for a session in just over a week. I am going to tell her not to contact me unless it is an emergency. In preparation, I'm supposed to email my therapist what I plan to say so he is aware and can appropriately steer the discussion. I'm having a really hard time. I'm already so emotionally and physically exhausted that thinking about adding to what I started is overwhelming. I'm deliberately only discussing the last year, if she can't see the wrong in her choices with that, she never will for any other portion of my life. I'm trying to just get through it, but it puts me in such a bad head space. I know it'll be better once I get it over with, but then there's my brothers and all of that. I just need life to pause a few days so I can catch my breath."
49,"So some back story. My in-laws are all a shit show. My MIL got pregnant with my DH at 14, FIL was 18. Got married at the same ages by some parental consent loophole granted under the terms that the child is pregnant. Anyways they had SIL 6 years later (this is important), despite not feeding DH (he has to go to trash cans or relatives to eat) and having to live in a car for awhile while DH was a toddler. MIL and FIL have been on drugs their whole life. DH moved out at 16 after emancipating himself. as they kept taking money from him from a job he’d had since 14. SIL chose to stay. DH was on VLC with MIL after she stole $3k out of his bank account, and VLC with FIL after he ended up in jail again, really only spoke to them bc of SIL. Anyways when SIL was 13 she was dating a 16yo and MIL would take her to his house to go have sex with him bc thats “what normal teens do.” SIL got pregnant (on purpose might I add, she said she was ready for a family, bf just wanted to raw dog it, and ditched when she refused an abortion), had my nephew just after turning 14. She is now 16, is a terrible parent that would rather play on her phone and with her new bf (who she tells her son is his bio dad, and he’s 18) than pay attention to her son, spends her child support on herself instead of her son, and she’s failing high school because she simply can’t be bothered to do her online home-schooling. SIL also now lives with new bf because my MIL thinks that’s okay. MIL and FIL are now NC after we refused to give FIL bail money for being jailed again, and for confronting MIL for being such a shitty mom/grandma and then calling CPS on her for her lack of attention to SIL. Anyways, I’m getting a new car soon, my current one is worthless, but reliable so we were planning on giving it to SIL under conditions like no friends in car, curfew, and has to get a job to pay her own insurance (trying to finally give her rules and make her grow tf up for her son), and that we’d take the car away if she broke a rule. SIL threw a tantrum and ran to MIL. We have MIL blocked on everything, so through SIL’s phone she called to scream at us because how dare we impose rules on her precious child. But MIL doesn’t have the money or credit to put the car in her own name for SIL, and SIL is too young obviously to put the title in her own name. They tried asking DH’s aunt but she refused as well. So SIL called us today saying they were going to put the car in SIL’s bf’s name. To which DH and I said absolutely not, so SIL threw a tantrum saying we were ruining her chances of getting into college (she’s decided she wants to be a nurse technician, but doesn’t seem to get she has to pass high school first), because she needs a car to drive to the campus, because at this point she’s too spoiled and entitled to take the bus, because my MIL sells her food stamps and then buys her whatever she wants if she cries and screams for it. SIL then called me again to tell me that her bf said he’d buy her whatever car she wants (he’s only 18 and a senior in high school so yeah right), as long as she gets a job to help pay for it. She quit her first job on her first day by leaving in the middle of her shift and never going back despite being scheduled, but bf for some reason thinks that wasn’t her fault. At this point DH and I only talk to her so we have access to our nephew, so that he can know us and our house can be open to him if he needs to escape the mess as he gets older. I hate SIL for her entitled, bratty attitude, but at the same time I get that she’s still a child. But she’ll never grow up if someone doesn’t make her. My MIL is a 34 year old adult and should’ve parented her long before she got this bad, and definitely shouldn’t think this behavior or my SIL’s life choices are okay, but yet here we are. She’s still refusing to step up and parent because she claims SIL “is an adult” and can make her own choices with her son. And I just feel so bad for my nephew and helpless as to make sure he gets the upbringing he deserves instead of the one he’s currently getting with them"
50,"I have arranged childcare and we are going paintballing.

I'm going to take that bitch down."
51,"Hey everybody so if you haven't read my previous posts, I finally was able to break away from my JNMother. or as I like to call her Birth Giver. I also have been healing and polishing my spine little by little. 

So today is a big source of anxiety for me because its Birthgivers birthday!

However we are pretty No and Low contact for over a year now. 

So about a year ago literally before I cut off contact, she moved away from her ex. She insisted she was broke and therefore could not afford most things, however shes lied about finances before. She asked if she could use my Netflix account as she had to cancel hers. I agreed, like a dummy. 

Fast forward after the falling out, I thought I had changed the password but her profile was still on the account and my fear kept me from deleting it. It said mom, so I changed it to her actual name, thinking maybe she still has it but I do not want to contact her or open a can of worms. Almost testing if she would say something, as an indirect way to see if she still had access.

I never got any messages. 

However I had forgotten that she had wiped my card from the account when we were still in contact. I basically couldn't afford it and she still wanted to use it so she imputed her card. Why she wouldn't just make her own, is beyond me. 

So the other night, I was fed up of seeing her name whenever I would put Netflix on to go to sleep at night. The last thing you wanna see before going to sleep is your abusers name flash on the screen right?

So I deleted the profile and thought nothing of it. 

This morning, I get a text at 643am .

"" Since you deleted my profile but failed to delete the card that is mine that pays for it, I have canceled the subscription."" 

So whenever I get messages from her my body goes into full panic, I feel like im gonna throw up. Like a trapped animal. 

But I tried to keep my cool and I told my JYSO. Who was confused at how she still had access too. 

So I go to my email before I leave for work, not only had she canceled the subscription, she also changed the password on the account, and the email. 

This was my account I created. So I was livid and I told my JYSO and she was livid too. So I get on the phone with Netflix and basically explain the situation and I DELETE THE WHOLE ACCOUNT..

I wiped everything, profiles, cards, names and signed everybody out. so its gone. 

Now I'm going to make a new one and start fresh. 

I responded to her message. attempting to grey rock as much as possible. "" I deleted the account, since It was my account. Did not know your card was still on it, now it isn't."" 

She replied. "" Thank you.""

My JYSO thinks she doesn't understand what actually happened though and I agree, I think when she gets home later today and is signed out of the account that she might lose it.  

I hate that I feel so anxious, like I could be on the other side of the world and it feels like she could still reach me and hurt me. 

But at the same time I also feel like. Die mad about it? You don't get to just slap your name on it and call it yours, your not allowed to take things from me ever again. I will burn my house down before I will let you live in it. 

I changed passwords on some of my other things, in case as revenge she tries to access them but I usually try to have multiple verification methods so I'm only a tiny bit worried she would try to mess with more of my shit. 

I just feel icky and scared and sad but deleting the whole thing felt good."
52,"Apparently the in-laws are *very disappointed* that I didn’t show up with the kids yesterday on mil’s birthday. No one requested it. They are seeing us later in the week. I sent a happy birthday text and picture, and suggested to husband to call while I made dinner. I thought these things would be enough. Especially since I usually get a happy birthday text and card sometimes on another date. I didn’t realize that doing the same was going to result in grave tidings of disappointment."
53,"Just a nothing post, but wanted to share this win. 

Future D(ear)H has grown a beautiful and shiny spine over the last few years when dealing with his JN parents. 

He was the scapegoat child, they placed very unfair demands and expectations on him over his life whilst GC daughters were treated like... well... The Golden Children. Anyway. 

JNSMIL huffed and puffed and screamed the phone down over the latest imagined transgressions. FDH delivered an almighty telling off and he was not interested in ""dramatic bullshit."" 

She promptly deleted us and my side of the family from the Book of Faces. Her last and only show of ""power.""

Sorry JNSMIL...we don't value our social media following enough to care we're down a friend count. 

Rubbish took itself out."
54,"Hello everyone! I am the guy with the crazy EX-MIL who is facing several charges because she's.. evil. BTW English not my first language so if I make mistakes please let me know. 

Well it is Wednesday and kind commenters told me to speak to my therapist and to see if I could speak to the lawyer of my former brother-in-law, well it is past dinner time here so I am updating you guys. 

First, my therapist: I can start next week! I will see him twice a month (cuz of work etc) and discuss how I can handle this or just to rant and get some new tools to work with. I am happy with this because I can spend time with my research but also focus on my health and take time to write down my thoughts and experiences. I saw one of her flying monkey's in the city where my therapist is located but me dressed in blacks + hoody + umbrella in this nice European autumn rainstorms made it impossible for her to see me.  She did saw my car and waited for 8 minutes (woot dashcams) but left eventually, she left a note but mother nature blew it away. So sad about it =3.   
My therapist will be in contact with the lawyer and things will go through him first, things that might trigger me or make me upset will be read by my therapist and then told to me. Same with questions that he can answer about my treatment and what my ex-mils actions and my ex put me through and how they changed my life. 

Second, the lawyer: He has been helpful and his clerk? Assistant? she's so helpful and clear about things. The case is actually going well and there have been a few sentences put out, though they still keep her locked so she can spend her punishments  consecutively. She has been sentenced for Stalking, Assaulting an Officer, Disturbing the peace and Lying to an officer. There is more down the road, seriously how the F can you even do all those things and not.. stop? Just.. think. Take a breather? No she just went cliff jumping and never stopped jumping. I loved cliff jumping in Wales but seriously she just kept going and going. Too bad we do not do orange here I could have named her Naruto or Ichigo but my husband would be insulted if I named her after them. Do you guys have any questions I can ask the lawyer? I am seeing him friday again. 

Okidoki this was my update, here I have a little story for you guys. My husband picked me up from work and mentioned this to me and couldn't stop laughing. Around four years ago I met my husband, he was one of the physical therapist helping my father, he came to our home and my dad used to tell me to get changed because my pj's were an insult to every fashion designer (flannel) and I shouldn't dress in flannel when people came over, a human shouldn't be wearing flannel like me (pj's, day to day wear, shirts, scarf). I did not know the physical therapist was gay because I don't have a gaydar, I really don't. It only works with people like Jack from Will &amp; Grace. My dad though? He has amazing gaydar, it is like a sonar. Example, when I was a wee teenager Tiziano Ferro came into the music scene, my parents were all: Damn he gay! Everyone said no, years later he came out of the closet and my dad came home with a magazine and threw it at me and kept saying he was right. Well, I liked my husband back then as person not someone to date because he's helping my father and.. do not mix personal life with my dad's health, what if it turned out to be disaster? Well.. year later we were dating my dad was our fanboy and got us together (my niece told him about shipping and he was all: U MY SHIP! SS SANTOS SANTOV, my hubby is slavic and named him Santov). 

Well things were going well, we both happy and content, going out on dates, telling people in our lives, sleepovers etc, meeting the pets and see if the pets liked each other, they did (thankfully). BUT my dad kept inviting him to church and temple with the excuse: FREE FOOD (bitch no I am cooking and taking stuff with me, but go off I guess), my husband couldn't because of work and commitments till 8 months in our relationship when he said yes to Church, Temple and even football matches of brothers, cousins and the lot. You know how hispanics are with football I guess? Loud, goal is screamed for 90 seconds, tears, food, tears, screaming at the tv because they all suddenly telepathic and can send messages to the trainer, just.. loud. My husband loved it! apparently he was like them? What a shock to find out.   


Jesus christ what a long pre-story I am so sorry!   


We arrive at temple with food and stuff for people who need stuff. Our church and temple help people in our community who need stuff, blankets, food, car rides etc, we try to help each other out and pass it forward. Your success can not only benefit yourself but others, if you can help try to do it if you can't and need help ask, we all humans and should help each other out. Well.. Lady Loca my EXMIL was always happy to help she said but she never did anything, she ate food, brought dry af food, gossiped, tell others how to believe in God and how Satan is in every corner. Like.. dude is he locked up or is he everywhere? Alas I will never find out.. She saw my bf and approached him, told him about the temple services, how we're all a big happy community and if he was new and that she was in high standing, almost rabbi level herself. Well this is how the conversation went according to him;   

Him: Yeah I am new here, I got here with my partner and his family, happy to meet you  

Her: Oh you're not jewish?!  

Him: No I am not, I am.. atheist? I don't know never grew up with the church or god in my life  

Her: ÜBER GASP! But that is inhuman!!  

Him: But I can always marry into it no?   

Her: MUCHO GASP! MARRY A MAN?!  

Him: We can get married by law? even in a church 
 
Her: Gay marriage, is that allowed?  

Him: Yeah since the early 2000's, but there is my partner (yells my name), look this is (EX-MIL)  

Her: You're with him? He's the ex of my oldest  

Him: The russian or the rapist?  

Her: WHAT DID YOU SAY!?! DO NOT SHOUT?!  

Him: ... you're shouting  

Her: DONT DISRESPECT ME!! AND HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!   

Him: Russian or Rapist?   

Her: STOP IT!!! (grabs his arm forcefully) I will excommunicate you I am friends with the rabbi!  

Him: I don't go here? So.. good luck?   

Her: THIS IS NOT THE END! I WILL END YOU

After she ran off and began to tell people a bunch of lies and they asked us about it. No he's not Russian, No he's not a Satanist, No he's not a communist, No he's not KGB, No he's not child soldier. Had to tell people yes he's slavic but not Russian, that the slavic region is pretty huge and yes he speaks Spanish so he understood everything you all said. :P That was his introduction to EX-MIL."
55,"Well it’s that time of the year again. My birthday is coming up and I’m dreading it. I’ve always hated my birthday. I was a tomboy growing up and hated dolls, dresses and make up. My family could never accept that I just wasn’t into that stuff. So every birthday they would buy me flowery dresses, dolls and perfume in the hopes I would start acting like a girl. So basically every birthday I would open dozens of presents I hated and be forced to pretend to be happy about it. 

These days I don’t celebrate my birthday. At most I have a nice dinner with DH and get some chocolates. I’ve long since told Dh not to buy me presents. Most of my friends don’t even know when my birthday is. 

Unfortunately, Beelzebaby knows when my birthday is and she spoils it even more by calling over and over until I pick up or block her (I’ve done it a few times). 

Back when DH and I first started dating, she barely acknowledged my birthday. In fact one day Dh and I happened to be at a function that Beelzebaby and Fil were also attending. It was on my birthday. She didn’t say happy birthday once and Dh was so pissed about it that he called her out on it publicly. I was pissed cause I’d rather her ignore it than her make a Beelzebaby scene and try to act like the perfect mother. 

Since then she’s put my birthday on her calendar and been insufferable every year. She would treat me like crap for months, badmouth me to everyone and insult me to my face. But then my birthday would come around and she would call and pretend that I was her best friend. 

She would ignore me for months, exclude me from family gatherings and refuse to be in the same room as me, but when my birthday came around she would shower me with phone calls and messages to tell me how much she loved me. 

Back in 2015, she showed up at my house unannounced with birthday chocolates, insulted my friend (who passed away 2weeks before my birthday) and got offended when I refused to let her in and when Dh asked her to leave. 

The two years after that Dh and I fought because I refused to take her calls. Last year he finally saw it my way and told her not to call. She ended up sending Dh a text: “dear Dh, congratulations on your wife’s birthday. Hope you (singular you) have a great day”. 


This year, who knows?  She hasn’t spoken to me since June, which is a massive win. I’m expecting love bombing since She wants Dh to come for Xmas and he hasn’t decided if he wants to go.  Let’s hope she ignores the birthday."
56,"TRIGGER WARNING: Emotional and Physical Abuse

 I've never really talked about the things that happened when I was a kid, little bits leaked out here and there, but it was always met with ""Oh that sucks, glad she's not my mom!"" by my friends or any SO's. I've been reading so many stories on here and I feel like this is my chance to just spill everything and actually have people understand. I've tagged this advice wanted, because I want to understand why my Mom did the stuff she did and what she was getting out of treating us kids in this way. 

So my Mom is huge about sports and being athletic, she played sports and was good at them, she refereed games, she coached did it all. So all her children did sports.

First sport I played was softball. I must have been like 8-9 little league. I remember enjoying the practices, but I didn't get along with some of my teammates. We're playing a game and I'm playing shortstop my favorite position and one I know well and one of my teammates is annoying me because they are like right next to me and they should be on third base. They keep doing this the entire game and we lose. No big deal we played hard it's our first game. Car ride is silent on the way home. As soon as we got in the house my Mom exploded. Red faced screaming at me for embarrassing her, for being to busy talking to my teammate to be focused on playing the game and that she's going to kill me. I run up the stairs into my room and push the dresser in front of my door. She came up the stairs after me and tried to get in. When she couldn't she started pounding on the door, screaming over and over again that she was going to kill me. My Dad finally showed up and literally had to drag her away from my room. I could hear her fighting him so she could keep trying to get at me. I did not move from my hiding spot in the closet for the rest of the day. I was not signed up for a second season of softball.

I wasn't physically struck that time, actually being hit didn't happen often as I quickly grew bigger than her. It did happen occasionally though. The Bathrobe Incident will be next. I was going to include it this post, but this was way more draining then I thought it was going to be."
57,"Okay so backstory. MIL (53?F) and I (24F) used to be close. A few months before our wedding my husband (27M) was hospitalized and diagnosed with cancer. MIL told everyone in the extended family my husband’s private medical information after specifically being told not too and then when we found out and confronted her but she lied and tried to deny it. I was really mad at her and she called my husband and gave us a weak apology just for show and then never actually apologized to me for what she did or lying to my face. 

In addition she gets offended if we don’t tell her every detail of our personal life. I got sick of all this because I’d like a good relationship with them for my sake but especially my husband. She keeps calling DH and saying she wants to be close to me so I decided to try to address the problem with her so we could all move on. 

So I sent her this message:

My feelings have been hurt. DH and I visit very often, invite you guys over, and talk to you regularly. We tell you a lot of things, more than any other people, but even after sharing a lot of information and visiting frequently I feel it is not appreciated or seen as enough. Just because we keep some things private doesn't mean we don't care about you. Some things we would like to keep between us as a couple and not have other people involved in.

DH has told me a few times that you've said you wanted to get closer to me. I thought about that today and remembered we used to be very close. We would go shopping at Target and get Starbucks together. We would just hang out and talk the two of us. When DH and FIL picked on you I would stand up for you. We would ride in the car together and talk and send each other recipes. We went wedding dress shopping together. That was fun for me, it almost felt like I had a mom.  I trusted you and I was vulnerable and then you let me down. I was reluctant to trust you at first because I don't trust very many people, but I felt after a while that I could tell you anything. The oversharing situation really upset me not only because of the oversharing but because you told me multiple times that you didn't and tried to justify it.  I understand it was an extreme situation for all of us, and people make mistakes, but I would have appreciated a direct acknowledgement of what happened and an apology without justification. It is human nature to put your guard back up when someone does something like that. You know that is why I am upset with you and not as close with you anymore, but you haven't asked me what you can do to regain my trust or fix our relationship.  The boundaries that I've put back up can't just go back down without time and effort to heal our relationship from both of us.


And then she sent me this:

My feelings are hurt too.  Are we really back to March?  I've apologized and have tried to move on but you continue to hold it against me.  I believe that actions speak louder than words.  I've been kind and loving but that doesn't seem to matter.  I've been there when you needed me and I did my best to help make your wedding happy and memorable.  I've tried to be a good friend and mom to you but it doesn't seem to be enough.  It makes me so sad to think the thing you focus on is the ONE mistake I've made in the years I've known you.  I'm not perfect, no one is.  It feels like you're trying to punish me, again and again.  It's time to let it go.  Life's too short to hold grudges.  It has been a challenging year for all of us and I'm ready for a fresh start.

This made me so upset. She’s made tons and tons of mistakes since I’ve known her. She didn’t make my wedding happy and memorable (she tried to get me to cancel important components days before the wedding, photo bombed my first look pictures, told everyone the details of our wedding that was supposed to be a surprise). And I sure as hell have never needed her. I really wanted to fix things with mil but her response hurt my feelings so bad. I don’t like that she told me how to feel and I’m just so furious with this whole thing. I just wanted to have a family that loved me and she always says she cares about me to DH but really she just does because she wants to see DH more.

TLDR: mil lost my trust, I asked her apologize and she blamed everything on me. 

Edit1: typo and adding tldr"
58,"I’ve been with my partner for a while now and we are discussing getting married. I don’t know his family SUPER well as they live abroad (but on our continent...), but I have really liked them when we’ve met. 

His mom in particular I think is lovely but certainly very quirky - a little bit of a hoarder, very superstitious, etc. Because I find all that to be fun and somewhat endearing, I think I’ve brought her a bit more into our lives than she was in my partner’s life before meeting me. Just want to frame this so people know there’s no ill-will here. 

In any event, recently, I walked into the house to find the BF and FMIL arguing bitterly over the phone, which is VERY uncommon. My BF rarely raises his voice. After they hung up he revealed to me....his brother, vis a vis his mother, owes him $60,000. 

Maybe 5 years ago, because of some unexpected health issues in his family, his parents were no longer able to make good on a promise to fund all or part of his brother’s SECOND graduate degree with what they claimed would, over time, be treated like a loan. Never mind that my partner took out all of his own actual student loans to pay for his own graduate program...

In any event, they basically convinced my BF that he needed to loan his parents this money - pretty much all of his savings from years of work - AND not tell his brother. 

His brother is now graduated and has a good job in a VERY low-cost city with respect to living expenses. Still, my BF has never told his brother about this and is not being paid back by either the mother or the brother. My BF also isn’t pressuring his mother for fear she’ll do something “stupid” to repay him. 

He and I are talking about marriage and children, and where we live is very expensive. I already put most of my savings into buying the small condo in which we live together now, and we could certainly use that money in the coming years. That said, we are fine now and my concern really isn’t so much about the money but the seeming disparity in treatment between the sons, the manipulation that led to this situation, and the dishonesty in the whole situation with the brother not being told the truth (which was explained to me to avoid having him make “different” life decisions to repay my BF). 

It just makes me so frustrated that the older brother is basically being shielded from the realities of adult life (loans, repaying loans, etc) while my BF is carrying all this burden that may ultimately adversely impact his / our ability as a unit to make life decisions that are important to him / us (e.g. maybe we have to work different jobs we don’t like to save more money, or delay having kids). 

I am writing this because, I know as a relative newcomer and non-family-member, that I can’t be too pushy about this. But I’m so bothered by it! And we’re spending the holidays with them. 

Any ideas how I should encourage my BF to deal with this with his mother and/or his broader family, or do I just have to ignore it and hope he addresses it to his satisfaction over time? I know he isn’t happy about this, but I feel like he’s spent a lifetime being treated as second rate next to his brother and I don’t know if he is able to advocate for himself with his family...

59,"I’m exhausted and annoyed, I’m gonna word vomit. So I’m sorry for any mistakes and if anything is unclear.


My DD’s birthday is coming up, and man that just crept up on us! We’re trying to plan out her party. There’s been a bit of an aggravation, because my DH changed his mind on where were going to have the party. I wanted it essentially anywhere but our house, because I had ZERO desire to clean, decorate, or really host. DH understood then, he agreed then, buuuut then changed his mind and now it’s here at our house.

So, I have to do all those things now, and I’m forcing him to help more. I’m trying my best to just adapt and not be bitter. I’ve adapted, and I’m doing my best not to murder my DH. However, DH’s decision has created a new problem.

My mom is now anxious as hell and dumping all on me. It’s starting to look like she’s ramping up for a repeat of last year. She’s freaking out because the party’s “set on the wrong day” and she can’t come out and help me clean. Never mind I never asked her to and honestly don’t want her to, she’s gonna because I don’t clean obsessively like she does.

Then she panicked about the food, what were we serving? We should do pizza instead. Where are we gonna order food? Are you sure you don’t want to get pizza? She could order the pizza? WHAT ABOUT DECORATIONS?!

I told her outright we have this handled. I don’t need or want her to clean. We have food in mind and we know how to order it ourselves (we’re goddamn adults, we have the bills to prove it). WE ARE NOT DOING PIZZA. We got this.

Last night my DH put out the invites on the book you put your face on, and my mom near immediately blew up on my phone about the “wrong day” and how there’s too many people, it should just be family and blah blah blah. No mention of pizza that time, but I expect it later.

I told her we wanted everyone we invited to be there, and most of those people are parents of the children DD plays with. I then told her to direct her questions about the party plans and how she can “help” to DH. He started this mess, he can deal with mom’s anxiety with me. So far she’s texted him once, and he politely shut down her offers of help. He also told her that he would prefer it if she came at the time of the party, as opposed to early. I could feel the anxiety twitch and CBF from here.

We’ll see how this turns out, there’s still time between now and the party. Who knows, maybe she’ll chill out since we both told her we’re fine. Lol, couldn’t finish typing that out without giggling.

Stand by, I’m probably going to be back."
60,"We talk but we aren’t close, never have been. We are polar opposites, she’s way too talkative and bossy while I’m quiet and prefer to keep to myself. She’s not a bad person but she tries to control and boss everyone around, she will literally throw commands around without even saying please or thank you. Her children are the same way. For example just the other day my husband’s sister asked him for a ride to school by texting him “Can you take me to school” and when we dropped her off she got out without saying a word. Idk, manners are very important to me. We had kids young and she had her last son at a later age so my son’s uncle/husband’s little brother is only two years older than him and he is such a rude kid. We lived with them for a while while we looked for an apartment and my son learned annoying behavior that thankfully we managed to phase out. Being told “I hate you” by my son hurt, surprisingly. I know he doesn’t know that it’s a “strong phrase” but dang. When he said that to me it took me aback a little lol.

Anyway, I just hate that we can’t have a normal relationship but it’s her fault. I’ve really tried but she likes to make weird jokes/comments like saying my hair looks unbrushed or that I don’t dress up nice enough. One time when my son came home from school he said he was still full from lunch but wanted PB&amp;J. I always cook for him but decided to change it up since it’s not something he asks for often. MIL got mad and asked why I was making him junk and commented on how kids need sustenance/healthy food (this was back when we lived with her) even though the food she makes her kids isn’t healthy at all. Her son has access to candy and junk food and she always makes him chocolate or strawberry milk with his meals but I didn’t say anything. It must be nice to be that delusional, her son is overweight but she’s worrying about my son’s eating habits instead. 

A few days before we moved out she got upset that I took a two hour nap fully knowing I went to work at 4 AM (I wake up before 4 to get ready for work so...) and lashed out at my husband and I. She said we neglect our kids by not spending time with them and by not attending their hygienic needs. And by that she meant that my daughters hair is unkempt but that’s because she will scream bloody murder if you bring a hairbrush or hair tie near her. She’s 3, she will be fine if she has her hair down for a while. It’s never tangled or anything so I don’t know what she meant by that. She proceeded to say that if we still don’t “take care of them” at our new apartment she would go and call CPS and do anything in her power to get them under her care. I think kids in CPS now would love to have us as parents. It was hurtful for her to say that because I do my best to be a good mom to my little ones. Just last week my son’s teacher told me that my son was thriving and was so advanced she wanted him to start reading by December (he’s in Pre-K) and that she could tell we work with him at home. It’s true, I do. They’re very loved and obviously fed and clothed so for her to even mention CPS just hurt me for some reason. I was abused as a child and it’s night and day how much my childhood differs from my own kids’.

She still tries to come over (my husband’s siblings do too) without asking and sometimes I pretend to not be home. I don’t care who you are if you don’t let me know you’re coming over I’m going to assume it’s a random stranger and ignore your knocks. She and my husband apparently had a small talk about how she knows I don’t really like her but will still push herself into our lives because she’s a grandma now and wants to see her grandchildren. I don’t really like them coming over because they’re all so rowdy and loud (I have small sensory issues due to my childhood) so I need everything in my home to be at a quieter level than most. They will come over and raise the TV volume or have loud conversations and I already don’t like their behavior and personalities so it’s a miserable time all around. They live 10 minutes away but we hardly ever go visit because their grandma lives there too and she likes to also gossip and talk about me to her family (that’s another story). I know we can’t avoid them forever but it saddens me knowing we are going to have to spend holidays with them and what not and I don’t know how to navigate it. Any advice? I’m thinking I should just grin and bear it. Oh well."
61,"Hi- second time posting about my super fun FMIL who showed herself to be very JN in the last year.

On mobile so apologies for typos. This is more of a rant than anything else. 

This weekend was the dreaded return of her to visit us in our city. Luckily I planned a lot of introductions of my friends family and we had plans with my FIL’s side of the family as well. I knew she wouldn’t be too crazy or focused on me if I had a lot of other people around but she still managed to get some rude inappropriate comments in which got under my skin.
My fiancé is a chef. Because my fiancé is a chef, he will usually cook for us if we are staying in. I do our laundry, clean our apartment, pay our bills, buy our groceries etc. we also have a small kitchen and there isn’t really room for us be cooking in there together. Because of this my MIL has it in her head that i “don’t cook” which is infuriating, and she loves to ask me every. Time. I. See. Her. How my cooking is coming along (??)
My mother became terminally ill when I was in college, I had to host many holidays and family get togethers on my own with my younger sister, I know how to cook. We tell her this every time and she still asks every time. Why is she not asking her son how is cleaning is coming along (newsflash; it isn’t).
She asks in her super sweet overly sugary way she says everything, so annoying. 
The second was much worse, we were at brunch the final day and it came up I had been to the gym that morning. She asked “how was the gym” which is weird but innocent enough. I told her fine, she asked fiancé if he goes to the gym with me. He laughed and said no he just duets during the week. 
She turns to me and said are you dieting for the wedding? Have you lost weight? Ex f*cking scuse me? 
My wedding is in 7 months. I admittedly of course want to loose 10 pounds like everyone does  but it doesn’t really make sense for me to start intensely dieting until more like the 4/ 5 month mark. My metabolism left the building when I turned 30 so unless I eat no carbs dairy etc not a pound will come off no matter how much I exercise. 
I struggle with body imagine and I was in a very abusive relationship prior to fiancé with someone who constantly criticized my diet and body etc (and I was much thinner then). I’ve struggled to find balance in this so I really don’t appreciate her asking thing, my FFIL, BIL and sister were also at the table admittedly having their own convo and not listening but still how incredibly rude? What is wrong with her? How do I deal?"
62,"I was being nice in the title, I fucking hate my MIL"
63,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. We have been unsuccessful in receiving a restraining order. 

&amp;#x200B;

As most know by now, TPP is my batshit mother. She has strong connections in the legal system within our county back home, and really, the entire state. With that being said, she practically gets away with murder because everybody respects her police officer husband. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I approached preteen years, TPP made it her goal in life to isolate me, and make sure I was alone. She couldn't stand the fact that I didn't come to her for comfort, or as a friend, so her solution was to separate me from anyone who wasn't her. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, as a preteen she'd pull me away from the ""sleepovers"" she blathers on and on about and demand I leave my friends and do a random chore, or go wash my hair IMMEDIATELY and then sit for an hour and a half to let her blow dry it (when I usually air dried). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then of course, there was the ""bogus house arrest"" bullshit at 14, which pretty much guaranteed I spent a lot of time alone in my room, crying. Because if I wasn't going to be with her, she sure as shit wasn't going to let me enjoy life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another time, I broke up with my boyfriend at 17. I went to my aunt (her sister's) house and was with my cousin, who was a best friend of mine. My aunt messaged my mom to let her know I was there and upset and to ask for my dad's number because she wanted me to stay the night. My mother lost her shit. She told me to come to her house right now. Of course that's a big fat NO from me. Then she called my dad and screamed at him to tell him if I didn't go to her house I needed to get my fat ass home. Then she sent two of her police buddies to ""escort me"" home to make sure I went home, ALONE. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I divorced my first husband I'd put her in a time out so her absolute favorite game was to go down to the sheriff's department, file a false charge (for instance, she said I stole my grandmother's checkbook), they'd come arrest me, I'd sit there for 48 hours (the longest they can hold without bail) and magically at 47 hours, the charge would be dropped. She also let it be known to the jailers (still friends of her husband's) that I wasn't to go to population, they ALWAYS put me in holding cells and everybody who came in after me went to population. It was some of the darkest times of my life, being alone with no communication, no way of knowing what was going on, nobody to even speak to except the jailers who'd bring foot around 3 times a day and tell me that I needed to get over my fit and let my sweet mama back in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I had my first child, I spent 3 days in the hospital. From 30 minutes after my operation she launched her tirade, she didn't want my husband staying with me. It was my first child, of course he's staying, it's HIS first child too. No, men don't do that. That's just weird. Your mom is supposed to stay with you. Nope. So then she started pestering nurses to get them to say NOBODY could stay with me, including my husband because if she couldn't, he shouldn't either. I deserved to figure this motherhood thing out by myself since I thought I was such a ""high and mighty"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, if you read her letters, you can see she is bewildered because she can't figure out how to isolate me. She tells me to start staying at home, stop running the roads, but it absolutely kills her that she has zero control to make me be alone. (And she has a hard time doing fake charges these days because of a new sheriff and I also moved far, far away). Even in her emails that she sends these days, she is sure to let me know that ""nobody likes me"", I ""have no friends that aren't online"", and ""I'm all alone in life when my aunt and dad die."" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really figured out what her goal was by isolating me constantly. Maybe it was a thrill for her. Who knows?"
64,"First time poster, long time lurker. Sorry for formatting issues etc. 

Gentle advice on how to proceed as I am not the primary target in this story about my mil. 

Like the rest of you amazing people, my mil has had her good moments and bad moments. A bit of background info is maybe necessary to understand (?) maybe, what it’s like associating with her.  Hubs and I have been together 18 years, married 15. 2 lovely sprogs and a mostly happy home. Mil and fil were super involved when the children were very little, much more distant now (despite living 20 mins down the road). A lot of that has to do with my dropping the rope years ago. Hubs is the forgotten child, older bro is the golden child and his wife and children are also treated the same. 

We believe in fostering a sense of magic and wonder in the world around us, and yes, that means telling the children some fantastical stories as they grew up. For example, I had my 2 convinced I was an alien from outer space, complete with green stained hands (from mowing the lawn). Oops the disguise was wearing off. Green milk in the fridge, was from the night time trip I took to home planet, enjoy it on your shreddies. My youngest loved fairies, we told them that the garden was full of beneficial ones. To this day, they still collect fairy garden houses and items to leave for the fairies eat. Hubs convinced the kids that he was a black-belt karate master and had trained in Japan at a special dojo there. And on and on. Trust me this is important! To this day, the children love reminiscing about those stories and how fun it was to believe in the magic of the worlds we created for them. 

Why would this matter? Well, only because this caused a great deal of anger in mil. She firmly believes that children should not be told lies and that this world-building that we were engaging in was detrimental to the children’s mental and emotional health. She would go out of her way to make sure to tell them that we were lying and that it was all made up. She spent a lot of time insinuating that we were bad parents for lying to our children and making sure to share her opinion with bil and sil. Neither one of whom found it anything other than funny. Yes, we told stories, but never to the point of making our children upset! Remember, it is a source of amusement and entertainment still to this day. Around this time, I finally dropped the rope and stopped. There were a lot of other issues that raised flags for me at this time too and I figured it would be easier to let mil and fil decide on when they wanted to spend time with us. Surprise, surprise, it wasn’t much and to this day still isn’t. I very rarely say no to an invite for my children to spend time with their grandparents, but can say it’s only once every couple months (and usually just before we visit with any of my very just yes family who are all long-distance). 

The cult that mil belonged to doesn’t celebrate any holidays or birthdays. The only significant event celebrated is wedding anniversaries. This is also important. Bil and hubs grew up without Birthday’s, without Halloween, Easter or Christmas. It’s made for some very interesting adjustments over the years, no biggie for me, I adapted when we didn’t have the sprogs, but once they came, it was full on. Bring on the dinners, the joy, the laughter with family. Let’s make some lasting traditions! Mil was always invited and attended but was clearly uneasy with this change in our lives. She would come to birthdays and we truly appreciated her being there. Being a part of our celebrations was important to us and we tried our best to always extend the invite with no pressure on her to attend. 


So having set a bit of the background on mil (who belonged to a religious cult until she was disfellowshipped), we now come to the part that I have been struggling with for months. I am hoping that venting here and gaining some alternate insight into the situation, will help me get through the Christmas holidays. 

Just after Christmas last year, mil was watching bil and sil children. She got into a heated discussion with oldest child (who called mil’s hair funny). Mil took great offence to that statement and retaliated by saying that Santa wasn’t real and that he didn’t bring presents to the children, that it was mom and dad who did. Oldest child then, with all the logic of an 8 year old, replied that if Santa wasn’t real, then neither was god, because they had asked god to help with math homework and god had not helped! Mil then left promptly when sil came home, didn’t say anything about the fight also didn’t speak to GC son and sil for a few weeks. When it did come out, mil did not address anything she had said to the oldest child, but made sure to point out that they had made fun of her hair. It took bil and sil days to get the whole story out of oldest child. Bil called and fought with mil over who had said what but didn’t ask her to keep her opinion about Santa to herself. Sil was furious about the whole thing and asked bil to call and address it again. He did not. It took 3 months before mil would look after their children. At this point it’s all been rug swept and everyone is acting like normal. 

At the same time, we were unaware of the conflict, and invited mil and fil out to celebrate hub’s birthday. They came and in the middle of supper mil stated that Santa wasn’t real to my children. They are aware, we have spoken about the magic of Christmas and keeping the joy alive for our younger cousins, so it wasn’t as big of a shock as she had planned. We also have pointed out many times that mil lacks joy and magic in her life and how boring it must be to look at the world that way. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is what to do when mil brings it up again? She found a news article in the newspaper and mailed it to sil re: the lies parents tell about Santa and how it erodes a child’s confidence in their parents ability to tell the truth. She seems bound and determined to ruin the spirit of Christmas and both bil and sil seem unable to address it effectively. Do I say something to her? It’s not like her and I have much of a relationship. Or do I let it be and hope for the best? 

Gentle advice please!"
65,"I'll explain the people involved and then provide the story. 

So if you've read my older posts you'll know I am a premed and my problem with JNMIL is her baby rabies but my husband and I are CF. 

My sister is married to DH's cousin, and his mom is whom we call Aunt, JNMIL's sister. 

Sorry for long post, FF to the texts if you want, tbh that's the actual meat of the events.

So, last we left off with family chat, it was decided that DH, cousinIL, sister and I are spending Christmas with my JYMom who is paying for all of our tickets to get there, we live several states away so this is essentially costing her 700-1k per person. Well, Aunt has been JNMIL's confidante, but due to JNMIL's behavior, she's gotten sick of it, and the last incident actually caused her to genuinely stop being a mildly JN to my sister and their relationship has improved. Now Aunt is going on a cruise for the holidays (by this I mean Christmas as my culture doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving), her and sister have actually been keeping in touch over this and sister is helping her plan and shop etc. I guess this threw JNMIL in a rage, and in her attempts to ""fix"" things, she started harassing me about going on a cruise with HER for Christmas and just let DH stay with JYFIL (this is going to be a different chapter altogether) and my sister and CIL go to my mom's. The way I said no also requires a different chapter, but let's just say it sent her in a massive post rage-rage at Aunt. Essentially telling her she is fake, she's only doing it because the communists offered to pay for her retirement (my sister also went premed, CIL is an L2 so they're set to make a comfortable living) and that she's letting the chink f\*\*ks win. Aunt found my response funny so she wasn't the least bit upset about JNMIL going off like this, she did get upset over how unhinged JNMIL has gotten and thinks she's entering senility, dementia runs in the family and she thinks JNMIL is showing signs of this. I can't really say for sure since I haven't had any prolonged time spent with her in the last three years, but it's not my direct problem right now. Mostly I'm writing this because I can't believe the bipolarism displayed. I wish we could post screenshots because it would be easier, but I think I kind of want outside commentary because I don't want whatever I or my sister says to just become ""those pReMeD chinks think they can diagnose everything because they're pReMeD"" yes that's something she has said about a different illness we thought she might have. 

So the texts to Aunt are as follows:

JN: she \[me\] doesn't want to go on a cruise with me for xmas, idk what I'm doing wrong

Aunt: you made racist comments and expected them to waste their mother's money to see you on a day she hardly gets off, you know what you did, please stop acting like this

JN: OH IT'S MY FAULT THEN, EVERYTHING ALWAYS IS THEY JUST ROPED YOU IN WITH THEIR MONEY THOSE COMMUNIST F\*\*KS BOUGHT YOU HUH? MUST BE NICE TO RETIRE SO CUSHY I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ABANDON YOUR OWN FOR SOME YELLOW JUNGLE MONKEYS

Aunt: That's enough, that's my son's wife, MY DIL you're talking about, regardless of how difficult it is to get along as a family, the best thing to do is try to fix it, but you're not trying to fix it properly, you're trying to order the kids around and that's not going to work

JN: I'm their mother they should listen to me, don't they teach them that shit over there? What's the point of oriental bullsh\*\* if it doesn't apply to all mothers

Aunt: It does, their mother is a NURSE that hasn't gotten Christmas off in several years, a holiday that is so important in their culture. You just host a dinner and send everyone home. 

JN: Oh some Filipino nurse f\*\*k pays and everyone goes? How stereotypical. So the kids will only come if the parents pay? Those are some weird Asian family laws!

Aunt: That's not how that works, stop. This conversation is over \[JNMIL actual name\]. I am not doing this with you. 

I believe, according to sister, this is where she blocked the text messaging option.

This is where Aunt spills to sister that essentially no one is coming to her dinner this year. BIL and SIL has gotten upset that she spilled the beans on their pregnancy (from my first(?) post) and they decided they weren't going to travel anyway because of the pregnancy. JYFIL is wanting to spend Christmas week with HIS mom who is pushing 98, JNMIL doesn't want to go to that because she wants HER holiday. And since JYFIL won't be there, his kids from his first marriage will be doing the holidays ONLY with THEIR mom instead of splitting. I ALMOST felt bad when I was told all of this, but that was before I was sent the screenshots. Aunt is having a talk with CIL and sister now, but sister basically said they've been told to just not engage with JNMIL anywhere. Aunt said she chose to show the texts to them because she doesn't want any hearsay since she herself is trying to really step up as an MIL, but she's sorry about the words being said about us. 

It's been an interesting morning to say the least. I'm incredibly exhausted over this, it really is emotionally draining to see that NC hasn't even made a difference with her. I am just grateful this happened AFTER midterms otherwise, I feel like I would have been so upset at her racist words that was said, not even about my sister, but my mother. I get that it's kind of a stereotype, but my mother is an incredibly intelligent woman, she's not just the typical immigrant that came here from the rice fields. She worked hard in our home country, yes doing field work, but also educating herself. She was a commercial accountant back home, and she went to nursing here because of the schedule it allowed her to have while raising 3 kids as a truly single parent. HER dream was to be a doctor, and she honestly can be, short of taking the MCAT, she's a BSN-RN with a 3.8 GPA upon graduation, if she wanted to take the premed prereqs, I have no doubts she could get in. My heart was so angry and in so much pain over that. 

Sorry for the long post, my husband was already at work when sister called to chat so I don't really have anywhere to sort out my feelings. Once he gets home we'll end up talking about it, but I feel like if I didn't get this out first, I would end up just cheaply insulting JNMIL and I want a constructive conversation, not just a fuckMILfest. I'm almost in tears because after we hung up, I went to call my mom, she didn't answer and when I sent her a text to say I love you, her autoresponse was her ""I'm so sorry, I worked night shift and I'm on silent, I'll reply when I can!"" auto message that she was so excited to have learned how to set up. Ugh. Everything is just kind of piling on and making me more emotional."
66,"I’ve posted here before about my MIL who is genuinely a good person but is a total arse about interrupting people and always having to give advice. 

I’m an immigrant to Brazil and have been very lonely and depressed for the 2 years I’ve been here. I’m in therapy and on medication to work through my issues. I’ve been deeply unhappy since moving here and am trying my best to create a life for myself. 

DH and I don’t necessarily want biological children. I’m 32 and he’s 31 and whilst we still have time to have children we are very keen on adopting a child at some point. This is our decision and we’re on the same page. 

My MIL has full baby rabies though and I can’t say anything to her without her bringing it back to the fact she doesn’t have grandchildren yet (DH is the oldest of three and we’ve been together for 12 years). We’re trying to adopt a dog and when I sent her the picture she just wrote back: “have a baby instead! A male friend told me to do that once”. 

Wtf?

Then when I reminded her that we want to adopt (she knows this) she said: “try the other way first!”

I’m worried I’m overreacting but I can’t help feeling like I’m a walking womb and reduced to the sum of my reproductive parts and what I want doesn’t matter. 

My DH was abandoned early to fend for himself, was bullied and criticised his whole life and his coping mechanism is to ignore her. I can’t though. 

Please be kind although I realise this isn’t the most extreme MIL around but I’m quite upset.

Edit:

You’ve all been incredibly kind and I really appreciate it. I’m starting to question whether she is actually a nice person following her abandonment of my husband. Thank you for opening my eyes. You’re all lovely x"
67,"*on mobile*

Background: so I'm the one with the MIL who told her son to take a sabbatical from the family, he did, she commences trying to rug sweep like a champ for 8 months. At DH's birthday he went from NC to VLC while we are keeping me NC. DH had the ""talk"" with the IL's after the birthday lunch and set the boundaries he wanted respected for communication to restart and one of them was I was being kept away from the family.

Present: So DH and I just came back from a two week vaca. On said Vaca I did a JustNo moment for which this Community pointed it out and I apologized and backed off (deleted post because it went from (JustNoMIL to JustNoFamily). DH was appreciative of my apology and we went about vacation as planned. Well gifts were bought for MiL/SFIL. When we landed  DH was allowing SFIL to pick us up (wasn't thrilled, knew this was going to open a door). Needless to say, DH spilled that we had goodies and that HE would be over at the house in the next day or two to drop them off.

Next day I get the text message ""awkward"". ""Why"" I asked. Turns out MIL expects me to be over at the house with DH. Epic facepalm. I straight up asked DH  ""Does she not remember the part where I am being kept away?"" ""Evidently not"" is his response. Well he has to reschedule because turns out one of the SIL's are staying over that night. At least MIL let DH know before he went over there.

So rescheduled night happens. I get the low down today. All boundaries were respected. No sibling talk. No holiday talk. No birthday talk. No baby talk. Awesome! Didn't see it happening, but super glad it did. BUT....of course there is a but.....""they kept wanting me to order food to bring to you.""

Again ""Are they unable to grasp what 'OP is being kept away' means??""
DH""I think they are trying for a clean slate. You know, your rugsweeping phrase.""
OP""I'm fine with a clean slate, they need to say it though.""
DH""Agreed, they need to say that's what they want.""

So evidently MIL can respect all of the boundaries that will keep her baby boy talking to her, but she can't be adult and open her mouth and say ""Hey, let's start over."" So glad my holidays are locked in place."
68,"Might be helpful to read my other posts about mil. 
All of a sudden mil has decided to invite my mom to visit when we visit them, they live a few hours away so it's a ""trip"". 
My question is why now, because after all these years she rarely invites my mother, only a holiday that she knew I wanted to include my mother in but other than that she's pretty exclusive unless its forced on her, like my mother being around so she gets invited to dinner outting etc... Mil and Fil have even visited DH and I, we live in same town as my mom and she's not even extended the invite to her. So this invitation for a weekend trip is soo out of character for her. But there have been issues between us recently and I think it's related. She asked DH and I if she can invite my mother. Instinctually I think no because it doesn't work for us logistically.
But wondering if I should say yes, because maybe it's a positive thing?"
69,"So Last post I talked about my mother and her abuse well. My stepmom is a hell of a doozy. She can be JY at time but she has been mostly a JN lately. She is the type of posh rich person that I totally hate being around. Her family (nieces and nephews) makes fun of my sister who is special needs. They come from a very well off family. When I first met her she was nice enough and then as time went on she had her good and bad moments. She is mainly a JN. She owns a business and basically talks trash about people in her profession.

Today I got a bunch of text messages from her berating me for making the wrong choices because I didn't send a text saying Happy Birthday to my dad.

**The problem:** My dad told me to stop contacting him because I was causing ""unnecessary stress on his life"" and that I could start contacting him again when/if I started to pay him back. I decided that I didn't want to add stress to my dad's life that I would not text him after sitting on possibly sending a text. I decided not to after i re-read his email. I didn't text him for Canadian Thanksgiving. I wanted to obey his wishes.

Well the text messages went on about how I am a horrible daughter and I am still not making the right choices. She also went on to say what if you need more money in the future to which I replied with a highlighted version of the email saying that my dad did not want me to contact him until I started making payments(car payments and for the rent money that I borrowed.)  I also added that my living arrangements were none of their concern and if I end up evicted that I will deal with being homeless. I stated that I did not want to break the rules that were laid out for me and I am still being belittled.

Payments are a bit hard right now because money is tight from being so sick this past year. Due to me not wishing my dad a happy birthday it has apparently reaffirmed that I am a horrible person and not an adult who makes horrible decisions.  I will find a way to make things work. I will hitchhike back to the USA if I have to and get a job there. Sure I may not have a car(sold it when I moved to Canada) or a place to stay but I can camp out somewhere.

I put in an application to switch visa status. It isn't like I am doing nothing. I am trying to do everything.

I have turned off WhatsApp notifications but any advice is appreciated.

Should I just block them all? I don't want to go NC because of my sister. I am sad, frustrated because I can never do anything right and I feel like an utter failure. I didn't plan on getting sick. I did not want any of this to happen. I have been in a high anxiety state all day. I am trying to prevent myself from having a panic attack.

70,"Going anonymous for this since posting this from my regular account would surely dox me. 

My husband and I have a 6 month old, our first and likely only child. Our son is my in-laws’ 5th grandchild (my husband has 2 older siblings with 2 kids each between the ages of 4 - 10 years old). 

Since our baby was born, we have seen my in-laws about a dozen times. They came over to see the baby in the first few days we were home from the hospital, and we’ve either had them over or met up with them for a few hours every few weeks or so. I feel like this has been adequate, I like them well enough but we’ve never been super close and my husband and I are doing great just doing our thing and being our own little family. 

So, my MIL’s birthday is coming up and she wanted to celebrate it on the actual day. One of my best friends happens to be visiting from out of state that weekend and we have plans to see her that day, and we told MIL it would just be too much for our LO to be out and about for most of the day and then go out to dinner for MIL’s birthday too. We told her we’d be happy to take her out on another day, just not that day. 

She acted like she understood at first, but then called me husband yesterday (I guess after stewing for a few days) and told him we are being overprotective, she feels like we don’t like her, and that we “make all these rules everyone else has to follow” and if she doesn’t follow them we will cut her off like I did with my parents (my parents are crazy abusive and I am now NC with them after many many years of trying to fix/repair a relationship that is beyond broken). Her other hangup (besides the birthday thing) is that we didn’t want to go to a park on the other side of town to take photos with the entire extended family when our kid was ~5 weeks old. Instead we took the photos with everyone in a place that was much more  convenient for everyone - she has the family picture that was such a big deal to her, but we just didn’t go to the damn park that she wanted. My husband rightly told her that she’s out of line, and that we’re sorry but we have prior commitments with someone who is also important to us on her birthday and that we aren’t going to drag our 6-month-old around exhausted just to please everyone in the same day. I don’t think he even acknowledge her “you wouldn’t go to the park I wanted” complaint because it’s ridiculous. 

I’m pretty pissed. Like I said, I feel like we have had a pretty good thing going with my in-laws and I’m kind of shocked she just blatantly went behind my back to talk to my husband like that. I swear there have only been these two instances where we’ve said “no, sorry, we’re not going to do the exact thing you’re proposing” since we had our son. And after having four other grandchildren, I expected her to understand that as new parents we are going to occasionally make decisions that are not always all about her. My husband agrees with me and thinks she needs to shut up and get over herself."
71,"TW: Physical abuse. Verbal abuse. Foul language. Long post TL:DR at bottom.

This is starting in the middle and while I have a ton of stories I could share, this moment became the defining one in my life and the catalyst for the changes I made. Currently VVVLC as I now live over 1000 miles away from her.

My JNMom is a huge narc and makes huge productions of showing people just how awesome she is.  Years ago I nicknamed her 'Bun-zilla' as she's so adamant about being referred to her childhood nickname.

So back in 2003, I was 31 at the time, Bun-zilla decided she wanted take my family (my 4 children, my self and my then JNSO) on a vacation to an island directly off the east coast. Ex didn't want to go so she offered to let us bring a friend or 2 if we wanted since my JYUncle and JYAunt were going to be staying adjacent from us in their own bungalow and she was ""going to be spending most of her time with them"". It was decided that we would bring my oldest daughters BF and her mom who I was also decent friends with.

We all made the decision to drive with Bun-zilla asking if she could just drive down with me and she would drive my SUV for most of the way so I wouldn't have to. Now Bun-zilla has a habit of talking so much that she gets distracted from the road so I told her, ""Thanks but you're paying for the rental. You relax and I'll drive."" Thinking that was settled I went about packing everything up.

It comes time to leave, I go out to my SUV and there is Bun-zilla sitting in the drivers seat. The argument that would have taken place wasn't worth it and I figured I'd take over after the first stop so off we go!

She started berating me even before we hit the highway. According to her I was acting ungrateful and should be happy she wanted to drive...I didn't pack for my kids right, my SUV needed to be cleaned, and a hundred other different complaints each one punctuated with her finger pointing in my face as she drove. My heart sunk because I knew this behavior from her. I just kept my mouth shut and let her continue. Then came the moment where she took her eyes off the road to scream at me that I wasn't listening to her. She starts coasting into the left lane where a huge semi was. Literally just inches from a collision. I tell ""Look out!"" Horns start blaring, she jerks the wheel back and just floors it. My kids are crying in the back and I tell her to pull over. She refuses and then starts blaming me for her bad driving..and my spine started shining. First stop and I take my keys from her hand and tell her she's done driving my vehicle. This infuriates her but I don't care. I point to my kids tear streaked faces and say ""tough shit"". When she started berating me again I told her that I was driving now and needed to concentrate. She didn't say much for the rest of 7 hour drive unless it was some passive aggressive snarky comment which I ignored.

Finally we reached our destination. She seemed in a much better mood so let the vacationing begin...right? Wrong. The week that ensued was a constant battle of her trying to control everything we all did even when she was with my Aunt and Uncle or her completely ignoring us except to tell my kids what a bad mother I was for not doing ""this or that"" even at one point telling my kids that aunt and uncle didn't want to hang out with us because I couldn't control them right....whatever. ( In the meantime she told Aunt and Uncle that I wasn't planning on bringing the kids to see them because, "" She doesn't agree with you guys being Christians."") Wait...what? We were born and raised Roman Catholic. I didn't find that out till later.

Last day...while planning the route for the return trip home I was trying to avoid the constant construction on I95 north, so my friend and I had the road atlas out and came up with an alternative route when she walks up behind us, grabs the atlas and hits me in the head with it. ""We're taking 95!"" She's screaming at me. ""You don't know what the fuck you are doing! You're such a stupid bitch and you and this bitch (she points to my friend) ruined my whole vacation! I hate you!""  She stomps away and I'm holding back tears. My friend just hugged me and said ""Let's go home."" Nodding I got myself back under control and went to go finish packing. After awhile I'm calm and was laughing cause my friend was a hoot and doing everything she could to help lighten things. We're all outside packing up the vehicles, I'm standing in front of my open driver's side door when I hear Bun-zilla screeching at the top of her lungs. I made to turn around and look but before I could move she was on me, punching me in the back of my head and shoving me into the open door. She grabbed the back of my hair and literally was trying to bash my head against the door jam. I could hear my kids screaming...again, and guys...I lost it. The realization that my kids were watching their mother getting attacked broke me. At the time I was a blue belt in Tae Kwon Do and I ended up kicking the crap out of her. I was furious as she knew I didn't allow violence around my kids because of the upbringing I had with her and JNSF. (She was divorced from him by then). 

I left her there, hundreds of miles from home. I had had enough and was never going to take her shit ever again!

Remember that Roman Catholic upbringing tho? 
 
On the return to home I called and made an appt with my therapist.  The guilt I was feeling! OMG I hit my own mother! 

My therapist, after listening and tearing up herself, says to me, "" KatatonikOne, you have the right to defend and protect yourself no matter who it is attacking you.""

Whoa. That one small statement really did blow me away. It was the exact opposite of all I had been taught and lived. And that is how I shined my spine and started changing the course of my life. Thanks for reading."
72,"Hello again! 

On mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. 

I’m now 35.5 weeks pregnant and my JNM has full on baby rabies and is driving me absolutely insane. I can really use some advise on to to handle her. 

My JNM is absolutely crazy. I’m sure she has some undiagnosed psychological disorder. She’s called the cops on my SO twice and on me once since I’ve been married (6+ years now). She claims that I “ran away from home” and am being held captive and have Stockholm syndrome and am being held against my will. She can’t get it threw her thick head that I don’t want to be around an unstable person who’s made my life a living hell and I want no part of her and I sure as hell don’t want her near my LO’s. 

LO1 has an immune disorder (IGG1) and often gets sick and gets rounds of immunotherapy and anabiotic therapy. So he cannot be around sick people at all. He will end up in the hospital. 24hrs after he was born LO apparently caused her so much emotional and physical distress that she couldn’t help out with him (or me) since he “hurt her back” so much and caused her crippling head aches. But then would call and bitch at me that she wasn’t allowed to see him. So to preserve my own sanity I went NC with her for a year. She would come banging at the door and acting crazy for months and for hours at a time. (More info on previous post) 

Anyways, I have terrible pregnancies. I’m in and out of the hospital due to morning sickness, epilepsy, and clotting. So between me and LO were at the drs office most of the week and don’t really like to be bothered on our days off. Next week we have 8 appointments in 3 days. One of them is at a specialty hospital 3hrs away. So no I DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH CRAZY AND HER ISSUES. She is just getting over shingles and STILL shedding the virus and is blowing up my phone wanting to see LO1 who currently has strep and me. HELL NO IM NOT PUTTING MY UNBORN CHILDS LIFE IN DANGER OR MY LO1 TO  SATISFY YOUR CRAZY NEED TO BE IN MY BUSINESS!

I keep explaining this to her and she just keeps pushing saying her dr said it should be fine by the weekend. And why can’t she come see us. 1. You’re STILL SICK. 2. My LO1 is sick and don’t feel like having him hospitalized for 3 weeks cause of you. And 3. I need to actully rest and not deal with other people dramas. 

The closer I get to my due date the crazier she gets. We’re not even planning on telling her LO2 is here until we are home to avoid the drama she put us threw with LO1. (But let’s face it, it’s probably going to be worse) she’s not allowed to be alone with LO1 or to take him to her house. She says it’s all my SO faults that we are not “close” anymore. (More like I’m so out of the fog I don’t even want to be in the same country as you). 

Today she sends me another line of text and calls while we’re at a drs appointment demanding that I call her once she’s out of work. And I just do t feel like dealing with her anymore. Her way of “solving” problems is to try to buy our love with crap or money. And we keep telling her we DO NOT need anything from her that LO1 doesn’t need anything and the more crap she brings over the more stressful our lives get cause there’s just no room in our house for extra crap. 

So I would really like some advise on how to handle JNM and her inability to leave us alone."
73,"Hi all,

I(26F) and my DF(34M) got asked by my father last month if he could move in to find a job in our area. We agreed on the basis that when my mum comes to visit it's never for long and he deals with her. All was agreed. Or so I thought.

So to get on with the JNM side of things she came up on Sunday. A week earlier than scheduled. Me and my partner complained but my dad said she was missing him. We then got told she is staying till Monday, Which brings me to the reason I am posting.

She has now asked that she stay till the 10th November due to her having no money till then. Being unhappy about this I called my father and partner in for a chat to say under no circumstances was she to stay. My dad now has put the guilt trip on saying he's only got £59 till his job starts in two weeks and mum has nothing. My partner has decided to let her stay but it just puts us in financial difficulty.

She constantly talks down to me,barks orders at everyone to do things for her and not once has she bothered to clean up after her four dogs. I have a dog myself but it's ridiculous I'm still expected to do the whole garden,cooking,cleaning and everything else whilst she does the bare minimum. My father will help a bit but he's not the best.

I have physical disabilities and suffer with PTSD. Having her here is making things worse. I'm not sure if I'm being bitchy because of the way she has treated me and I'm overreacting or if she is taking the biscuit. 

Oh and little bonus for you. My mum decided to bring up a top that she no longer fits in and gifted it to me. She's a size 22 and I am a 12......

I apologize if I've rambled but I just don't know what to do anymore."
74,"Getting so sick of giving absent MiL and FiL my headspace. Long time reader and commenter on a throwaway account.

My kindergartener’s birthday was a few weeks ago. My parents sent a present that they okayed with us ahead of time and even a token for the 3 year old in case they got jealous. Also coordinated facetime to say happy birthday and watch present opening. They call often and make an effort to visit from another time zone and be involved. MiL and FiL put in no effort at all. Half the time they answer FaceTime if DH calls. They comment and share my Facebook photos gushing and fawning.  Have never attempted to visit. Ignored both children’s baptisms, and births got one like-farming Facebook post each, no visits or gifts or cards or even a phone call outside the one my DH made to inform them of the news. Can’t remember when their birthdays are or how old they are. Had one time we visited their area and extended the trip by one day so they could go to the zoo with the kids but they skipped it and a few days later posted Facebook pics of an outing with the ggc that lives in their house. 

MiL especially has started with the baby rabies and it makes me want to throw things every time I hear she starts. She likes to get drunk or high and call all of her children and tell them to call GC’s wife and tell her to get pregnant already.  Putting aside that we would never torture SIL like that, they obviously either doesn’t want or can’t have kids and it’s none of our fucking business either way, I don’t understand why she thinks we would ever help.  She has at least one grandchild by every other one of her (more than a handful) of children.  They completely ignore all of them but two ggcs.  Why does she want more grandchildren to ignore?  Or is she just going to throw away one of the current ggcs?  It can’t even be some old fashioned gender thing, we have one of each and the first/only of one gender, the one that’s very rare in their family, and they don’t give a shit anyway.

A few months ago we got blasted with texts demanding a phone call to a ggc for their birthday. Calls at least, presents suggested. My kid’s birthday doesn’t even get a text, and over two weeks later it’s gone without acknowledgement. I’ve avoided posting pics on Facebook because I just can’t deal with the anger and disappointment. I almost lost it when my sister’s husband’s parents posted a happy birthday Facebook message to my child. These people aren’t even my inlaws, they’re my sister’s, and they care more than DH’s parents even though they live halfway across the country and have only seen our kids I think twice on our rare visits to hometown.  Why can’t his parents be halfway decent, or at least fair and ignore all their grandchildren equally?

I’m just ranting here, I know the answer is care less.  We’ve already dropped the rope as much as we can and if we find we’re making effort we stop as soon as we realize.  We don’t call them anymore, trips to their area aren’t planned around them at all (DH’s job usually takes him to an office about 30 min away from their house twice a year, although for the planned future he’s switched to another office in the opposite direction). We live six hours away. NC seems unnecessary as we already have such little contact.  I’ve restricted them from most of my Facebook and I’m in the process of tapering off the kid pics they can see so it can just fade out of contact as well.  I know the kids are reaching the age they can start talking to their cousins and they’ll soon realize that the ggcs are spoiled brats who like to horde toys and will not hesitate to boast and try to bring my kids down because it’s what they’ve learned from family. From what I understand of the family dynamic MiL and FiL were both the SGs, so I don’t know if they think this abuse is how families work or they’re reveling in finally having power. I just want to not think about it anymore, but I can’t get over wanting better for my kids."
75,"DH and I have been together for 3 years, married for 1. He has a 5 year old with a previous relationship and I have two others with a previous relationship. We have a 6mo old together. MIL always compares me to his ex and says things that truly hurt my feelings. We live states away  from his family so I always try to send pictures and updates about the kids. It was a mutual decision to move to my hometown because it’s a lot cheaper than his, but she said I “brainwashed” him into moving. They wouldn’t even come to our wedding. Anyways, MIL NEVER responds to me unless she’s bringing up DH ex or their child together. I send pictures and the response I get, if I even get one, is “I saw DD today. So cute. I missed her.” or “Ex came by today with DD. We had coffee and a wonderful time while DD played!”

Umm okay? I try to be the bigger person and just ignore it and keep trying to let her be a part of our life, but it’s honestly just becoming tiresome at this point and I don’t know how much more I can take. DH just tells me that she loves me, but she has a funny way of showing it and just to ignore it. I just don’t know what to do anymore and we’re going for up for Christmas. Help me. lol

ETA: His ex won’t allow me around their child together because she’s still bitter that they broke up. Break up was mutual because neither of them were happy. As soon as we got married she flipped out. MIL takes her side and says that DH needs to keep me out of his child’s life too, because it’s not “my place”."
76,"As the title says, my 50 year old MIL has asked me to be her surrogate!

Husband and I have been married for 3 months, we have  spoken about having a child of our own but have put it off since we’re only 23 

MIL has asked me to be her surrogate and idk how to react 

Husband is saying it’d be a wonderful thing to do but it just feels weird to me carrying my husbands brother?

I haven’t told her yes or no and I don’t want to ruin my friendship  with her - what if I bond with the baby and decide to keep it (which is legal) then I’d raise my husbands or ex husbands brother, weird?"
77,"Received a text message today from an unknown number (paraphrased)

""Hi unicorndogsfordays, your GM gave me your name and number. I am so and so. I went to (school you went too) and (place GM worked). Now I live (insert my town name). It's a great place...""  Proceeds to go on about qualities of place. 

I love 2.5 hours away from this woman for a reason.  Text to my father ""please ask your mother to refrain from giving my number out to strangers 🙄"".

Probably just BEC but damn it's annoying as hell.

Edit to clarify: it's some woman she knows that I don't know and it's her attempt to be ""helpful"" since I have no family out here. Like she can build me a support network is what I am assuming."
78,"It took me and DH longer than we wanted to be able to sit down and talk. We have completely opposite work schedules, so this wasn't him dragging his feet. He returned back to his usual self within a few days of FF leaving, as always happens. When we finally talked, i got an actual apology (acknowledging his wrongdoings, sincere remorse, wanting to find a way to prevent it from happening again, etc.). He let me vent and discuss all the rules i want in place. He agreed with them all. Even before we got to talk, DH said that she has to get a hotel next time and he doesn't know how her staying with us ever started (i can't remember either).  

Some of the rules were basic, FF gets a hotel, she absolutely does not boss our kids around, DH has to be the one to shut her down if she's rude or breaks rules, FF never goes to work with DH ever, they don't go off alone, etc. Oh and all phone calls will be on speakerphone with both of us present (as it was supposed to be). I asked for a timeout, but wasn't sure how DH would feel about that. He surprisingly agreed, so i asked him what time amount he wanted (i was hoping for 6 months but thought that might be too big of a step for him). 6 months was the first thing out of his mouth. I made sure, so no birthdays, no christmas, no thanksgiving? He said nope, 6 months. Hell yeah! Now, he's agreeing to everything, apologizing, and listening to me and participating in the discussion. But what happens when/if we see her again? I really tried to dig in his brain. I asked him why he broke every promise he made to me regarding FF. Why he decided that letting her have her way was better than making her respect us. What was he afraid of, what is the worst thing she would do if he told her no? Would she cry or have a tantrum or scream or what. Why was not making her even slightly uncomfortable more important that allowing me and the kids to feel safe and secure. Why were her feelings more important than ours, or the promises he made me, or my ability to trust him. He had no answers. Like, he just can't figure out why he feels like he has to do whatever FF wants. I tried asking him about how she was during his childhood again, and i thiiiink he greyrocked me. At this point it's up to a therapist. There's something there that i just can't break through. He acknowledges that her behavior is abnormal, that their relationship is not normal, but he just shuts down when i ask questions. Now that i have a job and we have more income, i will work on trying to find a therapist in this therapist-barren city, or save up a bit to get online therapy (like Betterhelp, which people have recommended). Online might work better, since the only day we both have off together is sunday.  

So when FF left that weekend, she left as soon as she realized DH wasn't coming back home till evening. She left me a super sappy love bomb note, on the dining room table. No one goes in the dining room, except the kids. That's where their laptop is set up. I think she wanted DH to see it before i did. She's left me notes before, in the kitchen, where i spend most of my time. I think i'm just being resentful here, but her note was all ""thanks for having me visit, i had a great time, wish i could've taken you shopping, i know your schedule's hectic, i know you take care of EVERYBODY."" Yeah i bet she had a great visit as she had me and DH arguing the whole time. Why the emphasis on how i take care of everybody? Oh, and my schedule's hectic? She's always insisted that i'm lazy, every single fucking phone call she asks DH if i've gotten a job yet (i wasn't working while the kids were young, as me and DH wanted, the oldest just now started middle school). This visit, FF never said a single thing about me working now. Never asked how my job was or acknowledged that i had one. I guess it doesn't matter to her since she has nothing to complain about now. Oh yeah, FF also (i feel intentionally) left things here. She texted DH asking about some book she left. Couldn't find it, but i found a sweater she left that she had to have soaked in at least an entire bottle of her perfume. So we sealed that in a bag b/c it reeked. I finally found her book, in DD's room. It appears she threw it into the far corner. There's no other way a book could end up in that position from a suitcase sitting on DD's bed. FF wanted us to save them for when she came back to visit. DH agreed we could mail them back to her. So we did. DH didn't even answer her text, we just mailed it.  

I blocked FF on DH's phone till we could talk. He was fine with it, said it would be better to not have to deal with her till we had a chance to talk about things. I'm assuming she had been trying to call or text him, b/c last week she texted me thanking me for mailing her belongings and saying she wanted to visit again, everything being said in a sweet kind way (faaaake!). When DH won't answer her, she always texts me. I never responded, and DH is fine with that. I told him i'm done, i'll not be responding to her or answering her calls, i'm just done. After we talked, we unblocked her number, and so far thankfully nothing. Ok, it is just bizarre to me how little DH wants to do with FF when she's not around. He was like, she can stay blocked, i don't mind. But the second she's here, he's all whatever mommy wants mommy must get. Sorry, it's just driving me slightly insane trying to figure that dynamic out. So for now, the saga of Forgetful Flo should be put on hold till May, after the 6 month time out. I'm sure post christmas will bring some bullshit (she always wants to visit after xmas, to give us our after xmas sale presents, and before that there's DH's birthday, we'll see). But gods willing, by May, we'll have had couples counseling, and DH will have individual therapy (cuz i really think that whole mess of emotional incest needs undone). And if he wants FF to visit again, it should be a very different type of visit.  

Alright so the Teflon update (check the bot for background, cuz it's too much to tldr). At some point last spring, she sent yet another card, but the contents were different. She wanted to try meeting again, like we did last fall, and wanted to apologize to DH. Ok, so i showed DH and left it up to him. He was the one seriously wronged here. He said we could try again, but only if Teflon acknowledged that how the company, including her and her brother, treated him was wrong. So we met up again. Again it was small talk at first, but I went for it. I said if there was ever going to be a relationship with all of us again, she had to acknowledge what was wrong, to accept responsibility. And she did. It was awkward and uncomfortable, but she did it. I was not quite happy with it, but DH thought it was sufficient. I've left every decision up to him, regarding our interactions with my parents. We are taking it slow. We all go out to eat with them like once a month (they always want to pay, so DH decided we should always tip, and tip well). We started talking to them right towards the end of the school year, so we invited them to the kids graduation/awards ceremony things. Sometimes when the kids have a random day off of school me and the kids will go meet my mother for lunch. One of those times DD asked Teflon if she could spend the night. I wasn't close but i could hear, and she told DD she wasn't sure, it might not be a good time, and she should ask me first. Ok, so that was the right thing to do. So i let DD spend the night a few days later. DD's spent the night maybe 6 times since then, a few times when her cousin was there so they could play together. DS has spent the night twice (i always left it up to the kids and DH). Teflon has NEVER asked to have the kids on a saturday night (meaning they would have to go to church the next morning). One time DD spent the night Teflon needed to go into work with DD, but made sure to tell me in advance and tell me that uncle was out of town, so i would know DD wouldn't have to see uncle. So far, Teflon has adhered to the boundaries, and not really pushed. There was a small push, she asked me if the kids wanted to go to VBS, but when i ignored she never said another word. Other than that, in regards to us and the kids, everything has been good on that front. It's still a new, different, stiff, sort of awkward relationship, but we're all holding up our ends of the agreement.  

And apparently christmas cancer was real cancer. Teflon did have breast cancer, chemo and radiation. She has lost her hair, had some sort of pump thing in her neck/collarbone area, and will be taking pills (that have to do with something with radiation stuff, idk) for a whole year. I do feel bad for that and i'm sorry she had to go through it all. She was told last month that it's not a genetic type cancer, so that's good for me and the kids. She has been given a good diagnosis and they think it's all gone, just these meds for a year to make sure it's completely eradicated. As bad as cancer can be, it appears she got off ""easy."" Chemo was gross and exhausting, losing your hair as a woman sucks a lot, radiation isn't a picnic, but the cancer was caught early so the treatments were shorter and not as aggressive. Ugh so now i feel bad for thinking her cancer diagnosis was fake and quite coincidental. I do however think in the beginning she tried to play it up to be bigger than it was. On the other hand, i don't know how i'd act if i got told i had cancer.  

And then there's the shit with my grandparents. My cousin lives with them, and Teflon and her siblings are absolutely losing their minds over it. They have tried so many things to force him to move out. I think it's good that my grandparents, in their 80's, have an able bodied person around to help them. My grandpa, who was working every single day till last spring, started going downhill real fast. Mostly physically. They say mentally too, but i think it's his hearing aids not working right. So there were a few more things about a nursing home, and then they saw that grandma wasn't budging. Teflon used to go on and on about this stuff, but recently with me, she hasn't brought it up. And from what grandma is telling me, it now seems to be just aunt (Teflon's sister) that still tries to force it. Teflon stopped trying to bitch about cousin to me too, so that's good. She's also never tried to guilt me into doing family things where uncle will be present. My sister actually just invited us to niece's birthday with the assurance that uncle and gf will not be there, and that she will keep checking to make sure they won't be and inform us if something's changed. So at least my family has accepted our boundaries and is respecting them. For now. I won't be letting my guard down. Forgetful Flo taught me that lesson."
79,"The background details are in my previous post, but the short version is my MIL tricked my daughter into eating meat a few days ago. DH texted her yesterday to let her know DD wants me to take her trick or treating instead of MIL like we initially planned. I guess this got it through to MIL what a massive betrayal it was and she actually felt genuine remorse. She said she was going to talk to DD and apologize. We were very relieved because we worried it would be like pulling teeth to get her to see that what she did was awful.

My daughter just got home from school screaming ""GRANDMA GOT ME A PUPPY!!!"" Turns out that my MIL went to a pet store and bought a Pomeranian puppy to try to make it up the her. After texting her a sincere apology, she sent her a picture of the puppy.

I have no idea what to do. To be fair to MIL, we said we decided to get a second dog that would mostly be for DD. I'm sure her motivation was genuinely to do something nice for her and she probably thought she was helping us by paying for a dog so we didn't have to.

However, this is NOT what we wanted for a second dog. First of all, my husband was militant that he didn't want a Pomeranian when I considered one for our first dog, so he is going to be livid. For our second, we wanted a medium-to-large dog from either a reputable breeder or a shelter. The fact it's from a pet store garuntees the dog is from a puppy mill or backyard breeder, which means a high likelihood of health problems. It also feels incredibly manipulative that she got the dog and sent DD a pic before asking if it was alright. Am I jumping to conclusions for thinking she intentionally did that so I couldn't tell her 'no' without my daughter thinking I'm Satan? I also question if she texted her while she was at school so that there was no risk of me seeing it before her.

I feel like we have no choice but to keep the dog, or else my daughter's heart will completely break. I have no idea how my husband is going to react, though. He's at work and I won't be able to discuss this with him four hours. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps talking about how excited she is about the dog and I don't know how to respond other than feigning enthusiasm for her sake.

I'm very worried my husband will insist we can't keep the dog and I have no idea what to do if that's the case. On one hand, I want to respect him, but I also don't want to crush my daughter. Would I be in the wrong if I pushed to keep the dog? I'm a SAH mom, so between me and DD it's not like he'd have to care for it at all. He would just have to exist around it. And I'd like to think he would warm up to it after some time.

Also, I don't know what to say to MIL at all.

Any advice on how to handle this is very much appreciated.

UPDATE: Husband and I discussed it and we will not be keeping the dog. He talked to his mother and apparently she cannot return it, so she is going to keep it. We told DD that grandma is keeping the Pom and we will be taking her to a shelter next weekend to pick whichever dog she wants as long as it gets along with the one we already have. She did not seem the least bit disappointed as it means two new dogs in her life, so at least there's that silver lining to the situation. DH and I are now in the process of figuring out the appropriate consequences for his mother and plan on having a very serious discussion with her within the next few days. I will let the sub know how that goes. Thank you so much everyone for your advice!"
80,"This is quite long, but I really need advice.
 
 
So, my husband and I got married in May of 2018 after 15 years of knowing each other and 4 years of being a couple. In all that time I've always thought I had a good relationship with his parents, nothing special but OK.  
 
A bit of backstory (it'll become relevant later): my mom died from cancer in September od 2018 and I'm still having a hard time dealing with it, but the first few months were the worst. Around December 2018 my town was having a Christmas event (advent) and M &amp; FIL came and we showed them around. I started crying from missing my mom so much that I couldn't control myself. We used to go to the same places (it was our tradition), and the thought that I'll never be able to do that again with her, talk to her was just too much. Eventually I went home because I couldn't stop crying and was embarrassing myself in front of everybody.
    


Well, a few month after we were married, my husband told me his parents think I hate them. I was shocked and really had no idea why they thought that. He said it's because of the way my face looks when I'm with them - disinterested and bored.  
  I do admit I do get bored. It's a problem for me in general, especially because I have a 'resting-bitch-face' and have been told on a number of occasions that I look annoyed and disgruntled when I'm just feeling normal. But I've never had anyone saying they thought I hated them. 
I really didn't want them to think I hated them so I took this feedback and tried my best to not look bored (try to join the conversation more, smile etc). I can't say I was always successful (sometimes they talk about people or things I know absolutely nothing about and can't contribute) but I did try.
 

  Anyway, a few months later, the situation escalated. My husband missed a call from his mom (he was with a friend having a beer) and received a text message from her saying:  
MIL: ""Is she not allowing you to talk to your own mother?!""   
HB: ""What?""  
MIL: ""She took everything from me and she doesn't even deserve you, I hate her"".  
He was furious with her and told her to stop with this crazy conspiracy theories and to not get pissed if he doesn't pick up the phone every single time. A few days later he went over by their place and everything was just way, way worse. His father kept coming up with various ""evidence"" that proved I hate them and that I am a stuck up bitch. Some of those were:

*  my face (again);
* that I didn't want to the eat food they make (I do eat it, but not every little bit in the pot like I used to. I'm fat and want to loose weight);
* and of course, my bailing on them last December.  

He listened to his father and gave reasons for every single one of his ""proofs"". In the end he told them they are heartless and that they disappointed him greatly.  
  The next day his dad called and apologized but his mom just portrayed the whole ordeal as ""the dads fault"" and does not recognize her part in all this.  I'm extremely hurt by their words, but especially by her saying she hates me and then not even acknowledging it. This was in August, and I haven't seen them since, but November 1st is coming up (we are planing on visiting them and going to the graves of relatives, as is custom) and I'm dreading talking to them. Every bad thing they said about me was said to my husband and not to me directly and I'm pretty sure they think he hasn't told me. But given that I do know what they said, I feel sad, hurt and in part disgusted and don't know how to act when I do see them.
 
Any advice? Also, Am I wrong with feeling this way? Is the dads apology enough and I'm just being idiotic?"
81,"My MIL is by far the biggest narcissist I’ve dealt with in my life. She was verbally and mentally  abusive to my husband when he was growing up. After we had our first daughter she wanted to have this close relationship with us as if we had just forgotten all the psycho shit she had done, for a little while we went along with it but still didn’t really want to , she is EXTREMELY manipulative, and can find a way to play the victim in almost any situation, so it can be hard to find a way to get out of her grasps. After we had our second daughter we noticed that she always favored our first born. If our first born is around when any of her other grandchildren are around our daughter will get supreme treatment while the other children get yelled at and punished for ridiculous things. When my younger daughter was just 5 months old my MIL left her sleeping FACEDOWN in her carseat while she went outside to play with my older daughter. After that I stopped letting either child go over there. Since last thanksgiving both me and my husband have stopped communicating with her. I wanted to just cut the ties and not have to say anything because I know she will over dramafy the situation and make herself out to be such a victim, but she has been bombarding us with messages asking why we won’t reply to her. She has recently started harassing my sister in-law with questions on why we don’t talk to her. She will post messages to my husbands Facebook wall saying we need to talk to her, and send me text messages saying that there is something “urgent” or “reaaaallly important” and she “NEEDS” my husband to talk to her. I am so sick of the constant harassment. My husband could go a lifetime with just ignoring her but I want something to be done and said to get her off my fucking back. I’d like to tell her that her parenting of my husband has resulted in the consequence of him/us not wanting to talk to her. Even though that’s just one of the many reasons why we don’t care to have a relationship with her. I just don’t want to deal with all the drama and victimization that will come with me telling her the truth. I’m not sure what to do because I feel like my husband should be the one to say something cuz it’s his mother but he’s not the type to want to get involved in any sort of drama whatsoever. I feel like if it goes any longer then one day I might explode on her. Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
82,"Haven’t posted about my mom in a while because she’s been following my set boundaries, but I guess that changed. I just woke up for work and saw a text saying “I know it’s last minute but Wanna have dinner tonight?”  She has been weirdly insistent about having dinner with just me so that I can talk to her ‘in person’ and assured me nothing is wrong, but I just can’t shake the feeling she’s trying to ambush me with something. I told her my schedule and that I was able to have dinner with her if she followed my schedule, and was mentally prepared for seeing her next week. Someone please give me the strength to say I told her my schedule and tonight doesn’t work for me. I don’t want to have dinner with her tonight because my work week is extremely stressful due to an upcoming school event, and my partner will be home tonight and I want to have dinner with her rather than my mother. 

She’s been texting me a bit and it’s been bugging me-with the new Apple update and the ability to make animojis that look like you, she has nitpicked everything I did to my own animoji (mostly that it wasn’t feminine enough and looked like a man), and I’m feeling myself panic and try to please her again. Help.

EDIT: she said ‘ok no problem’. I don’t feel any better about it but I guess it worked."
83,"I don’t want this to be a novel, so I’m not going to get into too many specifics here. Just know that my FMIL is insanely manipulative and controlling (like spying on bank accounts and harassing him about decisions she disagrees with in front of others so he’ll back down out of embarrassment). I was raised in an incredibly dysfunctional family, as every side of my family had its own destructive tendencies, so I’m well acquainted with dysfunctional patterns. I pointed these out to my SO when it started to get bad (good god the shit I’ve been through in the last year, she pulled her BS in a hospital while SO was having surgery and I was the only one there to defend him as she tried to overthrow all his decisions), and his therapist and I teamed up (nothing illegal, we’ve never met) to pull him out of the FOG. It worked, he can now see the manipulation his parents throw at him and no longer wants to speak to them until they prove they understand what needs to change and make an effort. We are moving across the country in a few months, which they do not know. It’s all going great, right?

The only issue now is how afraid I am. I always promised myself when I got away from my own shitty family that I wouldn’t end up back in this situation. Now I’m in it willingly and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m 14 again and waiting for another blow up that ends in a police visit or a street fight (yeah, we were the ‘fight outside for all the neighbors to hear’ people), and it’s taking a toll. Especially when I know the fireworks are coming whenever she and FFIL find out about the move (which SO seems certain will get to her through her various FMs). After knowing her this long and seeing what she does whenever things aren’t perfectly under her control, I’m certain this is going to be a big display. I know this has been handled as best it can for the time being, and we’re leaving so soon, but I can’t let go of the terror for what happens next. I haven’t told him this part, but I’m also terrified that he’ll believe the BS again and go running back and I’ll either have to leave him or get stuck in another dysfunctional situation. How do I let go of this fear? He’s grieving for the loss of the relationship as well as having to let go of the idea of the relationship he thought he had before he was shown what was really happening. He needs a type of support that my deep fears about being in another terrible family are making it hard to give.

I’m sure others here have been in a position where their SO has finally cut contact and they’re still terrified for what she’ll do next. How do I put these fears to rest so I can help him through losing his relationship with his parents?"
84,"See last post on MIL delima.

update on MIL.  She actually messaged me saying ""miss you"" and when can I see you and DH&amp; LO..so I thought now's the perfect time to say a little something.. so I responded with "" thanks I needed that, sometimes it's hard when people just focus on LO"". She responded back with "" we want to see all of you..but I understand every mother goes through that. The baby becomes center of attention because they change so quickly""

So, how would you guys take this?"
85,"Long time lurker first time poster. For some context, I am a 23F senior in college due to graduate next spring with a Computer Science degree, I’ve lived at home throughout college as I couldn’t afford to move away. I’m a Christian and most everyone in my immediate family are too but religiousness rarely is an issue but that does happen from time to time and I have been diagnosed with ADHD as a child and cope with it (important for backstory). My mom ranges from Just Yes to Just Maybe normally, until she looses her temper. Yesterday she lost her temper.

Early yesterday morning (around 7:00) I realized before starting to make myself breakfast and lunch to take to school I couldn’t find my car keys. Normally I’ll put them in my shoes but I didn’t see them there so I spent my hour after getting dressed looking for them. Not finding them by 8:00 and needing to leave in about ten minutes I decided to grab the spare set to my car from my mom’s nightstand and let her know. Granted my mom was working from home and about to start a meeting so I told her really quick just to let her know saying something to the effect: “Mom I can’t find my keys so I’m using the spare and will come straight home to look after class.”
Cue the shouting from her... over car keys that were in the house. I don’t remember the exact words but it was to the effect of “SERIOUSLY!! TAKE THE SPARE BUT DON’T LOOSE THEM AND YOU FIND YOUR KEYS!!” With the tone being as if I had accidentally injured her dogs or fed them chocolate 🙄🙄. The only response I have to her yelling is that the keys are somewhere in the house, letting her yell till she is done

Side note: My mom has this habit with her actions to portray animals, tv shows, work, or things as more important than family. Just a contributing factor to why this has effected me but not the main focus.

Mom finishes her yelling and I tell her “I’m going to class.” And leave for my 45 minute commute to school, on the way up I call my JYDad who lives a cross the country and even though it was 6:30 am where he lives he took my call and I tell him what happened. My parents are divorced (for about 10 years) and my mom is remarried but my dad is still on the pulse for my mom’s thought process. The two main points my dad had were 1) that her anger was not about the keys (which I asked about later) and 2) the incident was not my fault. Another thing dad called is that Mom won’t apologize unless she feels guilty about her actions, lo and behold 10 minutes from my destination she calls me and apologizes for yelling. I don’t accept it at the apology just saying “ok.” A little petty but the moment I say “I forgive you.” Or accept the apology the matter is closed to my mom.

One thing that she said during this call that I hated was “I’m sorry I started your day off bad yada yada.” I control if my day is bad or not not my mother. I parked and listened to show-tunes going into class. After my classes I head home and search for my keys my mom and younger sister chilling in the backyard with the two dogs. Mom apologizes again, I say ok or walk away and look for the keys. After I find them I go out to talk with her. (Which by the way half asleep NeoWarrior dropped them into her backpack after staying up late writing an essay.) 

The conversation went like this:

M: I apologize NeoWarrior

Neo: ok... I have a question why were you so angry about keys?

M: *Gives me the look of someone who is about to explain something simple for the hundredth time* I was upset about the pattern you have of losing your keys and you leaving them on the counter all the time. You made your sister late for work the last time.

Neo: I locked myself out I knew where the keys were (and I don’t point out that my sister would have been late any way)

M: I count it you also lost your keys in Walmart (two years ago). I’ve apologized and I should have handled it better... I want a behavior change (Funny I want that two with the temper loosing) 

Knowing I would have started a worse argument I left it at that and said “I forgive you.” And dropped the subject with the plan that next time she tries to yell at me over something inconsequential I’m gonna tell her “I’m not going to discuss this with you if you’re yelling at me.” And leave to go somewhere for a few hours. The reason is this is a cycle with us is that I forget something or make a small mistake and things that stress out mom outside of my control blow up at me (almost never my sister cause they are alike). 

I’m done with being a punching bag. I am planning on not getting involved with partners who have the same reaction to conflict and if my mom continues to blow up at me I’m keeping her away from any future children I have. I don’t want to have to bandage the emotional hurts of my kids that I have had, I don’t want them to think “Grandma isn’t proud of me.” Or “doesn’t love me more than...” because she can’t listen or has blown up at them. I’ve had enough of that.

I know this issue isn’t resolved as the next blow up could happen anywhere from 2 weeks from now to years from now. I’m putting this up as a reminder as FOG does creep up from time to time. Thanks for reading."
86,"So my fiance and I have been together for five years now, but it hasn't been easy. This will be a long one but I want to get it off my chest and to be told that is this abuse, as sometimes I get into fits where I blame myself for everything.

I was known for being a loner, so when I told my parents I had a boyfriend they were elated. They wanted to know who he is, meet him, and when they did they were so nice to him and supportive. I was hoping his mother would be the same, however I never met her until a while later, and only very briefly. (Two car rides from the movie theater dates she ""generously"" let us go on.) But early on I would see how crazy she was.

Only a week after we started dating she found him talking in one of our Skype group chats and she went ballistic and banned him from ever using a computer outside of school. Further more she tried masquerading as him in the chat, but one of the people went ""It isn't him."" and she went off on us for talking to a CHILD. He was 17 at the time, and I had to clarify this. Due to this event she yanked him out of choir and gave his already paid Disney trip away to another student, but ""graciously"" let him stay in band, started doing routine checks of his locker so I'd have to hide stuff for him in mine (Literally just drawings and notes we sent back and fourth.) and took all of his belongings he didn't already have hidden (More on that later.) and threw them out except for his magic cards, which she let him give away to his friends. This would just be the starting point of all the abusive behavior.

Our only way of contact was through school, and a Kindle that he'd hide from his mother. He has three younger siblings (Smallest age gap being 8 years.) who would frequently loose it already, so they actually had no clue it was him who had it and simply thought one of the kids lost it and they'd find it later. We talked through Tumblr notes (Massaging wasn't out yet.) and that was it. Months into our relationship, he told me that his mother was telling him that he could do better than me and that my (Diagnosed!!) anxiety was fake. She had seen me a total of two times, for only about two minutes a piece. This hurt me and upset my parents greatly, but there really wasn't anything I could do. He said he loved me and that he wasn't going to listen to her. Shortly after this, I got a tablet from my mother, and I decided to gift it to him along with making him his own Gmail and Skype so we could talk. He was over the moon and that tablet was the saving grace for him and our relationship, and he kept it hidden behind a mirror in the bathroom and under his mattress for the couple of years until he moved out. 

When I graduated (I'm a year older than he is.) I asked his mother if he could come to my graduation dinner and then bring him back, and she had to think long and hard about it before saying ""I guess, but he has to be back by 6."" But after I graduated it just got worse. I'd walk down to see him before school starts as his bus was one of the first to get there. This was fine up until he came to my house one day. I don't remember what, but he was allowed to leave school early and so thought to visit me. It was nice up until he gets a call from his mom. Nosy her, she called the school for something and they told her that he had left, but was allowed to. She was enraged that he didn't come home and told him we couldn't date and that she'd pick him up immediately. I texted her, telling her that it was my fault and that he shouldn't be punished. She never answered me, but I found out it was the right number. Well this didn't stop us because he had the tablet, and I still visited him. One teacher even told her that I was and she said she'd come and confront me, so I stayed away. She ended up never coming around and I started visiting him again during spring, and we got away with seeing each other during his finals and spending time together.

He gets a job soon after graduating and due to family issues he and his mother move out and away from his abusive step-father. A short thing about the step-father, his mother knew that her husband would verbally abuse and use her son, but wouldntydo anything about it. He would make my fiance go out and strip wire for hours on end in a dark shed, tell him he was worthless, and would ground him constantly for the simplest of things. Anyways, they move out and soon after we see an opportunity for him to get out himself, as he was 18 at the time and didn't have practically any possesions. It was simple, and we moved him into my parents house in less than an hour. His mother threw a huge fit, but cooled when she realized that she can just make him constantly watch his siblings. Not much really happened during that time, but about a year later due to my own family (This wasn't messy however, and we were all on great terms.), we ended ended up moving in with her.

Worst mistake. I'll just list a couple of things that happened in the one year I lived there;
- She gained my trust a little and then immediately used it and my mental illnesses against me. She knew due to my father that I was terrified of people yelling at me, and she'd constantly threaten to yell at me if I didn't do what she wanted.
- I was very anxious around her and couldn't eat in front of her. My fiance bought me a minifridge to keep upstairs so I could eat. She finds out and throws a fit, screaming ""You think you own the place!"" My fiance was on the lease as well, and paid rent.
- She wouldn't take out the trash on time and would blame us for the overflow of bags when we had one small bag a week while she had 3-4 big bags a week.
- Wouldn't do her own dishes and said that we should do her dishes along with ours, but we rarely used dishes. She screamed at us once for adding two plates to her overflowing sink of stuff that was just hers because she ""shouldn't have to do ours.""
- One time yelled at me to come down at 6 in the morning to scream at just me to do her heaps of dishes while her kids (Who made the whole mess.) stared. Started blaming me for everything in the house.
- Overheard her constantly screaming at her kids. She doesn't have full custody of her two middle children and I have heard ""When you guys come over you ruin everything."" and ""You aren't here to have fun."" Would scream at them for simple questions being asked.
- Would look down on my fiance because she worked two jobs. Thing is, she got to work roughly twice a week even with two jobs while he worked six days a week 12 hours+ each day for less money to provide about half the rent.

There was so much more. But finally the lease was up and she wanted to move. She found herself a trailer...and didn't tell us for weeks, only to spring it on us that we had a month or less to find a place to live. Luckily we found a cheap trailer nearby and got it, but it was run down and we don't make much. A couple weeks before moving, she took all the kitchen utensils and microwave out, knowing we didn't have anything of the sort. She turned the heat off and this was when it was in the 20's, so we freeze our asses off while trying to move out on our own with no help. She never offered to help us move, but my parents loaned us their unused car and came to help us move things out.

Since moving out I have learned more about my fiance's childhood. His father died before he was born, so he never met him. His mother was a drug addict and so lost custody of him early on, so he stayed with his father's parents while she ran around doing drugs. They wanted her to be a mother to him though and gave him back right before his first sibling was born. He basically raised his two middle siblings while she was going through a divorce. After she decided to clean her act up and found a man who also was getting sober, and they got married and has the youngest. This was the abusive step-father, and life only got worse from there. The reason he already knew to hide his stuff was because she and step would carelessly throw his stuff away any time they wanted if he upset them. The more expensive stuff she'd take away and then regift it back to him for Christmas.

Since moving out we barely have contacted her. All she ever called for was when she wanted him to do something for her, despite him having a job and being busy. He confronted her about her behavior and she went off, saying that she hasn't done anything wrong and that he was being disrespectful. He told her either she apologizes, or we will not be coming back for holidays. Just last month I found out she unfriended me on Facebook, probably to rant about us and not let us see it. On there she portrays herself as a loving mother to her children and like her life is perfect, and she is surrounded by yes men who sinply believe her and comment on how beautiful her family is."
87,"**Update at the bottom**

No advice is needed, but commiseration is welcome. 

Background: D(ear)H (50) has an uncommon (but not rare) medical condition (along with a couple fairly common ones). Occasionally, he has a flareup of symptoms. When he has a flareup, he goes next door to his mom's to use the shower (we don't have one) to help alleviate some of his misery. 

DH has been dealing with his condition for several years now, and he's getting all the non-surgical treatment available. We've researched the condition and its treatments on credible medical sites, in addition to seeing actual medical specialists. We know what he's dealing with, and that the doctors are doing everything they can.

MIL does not handle DH's flareups well. I understand that DH is her son, and seeing him in misery makes her sad and feel helpless to make him feel better. On that, she and I are in the same boat. 

Where it gets really frustrating for me and DH is when she starts insisting that ""they could be doing more for him"" and ""he needs to go to the hospital"". First off, unless she wants him to undergo a radical surgical procedure (which is a last-resort treatment), they're doing everything they can to treat him. Second, going to the hospital (ER) isn't *always* necessary, and there isn't a whole lot *they* can do for him, aside from giving him fluids and IV versions of the meds he already takes. And most of the time, DH is discharged still feeling miserable, but rehydrated. 

MIL, who is generally a negative person anyway, talks to DH and me as though we haven't two brain cells between us when it comes to his condition. She acts like we just wander through life with our heads up our asses and have *no clue* that DH's serious medical condition is *SERIOUS*. It takes every ounce of self-control not to lose my shit and go off on her. We *KNOW* how serious it is! We've done the research (which, btw, she *hasn't*)! 

 I'm really just venting, as DH is in no condition right now to commiserate (he's in a flareup, we just got back from the ER, and he just wants to sleep). Thanks for the eyeballs! ❤

**Update:** DH slept through the night, and he seems to be feeling much better this morning. Hopefully, he's on the downhill side of this flareup. We'll follow up with his care teams asap.

MIL has kept her ""learn-ed"" opinions to herself since we got back. She's still convinced that his condition is deadly (it *can* be, long-term, but his co-morbid conditions would do him in first, if left untreated, which they aren't). She'll still try to slip in some advice when she can, but we've gotten pretty good at grey rocking and doing what's best for DH according to his doctors."
88,"Hey folks, so I had a couple of nickname suggestions for my JNMIL but I honestly can’t remember what they were so I’m open to more suggestions.

Backstory to catch people up: My wife and I are a lesbian couple, we had an adopted son (17) and have two foster children (F11 and M7). We also have our son’s girlfriend (16) living with us because she’s pregnant with our 17 y/o son’s child. When JNMIL found out about the baby she went nuts and told us to “get rid” of the foster kids. So my FDIL show off her mamma bear spine and isn’t taking her crap. We had a meeting with JNMIL where she just pouted and cried and shit. We went NC for a couple weeks (so far) before she tried to extend an olive branch to us.

On to the new stuff: 

So my wife received an email from her mother (JNMIL) asking to talk and also outlining her plans for her relationship with our foster daughter (FD). I’ll bullet point the Important things as most of the email was filler and irrelevant. 

1. FD and JNMIL would go out to dinner/movie/shopping day/getting their nails done once a week for the foreseeable future (No)

2. FD and FS (foster son) will be getting rooms at her house. (Also No)

3. FD and FS will not be required to call her Grammy but she would really appreciate it as she “hasn’t been feeling loved lately” (Up to the kids honestly)

4. FD will be getting a hand written apology note and an in person reading of said note by JNMIL. (Not sure if it’s a sincere apology, but we’re open to hearing it) 

5. JNMIL will buy and entire new wardrobe for both kids and make sure they “never want for anything” (Hell No)

6. She will teach FD about cooking because cooking is the best way to bring people together (This might be true but we aren’t sure about it)

7. JNMIL will make sure that FD and FS feel loved in her presence (I’m worried how she’s going to make her “love” for them known)


So yeah. Two weeks without her only daughter and access to her future great grandbaby and she threw away her entire argument and is completely changed! If only it were that easy. 

I have a feeling this is far from over. FD has expressed to us that she was hurt by what JNMIL had said to her. But also that she does feel loved and welcome in our home no matter what JNMIL says. We’re happy she feels this way, but just the same as we did for S when we were fostering him we have both kids in therapy to help them work through any trauma being in the system/living with their BioMom may have caused. 


I honestly wouldn’t mind advice but please keep it constructive."
89,"so back story, my SO and i have been together for a year now and I've felt like his parents didnt like me from the get go. we lived/ i moved in with them for like 3 month then we got our own place and everything changed. for awhile i would have been tricked that they liked me a least a bit. his dad has an ego problem and his mom is manipulating. 

now  for the content of my question, after like a monthish maybe less his mom started messaging him nasty things about me ""behind my back"" but obv he let me see them. it increased after the car his dad forced him to get (we had picked and saved money for a car and his dad made an executive decision with our money and car and got the one be wanted us to have which was a pos 2005 kis spectra with major rust on the bottom, like it was really rusted out and my parents were concerned about me driving it since at the time they were 3½ hrs away) kapoted and they let us 'borrow' his dads truck which i was v uncomfy with and they needed 'help' around the house so since they gave us a ride they thought it was fair to ask something from us even though we didnt ask for it. she was saying things like 'she making you lie to us' and 'shes a bad influence on you' and just straight up calling me a bitch (his dad even named a dog after me cause of how much of a 'bitch' it was. the doggo is now ours and we changed her name, but its more like they couldnt brainwash me and control me like they wanted) and that i could "" fuck off"" when i had mentioned that our parents maybe wouldn't get along. at this point im v upset about it and dont want anything to do with em but she goes and pulls the guilt card on her son saying im ""taking him away from them"" they lived a block maybe less away and are both on disability. they do nothing all day, correction his dad does nothing all day, and couldnt take a few minutes outta their day to come to us? why is it that we have to go to them. she had to have knee surgry and asked us to help and gave me a half-assed apology. anyway im currently banned from their house for 'being rude and lying' and hatted by both of em for things i didnt do. my SO even flat out told them its all him and his mom couldnt stop saying im walking over him when im not.

i should mention i dont hate them in any way, shape, or form it just bothers me that she couldnt say it to my face"
90,"I’m sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile and this might get long and ranty. 

I just found this sub and after reading a few posts I believe I may have found the appropriate place to bitch about her.

The last thing is still ongoing, as most things are... basically I need someone to help watch my kids so hubs can go to therapy with me. This is in two weeks so there’s plenty of time. We have zero other people to even consider asking otherwise we would. We have been trying to get him in with my therapist for this one session for two months now. Last time we tried asking her she point blank wouldn’t. Not couldn’t and was busy, just wouldn’t. 

So I text her a couple days ago explaining that hubs needs to go with me and we need someone to watch the kids. I said it politely and asked. Not demanding or rudely as some would assume. No answer that day. I follow up the next day with a ‘did you get my message?’. Still no response. 

So out of frustration we contact FIL and ask if she’s ok bc she isn’t answering her phone. He comes back with ‘her phone has been acting up and dropping calls and texts’. After he calls MIL and confirms this (bullshit) she says she’d call me today. 

So she does and tries telling me the same that her phone isn’t working. Which yeah that may be plausible but there’s just too much bad history between us for it to be a coincidence. So she basically ghosted me to avoid saying no and watching her grandchildren. I fully understand and respect that she doesn’t have to do shit for us or watch the kids ever. We don’t ask them to anymore bc it’s just not worth it. What pisses me off though is her acting like a child and then lying about her phone not working. 

This is just the latest thing. I’m sure with the holidays around the corner I’ll have more. 

Then there’s the outward and blatant favoritism of the grandchildren. My kids are not the favorites either. 

I have three kids. My oldest lives with his dad now but has always been with me until last year. So last Christmas was his first Christmas gone and with his dad. 

There were a ton of presents for everyone. All the grandkids get spoiled from them. Except this year they did not get my son anything. Not a card, gift card or a single present sent to him. Nothing. No one except me even seemed to notice this. Even writing this out really pisses me off all over again. 

This is just a small dose of my monster in-law."
91,"On Sunday, my fiancé and I announced that we set a date for our wedding to his family at his birthday dinner.
Prior to this I was no contact for just over 3 months; it’s been amazing.

Today, not even 72 hours later, her and her fiancé announced their wedding date. 

One. Freaking. Week. Before. Us. 

Seriously? You’ve got 51 other weekends in the year and you choose that one? 
On Sunday they were speaking about being so unsure  about a date and suddenly they have one? 

I’m so frustrated at the chaos this will bring and how she will want to outdo us even though we’ve opted for a small celebration with friends and family.

."
92,"This has been bothering me for awhile. I thought this would be a good place to post. 

MIL is the kind of person who doesn’t know when to keep a question to herself. Ever since we got together it’s a constant “Is she pregnant.” Or “Are you pregnant.” Following every big decision we make. Moving in together, getting a new family safe car, engagement, telling her he’s looking for an engagement ring, etc. I could understand if this was happening all within a few months, but it’s a four year long relationship. None of this even happened until a year into it. She even forgot we were engaged at one point. I’m trying to hold out hope that she doesn’t intend for it to come off this way, but damn I’m feeling like he can’t love me unless I’m pregnant. 

Now we’re married for like six months and in comes the MIL with the thing that’s ticked me and my husband off. “You need to wait until I’m stable before you have kids.” Excuse you? What? She goes on this long narrative about how she isn’t ready for grandkids. She “can’t afford them” and she’s “not the grandma type.” 

Were financially independent. We have a house, we have healthcare, I wouldn’t even have to work if I didn’t want to and chose to take care of the kid. There’s nothing she would need to provide and we never asked her to. Our baby, our responsibility. MIL has had years to get her life together and didn’t do it for her 3 kids, why would she do it for mine? 

Well, the “I’m not the grandma type” resulted in my husband telling her that if she doesn’t want to be a grandma she doesn’t have to be. She ends up going off, saying we’re being mean to her. She is a good mother. She never said she didn’t want to be in her grandkids lives. She starts crying and ends the conversation with a “Do whatever you want.” Before hanging up. 

Am I being dramatic? Should I just let this go? I never said anything to her, but I’m still extremely angry she would say any of this."

94,"New user here. First time posting. I'm sure my situation isn't as bad as others but it's still frustrating. 

I recently opened up my home to my JNMom. She's a recovering addict who made my childhood a living hell. More often then not growing up I had to be the one parenting her. It made me grow up fast which could be considered a good thing but I still harbor a lot of resentment for her never being a ""mother"".

I know it was foolish but I had this hope that I'd open my home to her and she'd actually help out and be self sufficient and get on her feet finally. But that's not looking to be the case. In the short time span she's been here she's been nothing but needy. I feel like I'm taking care of two children instead of just one.

All she does is sit around the house and complain. Complains that the trash needs taken out but doesn't lift a finger to do it even though she's home all day while I work. Complains that she needs to go to the store but refuses to use my car and insists I take her and chauffeur her around even though I worked 12 hours. Making demands and complaining when things don't go her way. Just some more examples:

-While I was at work she kept texting me complaining that she was cold, as if I could do something about it. I told her to turn the air up, she refuses and says it's the fan, so I tell her to turn the fan off. She refuses that as well and insists that she have my comforter even though I gave her the extra one I had for while she's here. When I told her she could use it but I would need it back when I got home she got all huffy and continued to complain about how coooold she is as if I could do something about it while I'm all the way at work.

-She went to the park with my daughter and my daughters other grandmother (dad's side) and fell and lightly scraped her knee. The rest of the night she kept texting me and sending me pictures about how bad it was (it wasn't). I get home from a long night of work to her still complaining about it similar to how a child feigns injury for a parents attention.

-She mentioned wanting donuts because she's hungry in the morning but refuses to cook for herself. I offered to get her some one day and she refused. This morning before I got off work I get a text saying ""well are you brining donuts home or waiting until daughter is here (she's with her dad on the days I work)?"" I ask her if she wants donuts and she responds ""Yes bring me donuts"" no please to be found. The first thing out of her mouth when I got home was ""where are the donuts"" which I handed to her and walked away. I got into bed exhausted and she walked into my bedroom and asks me to turn the air up because she's cold.

She literally cannot and will not do anything for herself. She's immature, rude, ungrateful, and just a general pain. I do not know how long I will be able to handle her. This ""woe is me I'm your poor old mother who needs help and to be taken care of"" act is annoying and I'm over it. I give her an inch and she takes a mile. Please tell me I'm not over reacting.

TLDR I allowed my mother to move in with me to get back on her feet seeing as how she's a recovering addict and does not have any of her crap together. She's abusing my kindness and acting like a child, expecting me to take care of her. I cannot take it and it's making me very resentful.

Edited to add the icing on this whole cake: she's been here two weeks and has spent most of the time here held up in my daughters room (where she's staying while she's here) or taking control of the living room TV. She's made zero effort to see her son (my 14 year old half brother) who she hasn't seen in FIVE YEARS or her DYING MOTHER (my grandmother has cancer. I've seen her several times in preparation for the worst but it's easily been six or more years since my JNMom has seen her). You know what she has made an effort to do? Spend hundreds of dollars on gas money for her friend who is also an addict to come pick her up and take her to a city where she got her FELONY drug charge so that she can hang out with her old addict friends. This is the thing that has me heated the most."
95,"TRIGGER WARNING:  death of an infant

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time posting but I have been a longtime lurker.

My son (DS1) passed away 5 years ago.  He was 2 months old and it was completely unexpected.  My JNMom was okay to deal with for probably the next two years even though she has been a Just No my entire life.  However, she became increasingly more difficult to deal with until it boiled over a year ago.

A little background about my mother that I feel needs to be known.  My JNMom was in the process of divorcing JYSDad when my son died.  Before the divorce was finalized she met a man on a dating site that I will call JNBF.  JNBF moved in with her immediately.  He came from several states away to meet in person for the first time and moved in that day.  There is so much that happened but I will post about that another day.  To make the story short JNBF was a raging alcoholic who turned my mother into a raging alcoholic.

During this time my mother would call me up weekly and tell me about how she talked to DS1 every day.  I, at this time, allowed her to talk about him to me because I realize everyone grieves differently.  If it would become to much for me I would just change the subject.  Eventually she just became crazier and we had to have her institutionalized.  JNBF was gone.  She came out with a diagnosis of bipolar on top of already prior being diagnosed as schizophrenic.

After rehab she went to live with her parents who made sure she stayed sober.  Within a few day she called me and wanted to tell me how DS1 ruined her life.  She didn't even say his death ruined her life but my son.  I immediately cut her off and said No.  She then asked if she could talk to DH about DS1 ruining her life.  Again No.  I told her if she had issues about DS1's death she needed to talk to her therapist about it.  Her response was that they would not understand.  I told her that I didn't understand either and that she was to never speak of DS1 to me again.

I was so mad for a long time.  I had got to a point where I could think and talk about my son without it being sad.  I could think of all the happy memories I had.  After this though every time I thought about him I thought about her which made me mad.  I am sure this is what she wanted.

For the last year and a half she has obeyed me about not talking about him except for one or two times which I shut down.  However, a couple of nights ago she was on the phone with DS2, who is only 2, and started telling him about how she talks to DS1 all the time.  How DS1 tells her he loves his sibling and stuff like that.  Of course, DS2 can't understand her and is just babbling nonsense.  He wasn't her target though, she knew the phone was on speaker.  I didn't shut it down like I should have because I didn't want my son to hear me respond how I would have to the mention of DS1.  I don't want him to ever think that it is something that I would not talk to him about.  My DD was 3 when DS1 passed away and she talks about DS1 which we encourage.

My question for all of you that have made it this far is do I just not say anything or do I confront her again?  Also, I am already VLC with her.  We might talk on the phone once or twice a month.

Edit:  For those asking why I am not already NC.  My grandparents are the only reason.  I could careless about her.  I did go NC when she made the comment.  However she was living with my grandparents at the time so it became difficult to do so without affecting them.  When they pass, which unfortunately will be soon most likely, I will be going full NC."
96,"I’m fucking furious. Holy shit.

She picked me up from his house and we went to get food. She was on the phone with my JNGrandma talking about shit and my Grandma asked, “Is her boyfriend skinny? Or fat?” My mom said, “He’s not skinny. He’s fat. He’s got a beer gut and looks like an old guy” and laughed. I immediately turned to her and said, “You don’t look so hot yourself.” She laughed again and said, “Oh she’s already defending him”, and my grandma replied, “Good. Defend what’s yours.” (mmm don’t like that saying bc I don’t own him but I get what she was saying)

I wanted to say so much more, but my mom has hit me and my brother before and I was scared of it happening again. But believe me, I had a LOT that I wanted to say.

My boyfriend is a bit on the chonky side. I love it. I love his body so much. I kiss his face, his arms, hands, tummy, thighs, EVERYTHING. I tell him all the time that I love his body. What matters here is: Am I satisfied? Yes? Then who cares? Why should she be a cunt?

I’m just angry because her comment was so fucking unnecessary.

I tried talking to my dad about it privately but she came in and stuck her face between us and was like, “I wanna know! Tell me what you’re talking about!”. I got irritated and my dad told her nothing, and asked, “Aw, are you and BF fighting again?” because he was trying to change the subject (god bless my dad for being so fucking smart and good to me). I said no, but my mom excitedly gasped and said, “You two are fighting? Why? What!” and I got angry and said, “Oh my god, you guys are so fucking annoying” and left. 

My mom immediately called for me but I ignored her and went into my room. I texted my dad and apologized and said I didn’t mean it (I really didn’t mean it for him, only her. I had to keep up an act and dad knew what I was doing). She checked on me and called me “Annoying Girl”, then went to shower. 

Dad texted me saying she was in the shower and came over to my room. He asked me what happened and I told him, and he was pissed. We talked for a good bit and he said he completely understood why I’m angry and agreed that she was being a bitch.

We hugged and I apologized again, and my dad said he wasn’t offended at all and knew what I was doing.

Yes, I know I was out of line for what I said regarding the annoying part, and I apologized to my dad for it (not apologizing to my mom because she WAS being annoying and a bitch).

I’m not telling BF this. He’d be absolutely heartbroken and I’d see no point in it unless I wanted to hurt him, which is the VERY last thing I’d ever want to do, especially with his body image issues. :(

I’m so angry. Fuck."
97,My dh took Jesus cookies banana queen to my 12 year old daughters birthday lunch out. She then told him she wouldn’t be leaving the house to him because she doesn’t like my sense of style. He said he was relieved - she will NEVER pay that monstrosity of a house off. I agree - dodged that bullet. Lol supposed to say “wrote my DH” sorry.
98,"My daughter is 2.5 years old. When she was 18 months old my mother in law, ""Iapetus"", looked after her alone and she got my daughter's ears pierced with a piercing gun at the mall.

I asked her what exactly possessed her to do that to my child and she said that my daughter's hair was too short so she made her look ""girlier"", and she called me a hypocrite as I had my ears pierced but wasn't willing to do the same for my daughter. I told her that I got my ears pierced at 18 in a professional piercing place and she had no right to do that, but Iapetus said that she was responsible for my daughter at the time so it was her choice, and that my daughter would probably want her ears pierced eventually anyway.

The piercings got infected and the GP advised taking them out after the infection cleared up, so I did. Iapetus is still upset that the piercings were removed and wants to get them redone by the same store. I banned Iapetus from seeing my daughter, and no contact was upheld for about 3 weeks, at which point my (soon to be ex) husband invited her over. To this day there has been no expression of guilt from her and no shiny spine from soon to be ex husband, which is part of the reason he's a soon to be ex.

Since then Iapetus has been aware that she's on wafer thin ice with me, and has not done anything harmful or detrimental to my daughter since Ex and I looked to be on the rocks. However, I am fairly confident in stating that the reason she hasn't done anything harmful or detrimental to my daughter is that she has yet to be left alone with her. I've not left Iapetus alone with my daughter at all in the past year, just in case she tries something.

Ex and I need to go sign divorce papers on Friday. Everything is ironed out and we won't be fighting, it's just a matter of signing the agreed terms.

Iapetus has gotten in touch, knowing Friday is my work from home day and the day my daughter does not go to daycare, and has said that if we want someone to watch her while we sign papers, she is ""more than happy to look after her"" and has said they can have a ""girls' day"". If Iapetus did watch her then I'd need to bring my daughter to her an hour before the meeting, and Iapetus would bring her back ""whenever"" (her exact words: ""I'll bring her back whenever I'm ready"") which does not sound good.

There is no one else available to watch my daughter and she's not booked in to daycare during the time I will be with the lawyers. I asked the daycare if there was any way we could extend her hours but they said all changes needed to be 2 weeks in advance, and I only got the time/date for signing the papers yesterday.

So my options are leaving my daughter alone with Iapetus and hoping she doesn't come back with freshly pierced ears or taking her with me to sign papers.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  I rang to ask about the logistics of bringing Kiddo with me and turns out they have a ""kids area"" which is pretty much a playmat and some legos supervised by a receptionist meant specifically for kids whose parents are busy signing stuff. Ex and I could even take turns signing papers and checking on kiddo."
99,"As you all know, we have been VLC with Amy Winepurse and she’s doing the usual that we see on here. Crying and carrying on to anyone who will listen. 

So a couple days ago, we saw AWP at BIL1’s house. When we arrived, she was in the house and didn’t come out for 10-15 minutes. She was basically quiet and kept the disappearing act going on and off (going inside alone for 10-20 minutes at a time). I gray rocked like a champ and she paid no attention to me (except to go silent if I joined the area she was standing in). I think she is picking up the pace on over grooming SIL2 also. A direct quote from an otherwise silent and depressed persona was “Oooooh yeah!!! Yeah!!! That’s my giiirl!!!” when SIL2 drank alcohol. She did ask me if I’ve seen GMIL, and had (I’m assuming) SIL1 ask if we’ve gotten our wedding pics back. I said a flat yes to both. 

Right before she left, AWP told BIL1 she would see him in a few days for her birthday party. Convo went like this:

BIL1: oh, what’s going on then? Do we have plans?

AWP: Well now that your brother (DH) is a great cook, (looks at me) we could have it at his house!

Me: *bursts out in laughter* (said nothing)

AWP: oh woah alletnomnom are you saying he is not???  

Me: *sips beer* (By the way, I laughed that she was inviting her party to happen at my house, not about DH’s cooking skills)

BIL: oh alright well let me know what we are doing.

I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before but AWP has been obsessed with coming over ever since she heard GMIL has been to our house. Flash forward to today, DH got a group text from his siblings, and he did pretty good!!

BIL1 texted SIL1 and DH asking if everyone is free for AWP’s birthday. SIL1 responded that she is free, and asked if they were planning to bring me and SIL2, because “AWP would like it if it is just us”.

DH said yes I am bringing my wife, I think we should bring everyone. 

Good news, DH and I have overcome two hurdles here, which is 1 him knowing this is wrong and sticking to what we’ve talked about, and 2 that he willingly told me about it, even though I’m sure he doesn’t want to deal with it. Bad news, it seems SIL1 is back to being a flying monkey, for whatever reason. 

As always, tell me thoughts, advice, whatever I could be missing here. This sub’s predictions and insights have helped DH and I so so much. Also, DH is home now, and told me he wants to read the actual messages to me. If anything else comes up, I’ll give y’all an update.

UPDATE: It’s minor, but after reading the texts it is clear both of DH’s siblings agreed Winepurse would prefer if it’s “just them”. However they decided to invite SOs (and spouse) and BIL1 asked SIL1 and DH to let him know ASAP if me and BIL2 were coming. I wonder why he needed to know ASAP? The restaurant they decided on is a casual bar like setting, so no reservations required."
100,"ETA TW - Miscarriage

I’m pretty new to reddit, and have had NC with my in-laws for several years, so I have no new juicy stories to share. But I love this sub, reading stories, and I’ve seen people post stories from the past and thought I would share my very first JNMIL experience. 

My husband and I met in 2007. I was 18 (a senior in high school), and he was 24 (in college). We were really supposed to be a one night stand, but due to a broken condom and not being informed of how an antibiotic might interfere with my birth control, I ended up pregnant. I told my husband, and he was determined to do ‘the right thing’. I told him that I had no intention of staying in a relationship for the sake of a child, but I was open to starting a relationship with him to see if we were compatible. If it worked out, great. If it didn’t, oh well. We vowed to stay on good terms regardless. It turned out that we were very well suited for each other. 

I told my mother almost immediately. I might have even told her before I told my husband, I’m not sure. It was... anticlimactic. I climbed into her bed while she was watching TV one afternoon after school, and sat in silence trying to work up the nerve to tell her. After a while, she picked up the remote, turned off the tv, and said, “you’re pregnant, aren’t you?” I said yes and asked if she was mad. She asked, “will getting angry do anyone any good?” And that was that. 

I asked my husband when we should tell his parents. He was extremely reluctant. His father is a pastor. He knew it would not go over well. Him and I sat down with my mother to discuss a plan to tell them. She said that she would go with us to try and help diffuse any theatrics/drama (she sounds amazing in this story, but she has had her fair share of JN moments throughout our relationship). So at around 9 weeks, the three of us drove over to his parents house (he lived with them at the time). 

We all sat down in their living room, and while he sat there silently, completely terrified and embarrassed, my mother blurts out that I’m pregnant. They sat in stunned silence. When they regained their composure, his mother’s first question was what denomination of Christianity I belonged to and what church the baby would be raised in. I informed them that I’m an atheist and the baby would not be raised in any church. Her response? “Well, that just won’t do. There is a nice infertile couple at our church who will adopt it.” 

I had literally no words other than, “excuse me? No.” She went on some rant about me being a slut, trying to trap her precious little boy and ruin his life, and I would be a terrible mother if I won’t even take it to church. Eventually, my mother stepped in to defend me and that whether or not we wanted to keep the baby, and who we were going to give it to if we chose adoption was not up to them. Told them that we had informed them of the situation, the conversation was now over, and we left. 

Two days later, the landline rang. My brother answered the phone and yelled for me. It was a woman I didn’t know. She introduced herself. And then went on about how she wanted to let me know how excited she was that I was going to let them adopt my baby, wanted to know when we could meet up to discuss the terms of the adoption, and asked when my next prenatal appointment was because she would really like to come. I asked her where she had gotten my phone number, and she said that JNMIL had given it to her. I then hung up. Probably not the most polite thing to do, but I was 18, and absolutely furious. 

A few hours later, the phone rang again. I got to the phone first. It was JNMIL. She jumped straight into a rant about how selfish I was. How rude I was to just hang up on someone gracious enough to save her son from me tarnishing their good name by adopting my bastard. How could I be so cruel to deny this family the child they’ve always wanted and prayed for when they’ve already had two failed adoptions. I walked back to my mother’s bedroom and handed her the phone because it was just way above my pay grade. I went to my room and cried while my mother yelled at JNMIL for a while. She then came and consoled me, assuring me that no matter what his parents said or did, it was still my decision. 

The whole thing came to an abrupt halt at 13 weeks when I miscarried. We were devastated. JNMIL called again after my husband told them. My mother answered and wouldn’t let them speak to me. There was more yelling. When I asked her what they wanted, she said that they wanted to give me the couple’s phone number because they felt the news that their child had died should come from me. 

And yeah. They have hated me ever since."
101,"This happened almost 14 months ago so no advice needed. We got my son a giant Mylar 1st birthday balloon with a certain red puppet that he loves for his birthday a few weeks. This bad boy is still floating and while my son was playing with it today it remained me of last year. When my tried to keep my balloons from my baby shower to give to her mother who couldn’t make the shower. Now on to the story...

My sister threw me an  shower at a Mac and cheese restaurant. It was classy and small and of course the food was awesome. Since I decided to wait till birth to find out the gender my shower theme was grey and yellow. In order to off set some costs I tried to get a much stuff as possible off amazon. I found a complete set of decorations which included a bunch of latex balloons and one giant Mylar balloon baby. At the time of the shower I worked at a grocery store with a very nice flower shop. When the woman who runs the flower opened the Mylar balloon it had a hole in it. Because flower lady is extremely lovely she offered to replace it with two medium gender neutral balloons for free. She also gave me a discount on the blowing up the balloons. She truly saved the day. 

My mom decided this was a perfect time to ask me invasive questions and make comments about how big I am. I just ignored her and focused on my friends. My mil sat in the back with her sister and her niece. I didn’t hear from her at all that day. She didn’t even say hi. she’s very socially awkward so I’m not surprised. I just ignored her back. 

Anywho the shower wraps up and I’m helping my sister clean up and pack up the gifts. We’re also trying to divvy up gifts into the vehicles so they can all be transported back to mine and dhs place. I grab a small thing of the latex balloons and the one Mylar one. That are bundled together. I gave the rest of the latex balloons to my 5ur old niece to play with. At this point my dh has the car packed and it’s taking some people who don’t drive home. Including my mil. She takes the other Mylar balloon with her but I just thought she was being helpful and carrying as much stuff as possible with her. So we get out of there faster. I hitch a ride with my sister. She drops me off at home and helps me bring in al the gifts from her car. Then ail shows up with her load to drop off. Then my dh comes back. 

We’re sorting thru the stuff and I noticed my missing balloon. I asked him if he left it in the car. He said no his mom took it to give to his grandmother since she missed out on the shower. My sweet summer child of a dh was still in the fog and didn’t think anything of it. I explained to him that she stole it because she didn’t want to even ask me if she could have it. She just assumed. 

Also I want some mementos from my shower and since they were provided by my work I wanted to keep them both. My work already knew I wasn’t going back because I plan on being a sahm. I thought it was so sweet all the did for my while I was pregnant and the balloons were the icing on the cake. So obviously I wanted them. Also the shower is about me not fucking cartoon villain. I’m the pregnant one and I don’t ask for a lot but I think I’m entitled to one good damn day where I’m the center of attention. So after my freak out he left and got my balloon back. 

This should have been the final straw to show what an enabler my mil was but sadly it wasn’t My 1st post here was and that’s when I decided to drop the rope."
102,"She got to FSIL. She told her that I hate the family, I’m poisoning him against her, and I’m a horrible person. FSIL messaged me today and quit the wedding (she was a bridesmaid, we’ve become such good friends). 

 I’m bawling at my desk at work. I’m blindsided and so devastated."
103,"Does anyone have a MIL who seems to disrespect their time and job?
I started up my own business a few years back, since then I have expanded it into 3 other related avenues and am doing really well for myself.
Making on par with DH, looking into buying warehouse space and upping employment. 
My business is also DHs retirement plan, as he won't be able to do his current job into old age. We are a team and work well together, but I don't think MIL sees it that way. My job is never talked about in a serious light and I seem to think it's viewed as a housewives hobby, like selling Avon or something. 
I am starting to think MIL doesn't think or act like my job is a ""job"" or that my work schedule takes any priority when planning holiday events. We had to drop off some tools yesterday and she asked DH, not us a couple but him alone when ""he"" would be free for her families annual xmas dinner, as she wanted to plan it around ""his"" schedule and she wanted ""him"" there. 
My schedule wasn't asked about nor was the invitation really directed towards me...
I am thinking about just not going. I wasn't really invited and I am not the sort of woman who works her life around her husbands schedule, which seems like what is expected.
I am overreacting to expect that my time be respected and accounted for when it comes to holiday planning? My family always works around both mine and DH schedules when it comes to planning. 
I missed 2 xmas parties the year before last  (MIL throws 5 each year!! Probably for the attention as she hates to cook)  and copped so much crap for it. It meant I didn't like the family apparently...and caused a heap of drama and tears.
I am also hosting a 2k+ people event for work around the time of all these annoying parties, but that doesn't seem to be a big deal to MIL or an excuse to miss ""Family Time"".
How can I make her respect my job and time?"
104,"This is really a post about my mom's dwindling control over my horribly enmeshed sister. Sounds like mom chucked a wild tanty today in public over the loss of a small piece of that control. 

My mom was a huge JustNo until I was outside her control and no longer living with my family. I moved out shortly after my 21st birthday. Leaving permanently was the best thing that's ever happened to me in my relationship with my mom. We became almost close and are on extremely good terms. We've been good for probably close to five years at this point. I'm getting close to dirty thirty. 

She had always tried to helicopter parent hard af, and as a teenager I reacted pretty poorly to her trying to control every aspect of my life. I bucked all of her attempts to rein me in like a wild horse. Our dynamic was pretty bad. I was the defiant one. I'm not willing to say much else about what went on back then at the moment. 

My sister though... my poor sister. My sister got the worst of ALL OF IT. She's some years younger than I am and she fell into the role of being the ""good"" child who was completely controlled in every way. She built her life around being the good one, and was constantly told not to act like me. She didn't buck that control AT ALL because she feared being treated like I was.  

For starters, I don't even want to think about what age she started brushing her own teeth, tying her own shoes, and cutting her own food. She never did anything independently. When she was a teen our mom would literally go to all concerts, movies, the mall, etc with her and her friends. I moved out when she was a young teen so I never saw the worst of the helicoptering in real time, but I did hear about it. 

She's an adult now but her independence is so crippled. She lives with our parents, doesn't drive, and our mom still takes her to all her appointments. Mom still has to be involved in EVERYTHING. And it's like this because my sister allowed it, but she's working on it. She has a therapist now and everything, and I am super proud of her. 

She sent me a text today about our mom and the fact that she's taking her power back a little. My response was super firm because of what I've learned here, from you guys. So thank you all sincerely, from the bottom of my cold little heart that's two sizes too small. You helped me help my sister better than I could have before.

105,"This is an older story and I just need to get it off my chest cause my MIL is driving me batty.

So about 4 ish years ago, my DH and I were living with his parents. For the most part, I just kept to myself and stayed in our bedroom when I was at home to relax. I worked 40+ hours a week and typically saw them for maybe 20 minutes a day with my work schedule and such. 

Well, every week we would try to do family dinners. During one of these dinners, I was in the kitchen helping JNMIL cook and DH was outside with JYFIL grilling the goods. So while it was just the two of us, she decides to tell me that her SISTER  (no children and lives over 3000 miles away), whom I've never met, told her to kick us out because we were adults and needed to learn how ""the world works"". 

Now this lady knows absolute NOTHING about me or our situation, besides what JNMIL has told her and God knows what that entails 🙄.

I was shocked and appalled. My mouth hung open for a second trying to process what she was saying. 

My own father had kicked me out and I had literally no where to go so my In-laws so graciously invited me to live with them. This happened about 8 months before this incident. 

After the shock wore off, I told her that I. Had no where to go. If I went back to my mom's (sometimes JN), I wouldn't be allowed to see DH (at the time BF) because she does NOT like him.  And I couldn't afford a place to rent so we would have been on the streets. I explained that with my loan debt and a few bad credit card choices, everything I was making was going to those payments and my car plus any other necessities I needed and the rest ($10) went into savings to move out. We just didn't have enough. 

When I told DH what she said to me, he flipped out. He's an only child and they have a sizable estate that he will inherit when they pass and he told me this afterwards, so he couldn't figure out WHY she would tel me that because they could feasibly support us (literally were not supporting us other than the room. We bought our own food, gas, offered to pay rent/help with utilities and was promptly told no by JYFIL, AND OUR OWN FUCKING TOILET CLEANER.  I mean, what more could she want? 

TL;DR : MIL'S sister tried to kick us out from MIL'S house from 3000miles away."
106,"So much has happened since I last posted here. Things came to a head about two weeks ago. It still almost doesn't feel real. The amount of restfulness I've felt since, despite the stress of the move, is utterly amazing. Finally, I can look forward to climbing out of the hole once and for all.

I was sitting at work when I realized I was completely fed up with the situation. My SO kept insisting we should wait a little longer until he could get us a house of our own with his government credit, and we had been squirreling away money towards that for a little while. However, at that moment I realized I was absolutely fed up with Dirty Hypocrite's sniping, criticism, attempts to kill our fur babies and constant complaining and threats towards both me and SO, and him being caught in the middle, trying to defend me without inviting too much of her wrath. I called my mother and begged her to help. She had my dad pick me up that night and drive me to the in-laws' to pick up half my dogs and cats and some stuff and take us to their house. We were to stay there for one week while I searched for a home. I gave my SO an ultimatum: search for a home for us and show me proof, keeping the rest of our babies safe until we have somewhere to put them, or you can forget I exist.

He came through wonderfully, sending me photos and snapshots of houses, and looking into buying a house earlier than we had anticipated. We hit a rough patch, but after a few days of frantic searching I found a house that miraculously would take us with all the babies and seemed good for our needs and within budget. My SO was convinced that he wanted it even before I was. My parents went with us to see it and my dad helped talk the lady into giving us a small discount on the rent--not much, but every little bit helps when you have furbabies! My SO got the rest of the babies safely there, and my parents were there helping me unpack, move stuff, arrange furniture, clean etc and gave us a LOT of things for the house including a nanny cam for the cats, a toilet seat, loads of food, cleaners, household items, a fridge and microwave, etc. My in-laws sent a TV, a mattress and some cutlery, I guess Dirty did it to assuage her guilt over her treatment of us or to try to win my SO back to ""her side"", because I cannot fathom any other reason that woman would help us after what she's done. We have since been settling in, and my dogs already seem so much happier. I need to do ""doggy bootcamp"" with them to touch up their training and build them a treadmill, and we're good to go.

In regards to my parents, I'm honestly not sure what happened. I broke NC because a dog was found that looks just like my childhood dog that was stolen, and I needed my mom to come help me make a positive ID. (It wasn't her, I'm still offering a reward for my girl.) She and my father both broke down in tears apologizing for having dumped me. They promised never again to leave me on my own, have laid off on trying to force me to get rid of my babies and just generally treated me with the respect and love I always wanted from them. I'm still wary and waiting for the other shoe to drop, but so far I sense no trickery from them, though of course I could be wrong. Has anyone had a similar experience/reconciliation? They did seem to be genuinely remorseful and wishing to make up for everything they did. Since then they've been very attentive, messaging me at least once every day (well, my mom has), and never ignoring my messages.

EDIT: As far as Dirty Hypocrite, true to her nasty nature to the last, the day I left she messaged my mother basically saying I was no better than a trollop, that I didn't appreciate her son and ""verbally abused"" him, that I attacked her and my FIL constantly when in reality I did my best to stay out of their way so they wouldn't hurt me or my dogs. She was alternating between basically gloating that now her son could find a woman who was truly worthy of him, and threatening to sell or kill the remaining animals if I didn't pick them up. My father messaged her back telling her in no uncertain terms that he and his lawyer friends would ruin her and my BIL if they so much as touched my animals, and she didn't have the guts to reply back. My SO has admitted that he was afraid to leave, and apologized for not getting us out sooner. Thankfully he was able to keep our babies safe from her during the few days it took us to move out. I can't help but grin when I imagine her face as she realized her son still chose me over her, LOL. She, her husband and her other son are no longer allowed near either me, my animals or our new house and as soon as I have time from work I will get a restraining order to ensure they stay away. (This being Mexico, it likely won't be worth the paper it's written on, but at least it **will** get the point across that I'm serious and I'm done being their chew toy.)

Especially satisfying also, to me, is the fact that Dirty tried telling my mother that she had to bear the ""stink and dirt"" from my animals, yet not only she but also my best friend had been to the house and in our room multiple times and even my mother, who has the most sensitive nose when it comes to animal smells, expressed surprise at how clean the room and house smelled thanks to the combined efforts of my boyfriend and I. AND they both saw the cluttered, shit and piss filled back yard where MIL's two dogs were housed."
107,"Trigger warning: mental health crisis/suicide threat


So yesterday I was having a good day for my own mental health. Trying to get back to a normal routine of taking care of myself and was very productive at work. Came home around five feeling tired but proud of myself. 


Then I got a text from my sister: ""holy shit, dad needs to take Mom to the hospital"" I have notifications turned off for Eggs so I didn't notice right away that she sent us this wall of scary:


""I honestly think I would be able to quit texting, but I am desperate to hear from you and I honestly dont know what else.to do.  Everyone is telling me to just let it lie and I cant.  The severity of the pain I'm in IS making me shake on a regular basis.  I got picked up off the concrete.floor in the shop...I was found in the fetal position crying...shriek crying...it scared the shit out of me.  I'm so tired I fall.  Gawd I need a hug from you so bad.  I'm sorry I'm needy right now.  I just need to hear i loveyou and that this is going to be ok.  Why...why have you dug your heels in so far?   Why cant this be over?  I've seen my shrink.  I'm being put on medicine to stop the brain spins.  I'm going through hell...it seems to no end.  I am in a crisis situation.  What do you think?  That I'd come after you?  You are wrong.  I need your help.  I'm not lying.  I agreed to go to your counselors with you.  Why cant that be enough?  I am pleading for your help please.  I promise to go with you.  Please stop this shut out.  I am not strong enough to withstand.it anymore.  Yell at me if you need to, but let's get this conversation going.""


I tried calling Dad first but he didn't answer. So called 911 to go check on her. They sent a few officers but told me there wasn't anything they could do if she refused to answer the door. They also asked if there were firearms in the house and I hadn't even considered that. She does have a gun, and it makes me super uncomfortable. (Not looking for a gun debate here, just don't feel comfortable with my mentally ill, impulsive mother owning one.)


Dad calls back and let's me know he's on his way home and she just got back from her psychiatrist who prescribed some new meds and gave her a list of counselors to talk to. 


I had a date with my BFF at the bar so I texted her to let her know that some shit went down so I would understand if she'd rather not hang. (She has dealt with some trauma of her own so I like to warn her of possible triggers) Of course, she was wonderful and came and we had a lovely evening. 

Hubs walked me to the bar so I wouldn't be alone cause I was pretty shaken up. During the walk we get a text from Dad, ""that text was about Saturday, your mom's ok, just really hurting"" 


We also got another text from Mom, ""Sorry to freak you out...that was Saturday and sunday...I'm just trying to get this to stop.  Please reread what I said.""


So, that just kinda pissed me off. Like, she was definitely just saying those things to get us to fawn over her. I'm so fucking pissed. I'm still glad I called the police, cause even though she was clearly bluffing, I would feel so bad if she wasn't and I thought that she was. 


I'm going to try to figure out a way to block her, but have any texts she sends go to my husband so he can catch the potential emergency ones, but we can ignore the rest. I feel like there should be an app for that. Maybe I just need to be ok with full on blocking her, but I think my sister needs to be on board too, otherwise I'll just hear about it from her anyway. As I've said before, I'm still having a hard time being ok with blocking her. I have therapy today though, so yay.

Edit: I've blocked her texts, and now I gotta figure out how to block the number. Calls are easier to ignore anyway. Hooray for me! I did it!"
108,"Thanks to everyone who commented on my previous post- your advice was much appreciated! SO is getting his own job now, and he hasn't been putting up with FMIL's negative comments on our relationship or me. He's been standing up for himself (he just walked out and drove to me when FMIL was being a cunt). Of course, FMIL flipped shit when she found out SO was getting a job, and she's still threatening to take away his car, not funding his education, etc., but FFIL is stepping in to talk to her. FMIL set an 'appointment' to talk to SO about his independence tomorrow. Yikes.

109,"Hello all. My partner and I have been married for 5 years and have lived on the opposite coast of his mother the entire duration of our relationship. I have spent collectively approximately 75 hours with my mother in law in the entire time I've known her. This includes the 12 hours straight spent with her on my wedding day and a 6 hour plane ride we spent together. We visit several times a year for a few days, as my partner's family still lives in the area. I don't really know my mother in law, my partner moved away at 18 for a reason and he's not very forthcoming as to his reasoning, which is his right. But I've never felt there was any ill will until now.

My mother in law's brother passed away quickly and unexpectedly two weeks ago. He was unmarried, unemployed, and had no children or will. He helped care for their mother who developed dementia over the summer. My mother in law took on the role of next of kin. She has been quite stressed since his death and having to take care of her mother. My partner and I did not fly out for the funeral, his choice, and he has been acting off since finding out his uncle was ill. I have asked if he is okay and he says he is fine. I'm not sure it is anything more than grief and my in law's frequent calls, which is the catalyst for why I am posting this.

Over the last 3 weeks which is when her brother fell ill, my mother in law has been calling almost daily. It's not an issue for me as she is grieving and I am happy to be an ear. She first started calling to inform us her brother was in hospital. Then to update his condition which led to letting us know he was being taken off of life support and his eventual passing. Since then it has been calls of worry concerning how to handle the burden of handling his estate and her mother that have progressed in calls of complaints about everything from having to cover the funeral arrangements to aggravation over her mother's behavior. I admit that most of her venting is valid in my opinion, as all involved had ample time to get their affairs in order, seek help with care, or just do something as simple as make a list of important information in the event of their demise.

Today my mother in law called and was complaining because one of her siblings had come to their mother's house and taken her deceased brother's vehicle. I suggested that she contact the police as that is clearly theft and asked if she had considered putting her mother in a home so her mother could have full-time supervision. I was trying to be supportive and help ease my mother in law's stress. Instead my mother in law became irate and accused me of not caring about her or her family and saying I was keeping my partner away from his family. She said I was a terrible daughter in law for not even sending her a condolence card. She then hung up and would not take the call when I called her back.

My partner has said to leave it be so I am doing so. I understand she lashed out and took whatever angle she could in order to try to make me feel bad since her estrangement with her son was before he even met me. I am only worried about the condolence card. I know this is silly but it is bothering me nonetheless. I was taught that condolences were for the family and in my mind my partner and I are part of that family. While in theory we could have sent her mother a card her mother is not always able to remember that her son has passed away. Her mother also does not know who I am and thinks my partner is a child at most times. I want to eventually repair this rift with my mother in law and I want to acknowledge any mistakes I have made.

Please advise"
110,"Hi all, I'm the one who's JNMIL flipped out over the TDAP and who's JY/NMOM brought a friend to my delivery.

Not huge but annoying, JNMIL came over the other day to pick up DS and made some annoying amd typical JustNo comments, I'll bulletpoint

· saying she couldn't wait to watch LO and have a girls day, whining to her (LO) that we won't let her (JNMIL) watch her yet and we should really get out soon for time to ourselves

· (LO kept looking at me and smiling while JNMIL was holding her) ""she's just attached to you cuz you're food""

· she apparently told SO that she's a total daddy's girl on the phone and said if I wanted my LO to be closer to me I ""should've had a boy first cuz girls are closer to their dads and boys are always closer to their mom's"" (way to show your jocosta, I told SO that was projection since she wanted him to be a mommas boy)

· I handed LO to SO and but then wanted her back and JNMIL commented yet again that shes a daddy's girl and I couldn't take her from him (not exact words, something to that affect)

Some more annoying BEC stuff before leaving but nothing huge

My own mother, has been doing the ""my baby"" thing, what she actually says is ""my teenie"" because that's what we refer to LO as, so she'll call and ask ""how's my teenie"" to which I immediately reply ""MY teenie's doing great."" I was fine just correcting her but today she complained saying ""you know what I mean, I don't mean it the way you're taking it, i know she's yours, just let me say it."" No? I said ""NO, you know I don't like it, I've already told you that."" Sometimes when I correct her I say ""GRAND teenie"" and say that's what she can call her. She says that's a mouthful. BEC? Red flag? I don't know, just incredibly annoying."
111,"I was 21 when I started dating my SO (M/30), he was upfront and honest about having a kid (3 years old at the time), but that he's baby mama was crazy (which I took with a grain of salt, because everyone says that). 

My future MIL was nice and we hung out a lot, which was cool since my mom was a bitch (whole other Reddit group). When my SO and I had been dating for 3 months, his mother took me out to lunch, because she had something important to discuss with me. 

I was a bit confused, but ok. During lunch she launched into how my SO's ex was horrible and how she wanted ME to hire a lawyer and a PI to get her precious granddaughter away from his baby mama. Also, she told me it was now my responsibility to pay my SO's child support.

I was like WTF? I asked her, why didn't she pay to do it? (Since my SO's parents were much better of than a full time student/part time job)

It was than that I realized her obsession over my SO's daughter. This woman would do anything to have a girl, since my SO only had brothers.

I should have seen it as a red flag, but I was young and dumb....to be continued"
112,"Okay so my FMIL lives in the same apartment complex as us to help with the baby because we ""obviously"" wouldn't have been able to do it on our own.

She brought a cat and dog with her but only paud for one pet deposit because god forbid she paid the extra $250 for the cat. 

Since she didn't pay it she gets extra scared whenever maintenance has to come over to her apartment and sometimes just drives them all around town to avoid them ever seeing the cat. I said I don't really think she cared but she said it wasn't worth it since it can result in an automatic eviction

So maintenance had to go to her apartment and my fiance came back from work early and saw the cat was in our apartment (in a crate) and the dog was on the balcony with his sister (14). 

We have told her in the past that we don't want the dog especially in our apartment because call me heartless but 1. I don't like dogs, and 2. This dog is either not trained well or not walked enough. 

My fiance was surprised to see the pets and asked me if she had told me that she was going to do that. I said no and we were both upset. He talked to her about it today and I got a message from him saying it didn't go well and she didn't ""get it"" 

If she's so worried about eviction I'm not sure why she would bring her pets to my apartment that have no pets on record. Also while this was going on she told my fiance she would have done our dishes but didn't want to impose.

I'll post an update once I get the full story."
113,"So, I decided to apply to nursing school today. It’s been on my mind for a long time. I have spent so much time in hospitals and I’ve always been interested in the field that I think I could be very empathetic. I’d love to work in women’s health because of my 15 years fighting Endometriosis and reproductive cancer. I found out about some grants that I qualify for that would greatly reduce the cost. I talked to the school today and started a bunch of the paperwork so I can hopefully start in the spring. 

I got to one of the questions for a background check for a federal grants and it asked if I had ever been involved with CPS. Thanks to my Just No’s, I have. They filed a false report 4 years ago when they were furious with me. I told them to stop giving me unsolicited advice and they went nuclear. I hired an attorney at the time and had to go through a 3 month investigation. I was 15 weeks pregnant, had HG and had a PICC line in. It was a bad time. We were found not at fault and no actions were taken against us.

But now I am freaking the eff out. Are these idiots going to get the last word and ruin my life?! I’m so stressed now. My lawyer told me at the time it should not be an issue in the future but I 100% understand why they have to be extremely cautious in the medical field when you’re working with vulnerable people. I was so excited and had this glimmer of hope that I could help people and do something I may actually be good at but now I’m terrified that these people are just going to through another road block into my happiness and future."
114,"So I am 24 weeks pregnant with a little boy. 
Since the beginning of my pregnancy, before we found out the gender, my MIL has said how she had a dream in the month of April that I would have a little girl. (I became pregnant in may) 
The moment we told her I was pregnant she demanded the child must be named after her Mother, Louis and the middle name must be April because that’s when she “dreamed” of me getting pregnant. Going back and fourth me and my SO decided on a girl name for the baby just in case it was female &amp; when my SO told my MIL the name we decided on, she sobbed and pleaded with him over the phone to name it the name she had picked out because “nobody has honored her mother before.” And she “dreamed of this baby.” Yikes
Eventually we found out it was a little boy. And now the new thing is she wants it named after herself (gender neutral name) or a name from the Bible and will constantly talk about names and be picking out first and middle names and I’m just like....no sorry. 
She also has not asked me but she is under the impression that she is throwing me a baby shower in the month of January literally days before I give birth (she lives out of state) and wants to fly out early enough to throw a baby shower for me even though I have made it very clear with her and my SO that I do not want one at all. And will also be staying for 2 months and has hinted at staying at our home for the time being to “help out and clean up and help with cooking”  when she always stays with my BIL because she owns his house. 
Am I overreacting? I don’t want to name my child anything she recommends, I do not want this woman throwing me a baby shower because 1) she really doesn’t know my style or what I like 2) I really just do not want one at all because we don’t have a need for anything. And I also do not want her staying in our home fresh after me giving birth to “help around the house” I want to enjoy being a new mom and figure things out for myself. She never asks me anything she always runs straight to my SO to ask his permission, which he never really gives her a direct answer, which I feel leads her on to think these things are okay. She also already has a grandchild from my BIL which she somehow got to take to the state which she lives for 3 weeks and has spoken about her being excited to bring my child there which WILL NOT HAPPEN. And refers to herself as grand-mommy and calls the grandchild her baby which just kind of makes me sick to my stomach. Is this woman just overly excited?? Am I overreacting??  Or is this behavior a little bit crazy?? My spouse thinks I just hate his mother which is why I don’t speak much about it out loud, I don’t hate her. I just think how she is acting is a little overbearing..."
115,"So about 3 months back I was carrying about 3 large items down the stairs after my girlfriends mums voice screaming down the house to take the three things down all at once, not one by one, but all at once, so to shut her up I did, and about three steps down I’d slipped on a puddle of her drink she’d spilled walking up the same stairs, having no carpet I’d instantly slipped and fallen straight down, dropping all items (mop, black bag filled with rubbish and the hoover) which landed at the bottom of the stairs whilst I landed on a thin sheet metal glass candle holder and dragged a piece of the frame stuck in my leg about 3 steps down until I could finally stop the fall with my hands, the whole thing obviously fell to pieces on impact and left a massive hole in my leg that was bleeding excessively, anyway straight after the fall her mother obviously heard the crashing noises and instantly ran to the aid of... wait for it... the candle, all I could hear whilst my leg was bleeding and I was obviously was in shock is “omg my fucking candle, I can’t believe you’ve done this to my fucking candle, you’re paying every single penny for this” whilst my girlfriend is kicking off that I’d fallen down the stairs and all she’s concerned about is the candle.

Anyway 3 months pass and she’s bought another one, another £85 candle to sit right in the smallest part of the stairs along with the other 6 items sat there leaving barely any room to safely navigate the stairs, and this is where the drama starts, she wants the money for it, the full £85 or else she’s threatening to deliberately smash up my £6000 bike (motorcycle), I’ve asked legal advice and I’m not in no position to pay for something that clearly happened by accident and in fact am entitled to make a claim for personal injury, which I can’t personally be bothered with the stress of currently.

Anyway I’m currently banned from the house which I couldn’t give two fucks about and the woman’s continuing to attempt to place stress on me and my family for the money."
116,"Recently, I was a bridesmaid in a dear friends wedding. She was in my wedding almost a decade ago and we have been close for a long time. My MiL knows who the bride is, and the Bride and I share a first name. This is an important tidbit. 

The wedding was out of  town and so I headed out early morning to get there to get ready. Legit took hours getting ready, between hair, makeup, spanx, making sure everything looked good. My husband joined me for the ceremony and reception while my very JYmom stayed with the kids and pets. 

A friend took a picture of me and my husband that I thought was very lovely. I am not often a fan of pictures of me, but with HOURS of preparation I can look damn good! So i posted this picture to the book of faces captioning it 'Celebrating Bride and Groom', cue comments about how beautiful we looked. 

BitchyBear comments ""who is Groom?"" To which I reply ""brides new husband"". 
3 things to keep in mind: 
1. Bride and I do share a first name. 
2. Bride and Groom have been together for 4 1/2 years
3. BitchyBear knows Bride

BitchyBear responds, ""Which kids did DH get?"" 

Record scratch.

I am livid.

Thankfully I have some wonderful friends who shut her down, commenting how inappropriate it was to make a divorce joke like that and that if that's where she went with it, it's pretty sad that that's how she thinks. One even posted just a link to a definition of Passive Aggressive behavior.  

She responded that since *I* joked first about having a new husband that her joke was perfectly appropriate and that as far as her personal feelings go. ""my son is happy so I am happy"". Uhm. That just means you don't like me, if you did, it wouldn't be a secret!

I have made peace with her not liking me. Or wanting me around. Or considering me family. But! I am not my husband's first wife. Divorce is not something he takes lightly and he definitely has some trauma around the end of his previous marriage, and for her to blatantly disrespect his feelings to joke like that was just rage inducing. 

I calmly responded to her ""I never commented that I had a new husband. I don't refer to myself in the 3rd person. You misunderstood."" And left it at that. 

Ugh."
117,"TW: Physical Abuse mentioned
I've been reading some of the posts on here and I thought I'd share one of my own mother.

I never wanted children, a lot of the reason was my awful childhood at the hands of my mother who was extremely physically abusive, strangling, whipping, telling me she was disappointed I turned out the way I look (after I hit puberty and started looking a lot more like her, she did a 180), explaining her neglect of me as a baby/toddler by telling me I was ""a weird baby"". It also didn't help she always told me to never have children because it made her life miserable.

I have 5 siblings, most of which she abused to varying degrees.

I was with my ex for 6 years and about 4 years in she said I should have a baby with him (I was 21 at the time) because we'd ""have a cute baby"". I told her I was not going to do that and I didn't want children, especially not at that age. 

She kept bringing it up, saying how much she wanted me to have a child and how much she wanted to be a grandmother. I kept saying no.  She even tried convincing me it would help with the severity of my periods.
Eventually she said ""Well...you and (your partner) could just have a baby and give it to me. You wouldn't have to do anything. I just want to have a chance to be a mother again and get it right this time.""
I was disgusted and said ""Absolutely not.""
She kept pressing the issue and then my older brother got his girlfriend pregnant, I thought this would take pressure off me. I said to her ""Well, (older brother) is having a baby now, so you can be a grandmother to his baby when it's born, you'll get what you wanted."" She replied ""I don't want HIS baby. I want YOUR baby because you look so much like me so your baby would look so much like me.""

Suffice to say I haven't spoken to this woman in 3 years and my ex (who I'm still friends with) was always astounded as to how selfish/narcissistic my mother was/is. I always felt so sorry for him for having my mother as his MIL."
118," Hello all! I have been agonizing over posting on this sub for quite awhile now. I created this throwaway account and still had to work up the courage to finally write this post so any support is greatly appreciated. Should mention I am on mobile and also kinda suck at reddit so sorry for any mistakes in advance! This may get long so TLDR at bottom

To set the scene: my husband and I have been together for 14 years, married the last 4.  We started dating in early high school so MIL has been a regular fixture in our lives from the very beginning. I did not always know she would be a JNMIL but recent years have shown her true colors. 

A little background on my JNMIL-she was not a great mother. She divorced my FIL when my husband was a toddler and never provided a stable home for him and his older sister. Not only were they subjected to emotional and mental abuse growing up, they were introduced to a parade of shitty boyfriends, witnessed years of drug use, and to top it all off, regularly were kicked out of multiple homes and spent much of their childhood couch surfing. 

Despite all this, my husband turned out to be an amazing and well adjusted adult. He lived for his weekends at his dad’s house which was the only time he really felt safe and happy and eventually the time he spent with my family. Even knowing all this, I have always tried to have a good relationship with my JNMIL because I knew my husband loves her. 

For the first several years, my attempts worked and I celebrated thinking maybe all would be ok! We all know I wouldn’t be here if the story ended there. Her behavior didn’t really become a huge problem until around the time we became engaged. I have too many stories to tell in one post but would be happy to share if anyone is interested in reading later...

For now my main problem is advice moving forward. Recent events have lead me to be NC with her for the last 10 months and for my husband to be VLC. The issue I’m facing currently is that my daughter’s first birthday is coming up next month and I’m torn on what to do. Without going into too much detail, my JNMIL has managed to ruin several major life events in the past and if given the opportunity, I’m sure she will continue this tradition in the future. My husband and I have decided to celebrate our daughter’s first birthday with two small get togethers, one with each of our families. Nothing major since she won’t really remember but just a chance to spend time with family and celebrate our wonderful little girl. 

I have made it clear to my husband that his mother is no longer welcome at our home and that if he wanted his mother present for his family party, that it would need to be held at a public space. Over the weekend, he brought our daughter to visit his mother for the first time in 10 months to tell her about a possible job relocation we are considering across the country and after this visit it was clear to me he wanted to make more of an effort with her as she was apparently so good with our daughter. 

For the sake of my marriage I do not feel it is my place to dictate my husband’s relationship with his mother even if I choose to be NC (which he fully supports). However I am riddled with anxiety over this party and having to be in the same room as her. What I am really looking for is advice on how to best navigate this situation. The party is less than a month away and I need your help to prepare myself on how to best handle the situation. Also after I post more backstory on her maybe y’all can help me come up with a good nickname! 

TLDR: Have been NC with my JNMIL for 10 months. Throwing my daughter a first birthday party where JNMIL will be in attendance, how can I handle this situation?"
119,"Tw: talk of attempted suicide, drugs, and drug abuse
(in description #6)

I spent the last two years casually dating around, enjoying being single after a 10yr relationship/marriage. I wasn't looking for a relationship, and as it goes, that's when I found one.

My girlfriend is awesome. And like typical lesbians we are living up to some stereotypes (like living together after just a few months). Two important things, this is her first ""in person"" relationship. The others were all online, long distance. Second, she has a large family that is all very, very close. Several of them even live in the same house (like immediate and extended family, multi generations). I do not have a large or close family. I am mostly NC with most of my immediate and extended family. My most interaction with my family is the very occasional Facebook like. I haven't had a mom since I was a kid, so moms are always a little more difficult for me to understand than other family members.

So here is my query for y'all. I want to be prepared for how to handle her family. Particularly her mom. I've had a few justnomils over the years, and if this is going to be the case again, imma need a shammy to shiny up my spine.

Below are some things I have noticed that I'm not sure are red flags or yellow flags or if I'm just worrying after reading so much justnomil and unpleasant memories from the ex-justnomils of my own. 

1. Gf says that until recently she was the SG and her brother was the GC. It was only when the brother tossed all of the moms hoarding in the trash that he was no longer the GC. (Long explanation: mom gave brother the house on the stipulation that he 1. Feed the numerous cats she has inside/outside, 2. Help her move all of her hoarded stuff to her new home. Brother does neither. After two years of living in the house and none of her stuff being moved because she was always busy, he tosses it all to the curb. He continues to feed 1 cat and says the others can fend for themselves, he has kicked all the inside cats outside as well. Hes a justno on his own.) Now she is the sort of GC, and her brother is vvvlc with his mom.


2. Mom is a hoarder. This has happened across multiple homes shes lived in. I've been told by their other family members that at previous houses the hoarding was so bad the house couldn't be walked through. There have been allusions to the hoarding having caused a fire that burned down their vacation home. 

She has some hoarding with animals as well. Not just the now abandoned cats at the house the brother lives in. She currently has a couple dogs and cats at her new home. The animals that live with her get proper vet care, and are well looked after. They only live in her room though, which seems unfair to the animals.

Currently, her hoarded stuff is clean and kind of organized now. She lives with several family members and no longer works. She seems to keep it to her bedroom but it is packed in there. Its clean, theres just a TON of stuff. Shes always adding more. She absolutely loves to shop at thrift stores and dollar stores and frequently brings home ""hauls"" of just random stuff that ""someone could use"" or thing to add to her various collections. It drives the family members that live in the same house nuts.

When I helped my gf move I made her sort through multiple tubs and boxes of filthy, pee smelling clothes and miscellaneous junk that her mom had given to her that she had been avoiding dealing with. She has tried to give us stuff when my gf visits. Either she says it's my gf's stuff for her to sort through or she bought it and thought gf may want it. Apparently she wanted to give us a bunch of stuff when we moved in together but I already have a fully furnished home. Her mom made sure to stipulate it was all clean and in working condition. I had told my gf to not accept or bring anything here that's given to her, I have too much stuff already. She told her mom we don't need anything, thankfully her mom accepted that. 

3. Like so many, many moms it seems, her mom doesn't like anyone she dates. But, she likes me. Apparently I'm a good influence? We're both past our 20s, well past ""influence"" age. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop with this. In my experience, if a mom usually doesn't like someone's SO's, at some point they won't like me either. 

Her reasons for disliking the ex's include: making my gf depressed because they broke up, being mean and a bad influence, and being manipulative (that one I can agree with). 

4. My gf bought us matching rings as a gift. They're just matching non precious metal bands. They don't mean any more than ""we're in a committed, monogamous relationship"". But I can see how someone would assume more, since they're on our left hands, ring fingers. Her mom saw hers a few weeks ago and asked about it when we three were talking. (I had put mine on a different finger to avoid any assumptions). My gf said it was just a ring. A few days ago her mom asked again, in front of their family, what the rings ment. (I had mine on a different finger again). My gf said they just mean ""I love you"". Her mom said ""well I need to know. I'm not paying for a wedding dress..."" she trailed off then left the room. It was said sort of... sarcastic jokingly? Everyone else was kind of laughing but it was clearly awkward all around. I felt very put on the spot.

5. A couple days before the 2nd questioning about the rings, my gf got a panicked call from her sibling. Her family was upset and freaking out. Her 5 year old nibling was bawling. Apparently her mom told everyone we moved out of state because my gf hadn't called all week and hadn't visited in two weeks. Wtf?? Yes, we are planning on moving in about 4 months, which she knows. Why the hell would she freak everyone out and make my gfs fave nibling cry?? This made literally no sense. Her explanation? ""Well I haven't heard from you"". 

6. About ten years ago, my gf had a really shitty two faced roommate. The roommate was putting sleep meds/psych meds in my gfs food daily so she would sleep more. This allowed the roommate to do/deal drugs while my gf was asleep. The meds made my gf out of it and not mentally stable. Eventually her irrational mental state from these meds drove most of her family away. She finally discovered what her roommate was doing and kicked her out. Two weeks later, due to multiple unforseen circumstances, my gf tried to take her own life. She was at her moms house during this. Her mom helped her get to the hospital. Her mom then told everyone at the hospital that her daughter was an extensive illegal drug user and incredibly promiscuous. She was trying to get her daughter committed. These are the lies she thought would get a person put in a mental institution. Because the hold they put my gf on for her suicide attempt wasn't long enough (24hrs), and she wanted her to be kept there for at least a week. She thought that if her daughter was there at least a week then she would stop hanging out with ""bad influences"" like her roommate and behave. My gf forgives her mom for this because ""her heart was in the right place"", even though the lies really hurt her feelings.

I know this was super long. I'll happily take suggestions about how to/not to behave and talk around her mom. If you think any of these are red flags and have suggestions on what to watch out for, excellent. Since I'm nc with most of my family and don't have a mom, navigating her large family is new for me and makes me nervous I'm going to screw up. I hope I'm just reading too much into all this. Am I??

Edited to add: my gf insists that we lie about how we met (a dating app online) and until today wanted me to lie about my religion. Because how her mom views internet dating, the internet in general, and paganism."
120,"tl;dr Orphan Mom is told she's dying by an ER doctor, tells anyone who'll listen and gluttonously feeds on the sympathy, then later finds out that isn't true and now wants to sue that doctor for ""pain and suffering"" and malpractice and anything else she can pull out of her ass.

\-----------------------------

Hello all, been awhile since I posted.  I enjoyed the summer break from school with the youngest nerdling, JNMom contact-free and things seemed to be going just swimmingly.  But unfortunately all good things must come to an end, or I wouldn't be back here, huh?

Just before school started back for the nerdling, I got several late evening panicky phone calls from family members.  Orphan Mom (hereafter referred to as OM cause laziness) was in the Emergency Room of a hospital near her home with chest pains and severe nausea.  Youngest Brother (YB) was on his way there and promised to keep me updated.  Tests were run, meds were administered, and a stress test was scheduled for the next morning.  OM then insisted on being transferred to another hospital since that hospital was where her cardiologist practiced out of.

**Here's the meat of the post:**  Before she was transferred, a hospitalist/generalist doctor at the first hospital told OM *and* YB that OM had a 95% blockage in one cardiac artery and since it was so close to other vessels that already had stints, it was too dangerous to stint this one.  He told them there was nothing anyone could do to help OM, she needed to get her affairs in order and decide on her final arrangements because she wouldn't live much longer.  YB called me and informed me of this, saying I needed to come to terms with it because it sounded inevitable.  For once the info was shared with someone other than just OM, so it seemed to have some backing in reality (as opposed to all the shit OM says that happens with no witnesses, to attempt to glom sympathy off the listener).  As soon as the doctor was out of earshot, OM pulls out her cell phone and starts calling family, friends, neighbors and anyone else she has a number for and telling them the doctors say she's dying.

Later that night she's transported to the other hospital, where they decide to skip the stress test and go straight to a heart cath.  She never saw or spoke to her own cardiologist while there.  All test results come back normal, including the heart cath not finding major blockages.  However she does NOT crank up the cell phone this time to inform everyone that her death bed was not quite made for her yet, as she's continuing to bask in the sympathy.  As far as I know, to this day everyone except YB and myself thinks she's gonna kick the bucket any minute now.

**And for the kicker:**  OM is now ""furious"" that doctor told her she was dying and nothing could be done, despite her milking it for all it's worth.  She wants to make him pay, sue him for malpractice and pain and suffering and anything else she can tack on.  But only a few immediate family members know this, because telling anyone else would cut off her Vulnerable Narcissist feed of pity and sympathy.  

I wish I could say I went back NC with OM after learning she wasn't dying after all.  It's very much what I wanted to do.  But YB asked me for a favor so he could get away a few days and spend time with a friend.  And as he's done all the heavy lifting in regards to OM since he lives near her, and it's pretty much taken over his entire life, I agreed for his sake.  That story in a post to come soon, when I have the time and energy to type it out.

Thanks for reading.  Much love to you all."
121,"For some background, my mom is a raging narc. I have only been out of the fog for about two years now. She has never physically hurt me, and she doesn't seem to be quite as intense as some others on this sub. But I had to vent.

My husband and I have started a farm! We are excited for what the future holds, but we are still trying to find a way to move closer to the land so the commute doesn't kill us. I hadn't really spoken to my mom in a good while (maybe 3 weeks?), and I have been oh so happy about that. But then my DH had an idea... You see, my mom has been trying to sell an RV she bought with her late husband a while ago. She tried to pawn it off on my sister but she wouldn't have been able to make the payment. The sad truth is that my sister actually didn't want it because my mother had three cats all living in the camper and one constantly peed everywhere. She was still trying to get the ammonia smell out but figured that could just be my sister's problem. Luckily, my sister is no longer in the fog either.

So this past Sunday, DH asked me what I thought about going back into the lion's den to try and get the camper to use while we figure out the living situation at the farm. My mom had recently told us that she replaced the sofa cushions that had been peed on for the last year, so I reluctantly said I would ask her if she still had it. Cue instant anxiety. I texted her and said we would love to take the payment off her hands and use it on the farm. She texts back saying she had literally just taken it to the dealership to try and sell it. OK, no big deal. We were upset but understanding. She then says she would call the guy the next morning and see if it's too late, but not before telling us she had spent $300 that she won't get back for detailing the camper if we take it...

Monday morning, I get an email saying that she is stuck in the contract per the man at the dealership, but that she was going to try her best to see if she couldn't get him to give it back so we could use it. She said over and over again that she thinks she can get him to end the contract since he's her friend and that she really wants to be able to help us. I thought, *wow, that's nice that she's actually trying*. LOL

About four hours later I get an email asking me to call her. My phone is broken, so I said I wouldn't be able to call. I then get this email this morning:

""I just wanted to tell you at 4 pm yesterday I signed over the camper. It’s gone. I’m in shock. Still. I’ve worried about selling it for so long, it’s gonna take me a bit to accept it. Hope you have a great day!"" \*smiley face with hearts\*

I was stunned. And angry, but mainly at myself for being surprised. There was absolutely no mention of her not being able to end the contract or anything like, ""Sorry I couldn't help after all."" Nothing. I suppose she just wanted me to act like our previous conversations had never happened and be overjoyed for her. And to think, I was shopping for her birthday present when she sent that. Hope you like no contact for your birthday, Mama. It's the one gift you truly deserve."
122,"So this isn't directly about me, but it kind of is? I'm just at a bit of a crossroads and could use some advice. 

So, backstory, I have 3 siblings, 1 sister and 2 brothers. We grew up with a JN mom that had/has anger management issues, and some definite narc qualities. My oldest sister, JYSIS, 31, got the brunt of a lot of abuse within our childhood home. She left the state and became NC with our mom about 6 years ago now. She keeps in contact with our dad and brothers, and I like to think we're pretty close. We've all tried really hard to respect the NC and we don't pressure her on it or anything. I absolutely think it's justified. 

The issue is, of course, a wedding. My younger brother got married last year, and JYSIS didn't go because our JNMom went. We tried to find a compromise (having a big and a small reception, one for each persons, my other brother and I forming a bodyguard circle for JYSIS, a personal sibling celebration), but we couldn't agree on any of those things. So, JYSIS didn't go and JNMom did. 

Now, I'm engaged to be married next year. My mom is offering to pay a substantial amount for the wedding, so I don't want to uninvite her, but I also absolutely want my JYSIS in my bridal party. I've talked to JYSIS about it, and she just keeps repeating ""I'm not going to make you choose, but if JNMom goes, I won't be there."" All I can figure is that I'm obviously left with a choice of SIS or Mom. I would much rather have JYSIS, but if I disinvite JNMom, it will more than likely cause a rift akin to NC between us. 

So, I would love any and all advice on what I can do in this situation. If any of you have been in JYSIS' position, what would you have wanted to hear from your sibling? Please help!"
123,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m hoping writing some of this down will help me to get it off my chest and be able to be less annoyed. 

I’m currently pregnant and this seems to be when MIL really dials up the BEC behavior. My DH has a shiny spine but also some level of respect for his mother so he tries to reserve its use only when necessary. 

Background on one of those times when he had to flex his shiny spine: when I was pregnant with our first, MIL sent us an insane email after finding out what name we had chosen. To summarize: some long dead relative had the same name that her own mother had thought was “unrefined”. DH shut that nonsense down immediately and she apologized quickly thereafter. 

So you would think she would learn her lesson that we don’t want her input on baby names? Negative. 

During her last visit my own dad let the name slip that we have been throwing around. MIL didn’t bring it up or comment on it in the moment so I stupidly thought yay, she’s evolved. Wrong.

During this visit she must have also seen this small item I bought with a variation of the name written on it in another language. But still very easily discernible as the same name. I’ll just say the item said “Maria” and the name we picked was “Mary”. I bought it for my husband to help persuade him into this name choice.

Roughly two weeks later, apropos of nothing, she texts both of us “oh I forgot to ask you, i saw (the item). What does ‘Maria’ signify?”

I also later find out from my own mother she cornered her alone that same day my dad slipped and asked her if we had decided on names and my mom (knowing full well MIL heard my dad slip) said we had been throwing around Mary. 

I can’t. Both my husband and I never responded to her text. I know it’s rude to not respond at all but it’s honestly the best way to handle her. I’m a bad liar and we don’t want to play her game."
124,"With me getting excited and starting to plan for American Thanksgiving, I want to regale you of last year's Thanksgiving story. This turned out really long, so thank you if you stick it out!

Notes

* JYSIL is MIL's GC, DH fades between SG and Lost Child. 

* DH and I have known each other more than half our lives. I have never liked MIL.

* Last Thanksgiving, I was 8 months pregnant with our first kiddo.

My MIL used to do Thanksgiving at her house after the aunt who used to run the holiday got too old to do so. The last time MIL did Thanksgiving was 2017. She decided to drop the holiday rope for 2018, which is fine. 

JYSIL had moved house with her husband (BIL) and their kiddo. JYSIL thought, ""Well, shoot, I can do it then!"" She realizes she doesn't cook much, but DH and I cook a lot. Like, I've made the entire Thanksgiving spread *by myself* for a 10-15 person Friends-giving twice.  I only stopped doing it because when I say, ""Anyone coming, please bring a side,"" I do not mean only bring beer or cranberries so I can make you cranberry sauce. But, I digress. 

Long story short, when SIL asks for help, I jump on it. Dinner for 15 to 20 people? Let's do this!

DH and I threw ourselves into it. We tested about 5 or 6 batches of our Punpkin Rolls, I made my grandmother's Bacon Green Beans, DH brined a turkey, SIL made some amazing stuffing (I wish I could remember what it was called... it had apples in it!). We had a blast. 

Anyway, while cooking, SIL is telling me that MIL and her husband (who I find super creepy) may not even show. Apparently MIL was upset SIL ""stepped on her toes"" and did Thanksgiving anyway. But the fun doesn't stop there!

MIL is livid that SIL and BIL (SIL's husband) invited their best friends, a very nice married couple. Never mind that BIL has known one of them his ENTIRE life. Or that neither of the couple had any family to celebrate with. But it STILL doesn't stop there!

MIL is INCENSED that BIL AND his mom/stepdad are going to be there. MIL says, and I paraphrase because I wasn't there, ""BIL isn't family. Thanksgiving is for FAMILY."" 

Yes, BIL has been to the Thanksgiving that MIL hosted in the past. And yes, this is being hosted at SIL and BIL's house. 

My eyes roll out my head, down the street and to the corner store for some wine I can't even drink. 

Anyway, people start showing up. BIL's mom is an ANGEL and I love her after meeting her exactly once. She also makes amazing desserts and I wish I could apprentice under her. 

MIL and Creepy Husband show up late. Didn't bring anything but themselves. Complain about there not being any ""good alcohol"" in the house. MIL looks me up and down, pats my 8 month belly, and says, ""You look... good,"" with a combination CBF/smile (still kicking myself for not saying anything about her fucking touching me). 

We all get food and sit to eat. And it's all **delicious**. People are going back for thirds! We ran entirely out of rolls (DH and I made 40)! People are picking meat off the turkey bones! 

And MIL has this *horrible* CBF the ENTIRE TIME. MIL can only say, ""Well, I think the turkey is a little dry."" And BIL's mom, bless her, says, ""I'm not sure what you ate, because that was the juiciest turkey I've ever eaten.""

MIL corners SIL during clean up, and says, ""Well. I guess you had it all along,"" and scuttles back to her cave, her creepy husband in tow. 

SIL and I are planning on doing it again this year, and I'm hoping for bigger and better than last year. Especially since SIL is pretty convinced MIL won't want to come again. 🤣

ETA: [Here](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/10/yeasted-pumpkin-bread.html) is the recipe DH and I used for Pumpkin Rolls!"
125,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. We have been unsuccessful in receiving a restraining order.

I've been asked to tell about the significance to TPP and the sleepovers. I honestly don't know, other than she's reaching deep in her book of memories and trying to find something she did that some parents didn't do? I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd have a sleepover a few times a year, with 4-6 (depending on the time) of my very best friends between the ages of 11-14 (when I moved out). I'm not going to lie, they WERE fun. She would take us to TP folks' houses (isn't that ironic), we'd sometimes make virgin margaritas, stuff like that. We'd do hair and makeup and we weren't allowed to use hot tools without her, because dangerous?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still friends with all of those girls (now women, we range from 28-30). We've discussed those sleepovers often-they WERE fun. But also very, very controlled. My dad would have to send money for food/snacks/a movie rental/even the cheap $.88 great value toilet paper. She was basically up our asses constantly. We all had our own phones (back in the day of the Nokia) but if we prank called boys we HAD to tell her and she HAD to be in the room. Don't know why. She yelled a lot, including to my friends. Would tell us our messes must be picked up IMMEDIATELY or it was disrespectful to her, even if we were still participating in said mess. If we went to my room away from her, she'd almost always call to me that I needed to do this chore or that chore. If we went to the mall, or Walmart, or wherever (remember, preteens), she'd pull me aside and constantly fuss that we weren't supposed to be holding hands, or touching, or any of the sort because then people would say we were gay.

&amp;#x200B;

But her ABSOLUTE favorite thing in the world was to make me wash my hair. 99.9% of the time, it was a Friday night. Meaning I had absolutely nothing to do on Saturdays besides, be at home. But no. We'd be in the middle of makeup, or a game, or just hanging out and doing what teen girls do and inevitably, TPP would barge in and tell me to go wash my hair NOW, it was oily and made me look like a (racial slur).

&amp;#x200B;

I have long, thick hair. SUPER thick. It takes 1.5 hours to try by blow dryer or about 8 air drying. Washing it is an ordeal. Why did I need to leave my friends and my sleepover to go wash my hair RIGHT THAT INSTANT? I don't really know, but it was EVERY. Single. Time. I'd be forced to go freaking wash my hair. Then, even though I NEVER blow dried it, I'd have to go downstairs with HER so she could spend an hour and a half blow drying my hair. EVERY. Single. Time. She loved to isolate me from my friends, even at these sleepovers (there will be more posts about this, but isolating me is her go to, and I'm not sure why.)

&amp;#x200B;

Then, 11 would roll around and she'd tell us to go to bed or she was taking everybody home. Because she was tired and couldn't watch us. Remember, 11-14 years old here, security system on the doors. She didn't need to watch us. But she heard us ONE time and took everybody home at 12:30. Because, she needed her sleep. (we were upstairs. She was down.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really understood her obsession since I grew up about the sleepovers, except to theorize that that's all she has. When I was 14, I moved out (she had me placed under house arrest, which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dbpdv5/tp_patrol_and_when_i_moved_out_at_14/).) So the better part of my high school career, she wasn't there. I was a cheerleader at my new school and she only came to one pep rally, no games. I went to only my junior prom, which I got my hair and makeup done professionally because she refused to help ""enable me"" (I'd invited her to come with me and my aunt-who was paying-to pick out a prom dress. I found one i absolutely LOVED. It was a size too small, but with a corset back put in it was PERFECT. She walked into the dress salon (LATE, by about 45 minutes), saw the dress, saw them pinning the zipper because again, was having a corset put in, and screamed at me that it looked ridiculous and I was trying to be skinny and I wasn't. I was lazy and needed to lose weight, and that dress looked HORRIBLE! And promptly walked back out. So, she refused to help me get ready for prom because she didn't want to enable me thinking I was skinny? She did show up at prom presentation for all of 15 minutes to get pictures to play mom of the year then dipped out. I didn't go to senior prom at all.

&amp;#x200B;

She refused to help me pick out my homecoming dress my senior year when I was on the court, because she didn't want to enable that either. She did show up for homecoming court presentation, got her pics, and left (again, i was CHEERING at that same game). Didn't show up for the senior presentation football game, where all the cheerleaders and football players that were seniors went to the field with their parents and got a rose, a balloon to release, and our letterman's jacket. She was too tired and wasn't coming alone, because her husband worked nights. Screamed at me, took my phone and keys (which my dad promptly took right back and gave them to me in front of her), and told me I was STUPID if I thought a 33 on my ACT was GOOD. That's FAILING, OP. You're not going to get into any colleges!

&amp;#x200B;

She did come to graduation, but was PISSED because I got 4 seats in the parent's area, and I gave them to dad, my aunt (who is like a mother to me!), her, and her husband, and presented both her and my aunt with a rose which was meant for the mother/mother figures. My aunt DIDN'T DESERVE A ROSE! How dare you! Then she tried to take my keys AGAIN because i said I'd rather not go to eat with her and her mother?my aunts and uncles on her side, I had plans. Which, I did. And dad promptly gave me back my keys. Oh, and she also refused to help me move into college because ""I wasn't listening to her and was being disrespectful."" Why, do you ask? She said I was stupid for buying new things for my dorm and it was a waste of money (not hers) and demanded I return it, and if I didn't she wasn't helping me. (I didn't need her help. My dad and aunt helped me). Basically her pattern is ""do what i say"", then throw a fit when I don't let her control and isolate me, and finally, go silent for a month or two then go right back to demanding again.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, that's the story about the sleepovers. It's not much."
126,"Hello all, I have recently posted about jnfmil and how I narrowly avoided having to spend our 5 year anniversary weekend at her home, as a way to save money on hotels, thanks to advice and support from this forum.

We had to cancel the hotel due to funds and unexpected problems but ended up going out 2 days later for our anniversary meal and WOAH!!! BF proposed to me and we are now engaged, getting wed next summer :)

Anyway. Here's the thing. FDH really wants to tell jnfmil in person. He told his dad over the phone but he feels he must tell her in person and has twisted my arm into going there next Wednesday for the day. He has a delicate and heavy package to send out to his home town so figures we could hand deliver it. 

He brought this up three times before I caved. The third occasion he got me in a good mood.

Jnfmil is a narc, highly judgemental, shallow, mean spirited, passive aggressive, OCD and controlling. And thinks her son is the golden child.

I am a recovering people pleaser, I had abusive parents and she can be EXTREMELY triggering for me.

FDH says if she is awful, we can just leave, but he wants to give her a chance to be supportive and congratulatory. 

FDH has seen how upset I have been and how nasty she has been but seems to think she is capable of being genuinely nice and supportive. I am extremely wary and worry that my body language will give away how tense and ill at ease I am and that will anger her.

I believe she will lose the plot about something and that will break FDH heart. 

What coping techniques can I use to get through the day? 

Thanks all. :)"
127,"How long did people generally put up with toxic behaviour (MIL, SIL, JNMOM) before going NC?
Every interaction with in laws especially MIL and SIL ends negatively whether subtle or catastrophic. I never leave feeling happy or positive after seeing or speaking to either of them?"
128,"Tw: eating disorders

A little backstory: I (20f) am currently living with my mom (M), my husband (21m), daughter (10months), and dad (D). I am trying to lose weight for a breast reduction surgery, and have a history of anorexia and binge/purge patterns. I am not working, as my back pain is too great, DH works full time, M doesn't work, and D is an over the road truck driver who is only home weekends. We live in a ""modular home"" which is a fancy way to say trailer. We have MANY animals. Sorry if it rambles I'm new to reddit I haven't posted much.

Back during my pregnancy, M was SUPER involved, like expecting to be there when baby is delivered without even asking involved. I have anxiety and trouble with confrontation, so I just rolled with it. We found out about pregnancy troubles, and M starts bawling and screaming, leaving me, the pregnant lady who was told she has a very slim chance of birthing my baby, to be the strong one (DH was at work). End up going to a hospital 2 hours away, and M said she would go with but only went once and left quickly thereafter. FIL took us most of the time, as D was over the road and DH didn't have the greatest car at the time. DD makes it, and M keeps saying how she wishes DD would be born on my grandmother's birthday, even though she knows that I wasn't on speaking terms with her. M is in the delivery room as I'm induced, and keeps asking DH to go get things (food, drink, etc) as she wants to be there for the birth. DH has no trouble with conflict, and says he will be here when it happens, and it wasn't happening anytime soon. DD is born, and M is RIGHT up in there watching it all. I'm more worried about my baby being taken to the NICU without me even holding her than M being all up near my coochie, but DH thinks it's kinda odd. After DD is born, M stays for a few more hours then leaves. I am left in the hospital for 3 days, mostly alone, without my baby. I start trying to pump, it goes well, suddenly DD doesn't want to breastfeed. I hadn't been taking my antidepressants while pregnant, and only just started them and my emotions were horrible and I started a downward depression spiral where M would chastise me and say that me being upset will only make the baby upset and then take DD from me. DH helped me and she stopped taking DD from me, but would still yell at me to stop crying. I had severe separation anxiety from DD, and M would get angry with me whenever I asked for her back. 

Now up to the past few months, where I've been trying to lose weight. As stated, I have a binge/purge pattern and a history of anorexia. During the breastfeeding debacle I was on my binge/purge until DH noticed and got me help. I had tried many different doctors, many different therapies, and many different meds for my back pain, some of which have royally screwed with my memory. After getting the ok from insurance to go to a plastic surgeon with a referral from my doctor, i am on the road to surgery, but need to lose weight. DH is very supportive, but D has always been a man who asks if you want/need anything, if he gets one for him he gets one for you, etc. That pattern has been hard to break but I genuinely believe hes trying. Now, M on the other hand, is the one DH thinks is trying to sabotage my progress and she is also a heavy set woman and DH thinks all shes doing is because she cant lose weight. She offers me candy, says I can have a cheat day many days in a row, when buying food always get the greasy foods, the fatty foods, etc with no mention of maybe a salad or grilled instead of fried. She buys me ""presents"" of my favorite snack or soda. Tells me shes lost so much weight and her pants are loose and shes not even really trying. Buys lunch for us and eats half of hers and gives the rest to me, knowing I dont like wasting food. This leads me to be very depressed, thinking my progress is halted, it's not working, yadda yadda yadda. I dont know how to cope with this feeling, so I binge. After I binge I'm so sick of myself physically and emotionally that I purge. Lately I've had that cooled down, but now I've begun to notice, as DH asks me what I ate that day, I've only been eating light salads, or some days not at all, and im afraid I may be relapsing. DH is angry with M for making me feel this way, but as he doesn't want her taking anything out on me, he doesn't say anything. 

At random times, M will get angry and not tell us (me and DH) why. She will ignore us for multiple days until she blows up and yells at us, we tell her to talk to us instead of yelling, she tells more, we yells, and she gets more angry for us yelling. She often gets angry at DH for not doing something hes supposed to, or something she asked him to do, which is fair, but she doesn't tell him about it. She complains to me, and I'm in the middle of them both complaining about each other. 

I'm not sure what to do or think. I can see some of DH's points, but I also know that sometimes she can be really nice. I had DH help me with the list of things, because I dont quite remember everything."
129,"I (35F) have already decided to divorce my husband(34M) over how spineless he is, and how he failed to protect me during my postpartum period where my ILs stayed with us for months. However we are still living together so that we can co-parent since the baby is still less than a year old and we are committed to stay cordial.

My MIL has been rude since day 1 of meeting her. She is narcissistic, rude, cannot stop talking about herself and how great she is, and every conversation is to show off how much money she has. (Her all time hall of fame story in my book is how she spins the story of how she hit a motorist, causing him to be handicapped for life, into a story of how she saved a poor kid with no money, paying for his medical bills and getting him treated with her amazing connection to top surgeons). 

I really tried to brush it off before, even when she was rude to my mom, telling myself that she meant well, “that’s just how she talks”, and reminding myself that at least she doesn’t live in the same city. But ever since the birth of my son, somehow my existence threatened hers as the only mother in her household, she’s been extra abusive towards me. During my recovery from childbirth, she would forbid me from holding my son, grab my crying son away from my arms without asking, telling me how I don’t know what I’m doing and I should go back to bed and focus on pumping. She also made me pump instead of breastfeed so she can feed the baby herself. She would pass my baby around to everyone (my husband, SIL, BIL, FIL - yes that was how many ILs who stayed in my house during my postpartum period), but refused to let me hold my son. My husband had to sneak the baby into my room so that I could hold him. I was a mess, crying in my room constantly and wishing they would leave. There are too many horror stories. Maybe one day I’ll share.

Fast forward to now, almost a year later and slowing growing my own spine (100% thanks to finding this sub. Thank you guys so much😭), since husband will probably never grow one. I have stopped politely replying in their family chat room, and as of yesterday, I finally left the chat room (sounds silly but felt huge to me). I have told husband if they ever visit again I will be going to a hotel and he will be responsible to serve them 24/7 while taking care of our son. Even though it’s obvious we are getting divorced due to his “family dynamics”, my MIL has never been confronted that she is the cause of this. Knowing her, she probably blames me for being an ungrateful wife and leaving her golden child and causing her not being able to see her grandchild this holiday season. I personally would like as little contact with her as possible, but I also don’t want to damage the relationship for my son’s sake. What if he grows up enjoying a relationship with his grandparents (MIL does love him and treats him like her own baby), I don’t want to be the person who makes my son choose between anyone when he’s older. 

My question: MIL’s birthday is coming up, and since it’s the most important day in her world, it would be catastrophic if I don’t acknowledge the day and at least send her a happy bday text. But just thinking about doing it makes me feel so sick at myself and how weak I am even after months of self therapy. Should I break NC and send a text? It’s just a simple text, just taking the high road? Should I not let it bother me this much? My anxiety has definitely came back and I haven’t slept well debating this. None of my friends understand my struggle and thinks I should just “play nice”, which I agree to a degree. I’m hoping someone here will understand my pain 😩 The fact that I’m making this a big deal also makes me so angry at myself for giving her the power to affect me."
130,"Tons of venting so I apologize if I get side tracked. My last post gave me some amazing support and feed back from this community and I'm looking for some more wisdom because I feel like I'm taking things too personal. We all came to a compromise and for the sake of keeping things discreet I'll just say that I talked with everyone in my home and we're all on the same page, hopefully, about MIL. She will be staying here but only because my JYparents are amazing and helped me come up with a plan for when she visits. Anyways to the problem I'm having now...

MIL has still not reached out to me personally but she did make a post about having two new granddaughters coming into the world in the next few months. I can't see it since she didn't make it public, she makes EVERY grandchild post public because she has stupid hash tags she likes to use. Now this upset me for a couple of reasons and I'm trying to decide if I'm overreacting or not. 

SO and I have known about our baby since I was 8 weeks along, I'm now 30ish weeks along , we told our families once I was in the 2nd trimester just to be safe. We also decided that only grandparents and us would know the gender because I wanted to keep things neutral. SO and I both made posts and got all the love and support families like to give and when asked about gender SO did an amazing job of letting people know that we were going to wait till LO is born to announce that. 

The other night my SIL showed me the post MIL made about the newest granddaughters she was going to have. She was asked who was having kids and if they're twins by some random family member and her reply was that her sons were going to be fathers, no mention of me or BIL's wife, just her sons will be dads. I already feel like an incubator with SO's family so this didn't help that feeling at all. After this post she messaged my SO about how he needs to reach out to his brother and they need to fix their relationship because they're both becoming fathers and will need each other for support and advice. I'm so happy SO told her to f-off. BIL is a bigger just no than she is and we cut him from our lives completely and I have remained adamant that this man will never be around me or my child. I can deal with rude and bitchy but he's a creep and hateful and just overall too much to handle. 

I feel like she's still doing things to try to bother me and I'm not sure if I'm becoming the just no in this situation. I didn't want to post the gender and it bothers me that her only post about my pregnancy wasn't even about me, it was about her becoming a grandmother and her son becoming a dad. I can't stand how hard she has pushed SO to fix things with BIL and I'm just over my baby being referred to as her grand baby when she hasn't done a single thing or asked how it's going. The tricky part is I don't want a relationship with this woman I just want to enjoy my pregnancy and not worry about her posting things when I can't even see it. SO has agreed to call her and set some boundaries if she really wants to be a grandparent to our baby but I feel like she'll just  break those rules like she does with her daughter's children. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
131,"So I live with my mil, long story short, she’s just kind of dumb sometimes. She means well. But anyways, our washer has had a leak and it caused the floor to bubble up on the other side of the wall(she blamed that on a “spill”) ya one big ass spill that somehow we all missed. So yesterday I’m washing new bedding and the first time I tried, I went to check it and it said “wash”. When the washer is done it has always said “cycle complete” so I’m like wtf? She’s like “oh I turned off the cold water and disconnected it because of the leak, it just says that when you use the hot water but it’s done”. Weird but ok. I dry my first load, carry on with my comforters. This time I new something is definitely up because when I check they were still soapy as fuck. Something is wrong but I haven’t figured it out yet. My dryer load is done, they don’t feel clean like they normally do. I go back to my comforters and still nothing has changed, still soapy as fuck. So I start researching and on the washers very own website it says specifically “HOT AND COLD MUST be hooked up and turned ON in order for the washer to operate correctly and finish a cycle”. So my boyfriend comes home and I tell him what’s up, secretly as I’m not trying to step on his moms toes and make her feel dumb. So because of the leak the washers rinse cycle(it used cold to rinse) won’t work properly due to lack of pressure, so he basically had to manually do it himself. So we finally finish half assed loads of bedding. I told them both what I read on the WASHERS WEBSITE, thinking they would understand. Clearly she didn’t get the memo because today she washed a load of towels. And she thinks they are clean. Like girl they are not rinsed, still full of soap and whatever else dirt was in the load. Idk she just doesn’t accept that things need to be fixed correctly in order to work right. And she always tries to justify big issues with smaller ones, like the bubbly floor from the “spill”. Lmao. My man got the part to fix the washer thank god. His mom is a bird brain sometimes."
132,"I’m back. Unfortunately. I think I may have a JustNoSO on top of a JNMIL. Read my previous post to catch up. TL:DR version: my MIL does not respect me as the mother to my child and I’m afraid my husband thinks that’s okay. 


As of my last post, my husband had suggested no contact with his parents. I struggled with that concept because of abandonment PTSD from my own mother, but through therapy and talking it out, I agreed that, that was the best course of action. Everything seemed fine. I didn’t hear a thing from my ILs. Husband didn’t either. 


But. That dreaded word. Yesterday, with me at 39 weeks pregnant, my husband let me know he wants his parents to meet the baby at the hospital once she is born. He tried to claim we had agreed to this before. We did not. Before I agreed to NC, I told him explicitly that I did not want his parents at the hospital before, during, or after birth. If they wanted to meet her, it was going to be once we were home and I wasn’t feeling so vulnerable. 


The past week has been pretty awful. I’ve had false labor start and stop constantly. My body is sore and tired constantly. The unknown and unpredictability of labor if it’s truly starting is making my OCD unbearable. The last thing I needed was this thrown on me. So I had a really good hormonal breakdown. Once I cried it out, I tried to talk to my husband. And now I don’t know which way is up or down. 


I expressed to him that I’m comfortable with them meeting the baby on our terms with boundaries. Boundaries are a big thing that I worked on in therapy. My boundaries were that his mom apologizes for the way she’s treated me and talked to me, that they respect us as parents (individually and as a unit), that they understand being a grandparent is a privilege not a right, and that they don’t post any pictures of the baby on social media. I feel like those are fair. I have a reason for all of them based on past actions by his parents, especially his mom. But my husband let me know that he thinks it’s ridiculous to have boundaries like this. We’re making a prison around our baby and acting like correctional officers instead of parents. 


His big issue is that I want his mom to apologize to me. He says she will never think she was wrong in the situation and won’t apologize. She said some extremely hurtful things to me and to my husband about me. She told him that I do not matter to her at all and all she cares about is him and getting access to the baby. She lied about things and had a difficult time when I confronted her with screenshots of her lies. She even had the nerve to tell my husband that if I apologized to her, all would be forgiven. I know that an apology from her wouldn’t be sincere. But it’s something that I need to hear and I need her to understand that even if she doesn’t recognize what she did wrong, we do and we won’t accept it. 


When I told my husband that, his solution was to say that we’ll just go back to her never meeting the baby. I am so tired of this back and forth. He doesn’t want to confront her about what happened and it’s starting to frustrate me. It feels like to me he’s painting me as the bad guy to his parents and enabling the shitty things they say about me, because he’s afraid to confront this issue. It feels like he’s allowing me to hurt from all this to spare her feelings. And I don’t know how I feel about playing second fiddle to her. It doesn’t feel right. 


Are my boundaries asking too much? Should I let go of needing an apology from her? Is it okay for her to think she did nothing wrong and get access to the baby like nothing happened? Is my husband right on this and late stage hormones are making me the JustNo? Please help. I’m at my wits end with the stress of labor looming over my head. This is the last thing I want to deal with right now."
133,"See previous post for details. My husband got to come home yesterday and is doing great. I told him I wanted to send her home ASAP. I just couldn’t stomach spending a week with her in my house playing nice after this stunt. We didn’t really have a plan for how he would tell her, but he said he would handle it. After lunch i thought he went to lay down and rest and I was planning to do the same. I was in the bathroom indisposed if you will, when a text comes through from DH “she’s going home tomorrow”. Ok, wow.  A few seconds later MIL texts us both “I can go tonight if there’s a flight”. Apparently a lot went down while I was on the 🚽😂. So now I’m hiding in my room wondering why we are all texting each other!!  DH comes in and says he told her she has to listen to us and trust that when he asks her to do things in a certain way that there is a reason for it. He told her what she did was wrong and because of that it’s not a good time for her to be here and that we need her to go home. He said some more things to her about not sharing info about our health and that she had taken the most stressful moment of our marriage and made it harder on me. I asked him to have her come talk to me so I could tell her let’s drop this for now and just get through the day peacefully and let DH rest.  She comes in sorry, sorry, sorry. I said “I do not want to talk about this at all right now. I’m too angry. Let’s just leave it alone and we can talk about it after you’re home”. She says okay and then proceeds to talk at me about it😂.  I repeated let’s just stop now and she very testily says “so do you still want me to make dinner or not??”  Proving to me that she knows I don’t like her barging in my kitchen and cooking, but she does it anyway. It was a tense afternoon to say the least. 

Y’all that was major. We’ve never taken a stand like that before and it was hard. I’m very good at blaming myself for everything though. I’m feeling guilty for putting my husband through this while he’s recovering. I feel guilty for being a doormat and saying yes to so many things with her when I mean no. I am in therapy and this will definitely be something I ask for help with right away. If you were someone who let a lot slide and finally reached your breaking point, how did you deal with taking responsibility for your part in the dynamic?"
134,"Sooryy for this long text now, I am so bad in cutting this short. Whoever reads this till the end: I love you. You’re great.

my boyfriend and I live together (abroad) for a while now. His dad passed away when he was young - so he grew up with his mom (and brother). They are very close (talk once or twice a week on the phone). She always tells him how happy she is he found me and sometimes sends presents where she includes me as well. Very lovely and sweet - But here comes the issue:

She’s quite the dominant type of person. Always would use phrases that don’t allow any opinion that differs from hers e.g. ​“Of course I like that. Only an idiot wouldn’t like it.”​ (she talks like this to everyone). They say it’s her kind of humor whilst I feel it’s quite intimidating. Now she came over with her new man for a few days to visit us. First time I experienced her
a few days in a row. And.... I am seriously confused. Here a few examples why:

1. Shortly after arriving, she started watering the plants in our apartment. (whyyy?) When asked she said, ​“I’m doing what you should do.”​ - We told her to stop. We have a regular day for this. All plants are doing fine -​ really​ lol - But she replied: ​ “Don’t act all up. They won’t die from this.​” and continued.

2. Once she offered him a bit of her chicken curry. He declined. She went “just because your girlfriend is vegan it doesn’t mean you have to be too.” (He isn’t vegetarian or anything) he said “I’m not hungry that’s all.”- she gave me a weird look. 

3. Once she wanted to send him up a garage/carport thing in front of a restaurant to take a pic with ​“a better view”​. 
I said ​“I’m not sure it’s allowed to climb around here - but what about that bench over there?”​ and she went “​Jesus. he’ll be fine. calm down, woman.​”.
My boyfriend said “hey mum?! Don’t talk like that.” 
And she went “what?? Can’t she take a little joke?”  (What a funny joke)

4. She asked me “When you two will finally have a baby, is it allowed to sleep in the bed?”  
(We’re dating since two years)- I said ​“Uhm... I guess?​” She said “​ Good! I think people who don’t let their baby sleep in their bed are ridicilous”

There were many little examples but let’s leave it with those above.
It was allll..TOO much and invasive.  I felt I couldn’t even be myself around her. All was like a dominance battle. Not only about which woman her son should listen to (Plot twist: none of them.) - but also as if I was a little girl and should listen too.

My bf and I already talked about it - he agreed it felt super often inappropriate and reassured me he won’t accept behaviour like this.

BUT we’ll spend Christmas with his family (few days in a row) and... I am super nervous now to be honest.

Did any of you guys ever have similar situations? Am I too sensitive here? (Give it to me straight)
Do you have any advice here? (Also for the Christmas days PLS)

It’s his mum, and they love each other a lot - I don’t want to interfere in this or make him feel weird about her. I guess their bond is very strong because of the loss of his father. I understand that. It’s not that I don’t like her - I just don’t know how to act.

Thank you thank you thank you for any advice."
135,"Long Post Warning!

tl;dr FGMIL has become JustNo with racist remarks &amp; bragging about money. She blabbed about future engagement/marriage plans to FMIL (who is also JustNo) I’m ticked off &amp; want to address it with FGMIL. 

So my (28F) boyfriend (25M) and I have been together for 2 years, living with each other as well. 

I met his family less than 2 months into dating and on Thanksgiving nonetheless. His grandmother (FGMIL) was absolutely JustYes back then. FGMIL &amp; SO are pretty close (not bffs but he lived with her for 3-4 years after he turned 18). I felt I developed a good relationship with his grandma over the last 1.5 years until recently I started noticing a few things:

-FGMIL will make off-hand comments about people of color or freakishly off-color remarks (ex. She made a statement that Egyptians wear loincloths and dance around and ride camels all the time. I attempted to tell her the facts as I lived in the Middle East at one point and she brushed it off like it wasn’t wrong to make a poor statement like that). 

-We also live in a city where there a lot of refugees from Asia &amp; parts of Africa and also Mexican immigrants she’s made comments about how none of them speak English, none of them jobs or insurance (“because they’re lazy) but she’s PISSED that they get free healthcare &amp; get away with crimes. 

-I am half-white/half-Asian, she’s asked me over 20 times where my mom was born and where my mom’s parents (my grandparents) were born. My mom &amp; her parents are naturalized citizens thanks to joining the US Navy. She just doesn’t get how they can be naturalized without having come to the US first. 

Sidenote: I worry about her meeting my extended family because they are mostly Asian and of tan/darker skin tones than SO’s family. 

-She has made comments about my background (college, my upbringing, my family, etc.) and comparing it to her son’s (FFIL) and her grandson’s (my SO) were so much different than mine. She’s used an air of “it was better than yours” often when doing comparisons. 

-She is CONSTANTLY telling me how ABC cost her or how much they spent on XYZ (shopping, vacations, paying off a loan, etc.). Nearly every other story she brings up the cost of something or how much something is costing them now. Am I supposed to be impressed by this? 
If I’ve brought up my student loans, she boasts about how she paid for all of her kids (2 children) college years and loaned them money so they were debt-free. Must be nice, FGMIL. 

Most recently:

My SO &amp; I have talked about getting engaged next year (exciting!) and a month ago, I got a chance to stop by a wedding shop while killing time and I tried on a few dresses and took photos for my best friends &amp; my own mom (my family lives on the West Coast). 

2 weeks ago, I was dropping off a piece of luggage we borrowed from a recent trip at FGMIL’s house and I was showing FGMIL some photos and I had swiped one over to one of the wedding dresses. I told her that I had tried one on for funsies and that’s it. I didn’t tell her anything we were planning an engagement/marriage. 

We carried on a different convo and then FGMIL asked about our trip we took earlier to my best friend’s wedding- I told her how fun it was and how great it was to meet so many new friends &amp; family members of the bride and groom. I guess I made a comment about how big the wedding was because she then asked how big my extended family was (mostly Asian-Catholic family so it’s rather big) and how it would be interesting to see both our families in the same room.

She boasted a bit about her own wedding and her kids’ weddings and I said SO &amp; mine’s would likely be smaller as we don’t want the added stress of inviting too many or pay for a huge wedding. I didn’t think much of it. 

So tonight, SO was on the phone with his own mother (FMIL) who is usually JustNo (another story for another time). I could hear her through the phone and  she told SO how FGMIL told her about me trying on wedding dresses &amp; that I’m in “full wedding planning mode.” Y’all, I was pretty pissed. SO brushed it off easily though (very much a shiny spine man) and grey rocked it but FMIL wouldn’t drop it for about 5-10 min before the subject changed. 
When SO got off the phone, I told him that I’m not going to the weekly family dinners at FGMIL’s house for a bit now. I sat for a bit &amp; decided I want to address this with FGMIL as it was none of her business nor her place to tell FFMIL (the LAST PERSON we wanted to tell/find out about our future plans) and I don’t feel comfortable telling her about anything in the future. I mostly want to tell her that she’s wrong for blabbing &amp; causing a potential rift between SO’s family and myself. 

Am I wrong to be this upset about FGMIL blabbing? Is there a good way to address this with FGMIL without her making herself out to be the victim? 
I want to tell her that she crossed a line and lost my trust a bit as I felt she &amp; I had a good understanding of each other (I don’t tell anyone the shit she tells me about other people in her family). 

This lady has a tendency to be the victim ALL THE TIME and gets upset over the smallest shit (a power outage happened not too long ago &amp; she just about had a breakdown, the outage lasted less than 2 hours)."
136,"**UPDATE:  DH called SIL before I did, and she says that it’s probably best that I don’t go.  Which stings.  I feel like I’m just not a part of this family and I never have been to them.  I also called her and left a neutral message a few hours ago, seeing if I could take her for a day out, and haven’t heard anything.  Penny and her are regrettably close, and I know for a fact she’s been in her ear about me for months.  Wait til she has that baby though.  That’s all I gotta say about that.**

DH recently drew a line in the sand with Pennywise, stating she needed to apologize for the boundary-stomping, passive aggressive, disrespectful behavior towards me.

It’s been five days and crickets.

So, Pennywise calls DH while we are relaxing at home.  I say, “who is it?” to which he replies, “mom”, and then, quickly, “oh, oh okay.  I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”

So naturally I call out how sketchy that was and as a response he calls her and shoves the phone in my hands.

Thanks, DH.

First, she pretends she doesn’t know that I’m going to SIL’s baby shower, even though I accepted the invite at a dinner (I reminded her of this), and DH has been discussing arrangements with her over the phone regarding it.

She goes, “but you didn’t RSVPEEEEEEE.”  Like, okay.  She’s never been a stickler for that kind of stuff- I didn’t officially RSVP for SIL’s bridal shower, either.

And then she goes on to tell me and try to convince me that I really don’t want to go, so I shouldn’t go.

To which I remind her, Penny, it’s not about you.  I’m not going for you, I am going because I care about SIL.

Well.  That didn’t compute in that peanut brain.  She goes, “if you don’t like me then you can’t be at the shower.  I don’t want any bad vibes towards me.  I am throwing it for MY DAUGHTER.”

(I still don’t know what she meant by emphasizing “my daughter”.  Is she saying, “MY family, not YOUR family”???  Is that crazy that that’s what it sounds like to me?  She’s said that about DH before too, “Iiiii want to talk to MY SON.”)

Mind you, we haven’t even discussed anything about what I’m upset about or why.  She doesn’t care, frankly.  She just can’t have anyone around her that doesn’t positively embellish her little ego just the way she wants them to.  If ye shatter the facade given in the Book of Faces, just a kindly cat lady and an excellent grandmother, ye shall surely be banished.  Etc.

When I asked her why she hasn’t called yet to apologize, “ME apologize??  I Think YOUUUU need to apologize!”

Of course.  Narcissists 101, right?

I asked why.  She huffed for a moment, and then replied, “you were VERY rude to me last time I visited.”

(Mind you, this was after a visit complete with a barrage of gaslighting, smokeshows, and straight up lies about conversations we had had- or not had at all that she had just made up to paint me in a poor light to DH.  She’s recently also brought my kids to visit my NC abusive father without my knowledge or consent, turned away help I had hired to clean the house just to prove she could- yeah.  She’s a peach.)

I asked just to clarify, you’re disinviting me from SIL’s baby shower right?  Right.  “Well,” I told her, “I’m glad you’re exposing yourself for what you are.  That’s just the cherry on the narcissistic cake.”  Yeah, I started to lose it there, so I hung up the phone.

I’m furious.  Following the conversation, she texted DH chiding me for my “bad behavior”, like I’m her effing child or someone under her authority?  He replied that she has to apologize to me and that our Christmas plans to visit are effectively cancelled.

Support, please.  This has been an exhausting battle.  I can’t understand how people can expect relationships - like, really feel entitled to claim that relationship - without mutual respect.  Me not being able to state what upsets me and have it be addressed- that is 100% a toxic relationship.  I know that now.  If you don’t care enough about a person to address their concerns, that isn’t love.  That’s manipulation.  I’m just so angry that I can’t see straight, and I need to first know I’m not alone, and second if there is a possible way to NOT be consumed by this black hole of total toxicity?  Ugh.  What is wrong with these women?????"
137,"It has been a long time since I posted. Not because everything has been perfect but nothing really worth making a post has so... progress? Unfortunately, I’m pretty sure that’s about to change.

I feel bad for mil don’t get me wrong. Divorce is hard and I hate that she’s in the middle of one with her second husband. I guess I should explain that dynamic real quick before I explain why I’m probably going to need to vent more often eventually. And of course DH is super optimistic just like he was when he said she would never cash my check. (She did and I never received the last of it but whatever)

Mil finds something to complain about everything. At first her husband just dealt with her constant nagging and victim attitude. He loved her. They have had several times where divorce was imminent and her asking if we would take her in. It never happened. So, when hubby told me that it was happening I laughed and said it won’t happen. It did and her story definitely makes her soon to be ex a bad guy. He told her they were working it out just to bring her to a lawyer to sign the papers that she didn’t know he had drawn up for divorce. If he really did that, he’s awful and anyone deserves better. 

Now for the super fun part, the house next door is for sale. We live about 20 minutes from town and she is a caretaker in town. There are soo many houses in town for sale and some cheaper than the house next door and many in much better shape. Nope. She’s got to move next to her baby boy (who btw works on the road now!). She is going to be my next door neighbor once closing is done. 

Hubby has been on the road since March and there’s no end in sight either. Luckily all of this happened after I finally admitted I needed help with my depression and anxiety. Getting help has made all of this so much easier. 

She flagged me over while she was getting the inspection on the house and we were looking through for issues. (I’m always going to be nice to her unless she gives me a reason not to. She also hasn’t cornered me and been directly antagonistic since I yelled at her so I’m semi hopeful). Everything she saw in the house was (dh) can help with this and that. He’s on the road and our home is in dire need of repairs. I don’t know how she expects to get a fixer upper and have his help at this time. I’m lucky to see him every other weekend. 

Sorry for the long post. I know I’m probably stressing for nothing. 

TLDR: mil moving next door. Hubby working on the road and never home. She somehow thinks he’s going to help her fix up her house while his own house needs repairs."
138,"As mentioned in a previous post my MIL was creepily into her son's  personal, personal lives. She seemed to take a Great interest in making sure they were getting the good lovin...

Now this is mine and my SIL account of these conversations.... 
Cast is me, MIL and SIL

MY STORY
this conversation took place before the underwear incident so I guess partner and I had been together for less than a year. 

I was in the kitchen at MIL house; the kitchen is where everyone hung out ... Partner had finished a cigarette and left to get changed so we could go on a date. This is where MIL sees her chance
MIL- Me you need to know; if you're going to keep a man. You need to know how to please him.
Me: Well MIL before partner I was with my ex for 5 years so I think I do ok..... Lol
I look at her and her face is completely deadpan... I remember thinking... This can't be a serious conversation... But she continues
MIL - Partner is a very passionate man; so you want to keep him on his toes. Keep him surprised

Trying to keep my face from rolling up in disgust I stay quiet and she continues...
MIL- You've got to make sure you can keep up with him... And if you ever run out of ideas I HAVE BOOK YOU CAN BORROW
Im dead.... Omg... A book... Before I can respond partner walks in... MIL winks! at him... And partner pulls a face to say Err what and we leave... Partner asks me what that was about and I tell him he's like omg!!! What why...

Also I need to make you aware dear Reddit readers our ages.... We're not teenagers when me and partner started dating I was 25 and he was 31 ...

SIL STORY
So after this weird encounter partner takes me to meet brother and SIL they live a few hours away so we went to stay for the weekend. Now SIL and MIL had a very different sort of relationship MIL was under the assumption SIL had an motive for dating her son as in MIL's eyes brother was punching seriously above his weight.... And why would someone like SIL date brother.... Anyway we get on the subject of MIL and SIL  asks me how it's going. SIL then reels off her numerous encounters with her... Which spurs me to tell her about the story mentioned above and this is what she tells me....
After MIL realised SIL was going to be around for a while they'd been dating for a few years by this point... MIL said to SIL... 
You don't want to scare brother... You want to have a routine... Let him know what's coming... Maybe spice things up on special occasions; he's a shy boy so if SHE was SIL; She'd let brother know they were going to try something different. 


Arrrghhhh!!! 
Again I need to mention ages brother is 6 years older than partner and sister is 3 years older than me.... We're not children


So yeah another encounter... That's not the end of it either... They are more stories to be had

Thanks Reddit

Edit- I just wanted to add. My partner has not been a victim of abuse... If he had I wouldn't be sharing my stories on here out of respect.... When I relaid my encounters with MIL to him he was as weirded as I was..."
139,"So mil is the grandma. See old posts of past bullshit with her. I talked to my grandma last week, (my three year old's great grandma, whom he hasn't met), so when I got off the phone he wanted to talk to his grandma. We called, no answer, left a message. This was after I sent two texts the week previous. Of course I got nothing back. She called and talked to my husband and said she got our son a Halloween costume, that we didn't ask for, for him for Halloween, and said he could also use it as pajamas, which means he won't be getting it on time from her. She won't drive it to our house,or mail it, but she told him about it. Let me tell you that she has ample time to do anything she wants and money to do so. She doesn't work. She does a lot of online shopping and knows how to ship things. Anyway, this behavior led my husband and I have to an argument in front of our son. It came out that my husband says it's obvious that his parents don't really care about him and his family. How sad is that? Apparently he says it doesn't bother him. He says his family is us, and that's where he puts his focus. I feel like it must hurt deep down for him. We moved an hour away because mil acted the same way when we lived super close to her. We are stuck going to her house for Thanksgiving, and inevitably for me, there will be hurt feelings, since I feel she treats us like shit but any time I tell her so she freaks out. My husband doesn't want to say anything, because he says it will make it worse with her behavior, and she's not going to change. I don't know what else to say. We were planning on having a Halloween party for our son so I texted her about that since my son wants her to come and she told him she wants to go. Don't know if I will hear back. I guess the worst part is that she seems to always be doing stuff with her husband's son and his wife and their daughter. It feels thrown in our face. Like they went to the beach, and she told us she was going with them, and didn't invite us. Sucks to be treated like shit and I guess I'm not looking forward to pretending everything is okay for the rest of my life. It bothers me so much because my family is so dysfunctional. My mom is homelessness and rumored to be on meth and I have no way of contacting her and any time she does call me, the last time being early June, she tries to use me. Same with my dad. I haven't talked to him in about seven years. The last time I saw him he was homeless and reeked of urine and later I found out he was homeless on purpose because he was wanted for downloading child porn. So l don't really feel like I have family. I had a horrible childhood and never felt like I had a family and don't want that for my son, or my daughter. My daughter is one, but I feel like they will both figure it out sometime about the mil grandma and it will be sad for them, to which my husband agrees,  and I'm not able to tell her how it affects our family because it will just make her behavior worse. 
Edit- she finally got back to me and denied ever getting the message my son left on her answering machine. Flat out lie. I cannot fathom how a person could not get a message on an answering machine. Also, she's the only person that would check the machine.threres no one that would have erased a message"
140,"For those just joining us, my younger sister, (referred to as Sis) was put on the 5-2 diet by JNMum, which had her eating 5 days a week and fasting for 2, and kept a padlock on her door and another on the fridge and I've been granted guardianship as dad is still overseas. JNMum is still in police custody, awaiting a court date. JNSis (our older sister and mum's flying monkey) has had a restraining order filed against her. Taking a while to be finalised but looking good.

&amp;#x200B;

We've moved into a bigger place, one where Sis has an actual bedroom rather than a section of the living room, and she's really made it her own (picked her own paint, posters, and picked her own furniture) and she's got back into exercising, and baking. She's asked to help with cooking, and now she cooks with us or on her own one or two nights a week. Sis ended up dropping out of the college she was in, but she transferred to a different college nearby for a fresh start, which has done her a lot of good. Sis is now nearly (not all the way but close) to a healthy weight, with only one brief set back early on (a day or two after my last post).

We found a private female therapist who took her case and she's been going twice a week for the last month, which we're dialing back to once a week (therapist's suggestion). For those concerned about the possibility of sexual abuse with her not wanting a male therapist, we asked her about it and it's just that she felt a guy couldn't understand it. I was open with her about my own struggles with food but she still doubted a male therapist could discuss stuff like that the way a female therapist could, as Mum had always presented it to her as a ""woman's issue"". DW has taken her on a few ""girls day outs"". They did some activity, like cinema or something, and then walked back through the high street, and if Sis wanted to take a look in a shop they did, and DW helped her buy some clothing. Thanks to everyone who said to not make clothing the focus because now they just go on girls' days and we all treat it like if she sees some clothes she wants, cool, if not, it's not like the day was wasted because they still did something.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiancee has become Darling Wife. It wasn't related to this, it was a career thing for me. We wanted to take a few days off when we got married and I wound up undergoing a change of jobs recently and suddenly. My start date for my new job is the 1st November, and my previous job ended on the 30th September, and she was able to take a few days, so we signed a marriage certificate and made it all official on the 19th October. We're going to have a proper honeymoon over winter, when JYDad will be off work, so him, me, DW and Sis might all go somewhere, but on Friday Sis had a residential trip with college (which she did fine with), so she was there when we signed the certificate, then she went to college for her residential, and DW and I got a room at one of the nicer hotels in town.

&amp;#x200B;

JNMil (DW's mum) has not been in contact since the incident where she commented on my sister's weight, and is under strict rules not to come back. Fiancee blocked her on social media, and we've been no contact for nearly 2 months. She either saw, or heard through someone else, that we'd gotten married, and made a post basically saying it's a shotgun wedding. It's not. We want kids some day but so much has gone on lately it's really messed with our timeline. She's heard about the moved up wedding and assumed that means my wife is expecting.

My wife wants to reply but that would involve unblocking her, and she's gotten over 30 messages in less than an hour, so if anyone has any suggestions for how to reply we welcome them."
141,"Okay this is weird and I'm sorry in advance. My mom is a conspiracy theorist and is absolutely convinced there's a secret part of the government or another spooky entity that is hoarding all data from from any kind of genetic test.

 Well we are pregnant and at risk due to maternal age. Our doctors strongly suggesting getting the NIPT testing, but when mom found out she lost her Collective shit and is causing major issues. She's convinced that ""THEY"" are collecting genetic data on everyone and even though the company that we want to do it through is regulated through HIPAA she's convinced that they have a seedy underbelly that will test the blood of both mom and baby and get some crazy information from it and bad shit will happen.

I understand that this is some crazy here but she has stronger hold on the situation then I like. So here we are at 12 weeks and are at a standstill because she's raising holy hell over this and I am at a fucking loss at what to do.

I need help a few different fronts one how to confront her and talk her down from the crazy.
I've done some research on the testing and I found that they only test the cfdna, Can they pull any information about Mom from that or is it literally just testing for genetic markers for the disorders that they test for?
 
I cannot get a clear answer as to what bad shit will come from a simple blood test but she is convinced that there is something bad will happen.

I am going insane trying to figure out a solution for the situation.
 
One final thing I know that we could just go get the testing done, I know that this will alienate her and cause unknown quantity of family strife. I'm on your other crazy shit so if I can ask very kindly please don't tell me to just go get the testing done I need some form of padding to get through this."
142,"  Hi everybody, tonight we have the talk (see last post) with eFIL, who will most likely turn out to be a biiiiig flying monkey and it is stressing us out. My SO wanted to call it off, changed his mind again, and ended with “well, if FIL wants to dig his own grave, it’s up to him, nobody can try to still put the blame on us anymore then”.

Anyhow, this is a short request really: which recording app would you recommend? I have a recording app of iPhone on my phone, but never tried it so not sure about quality and so. 

Any tips on this? How to make sure it keeps recording, even if the phone goes to standby from not touching the screen? Or does it do that automatically? Maybe stupid questions, but I always was an Android-user, until my job gave me an iPhone a few months ago.

Don’t worry, this recording is not to be used in a court or something like that, it is for myself and for my SO as a reminder, and to be fair, to be able to let my parents hear what it’s like. Also, it is eitherway legal for us in our country to record people without their knowledge (asked this to the Family lawyer I went to talk to after the GPR-threat of Hallmark Horseshit)

No gaslighting for us, sir, no. 

Thank you.

Ps: when I can this week, I’ll upload the last text convos (beginning of last week) between SO and Hallmark Horseshit – as already said, it’s in a different language so I’m translating them instead of uploading the screenshots. Will then also update how the talk went. I’m ready and “armed” with the correct grey rocking responses and have made a bullet point list mentally of all the things she has done/said/… Not to try to tell and convince FIL that she really is at fault and has offended us, insulted us, threatened us, and so much more (because let’s face it, he is eFIL for a reason) but for me, to keep in my mind that we really are right for sticking to our boundaries and wanting VVVVVVVVLC to NC with her.


————————————

!!!!! EDIT 1 !!!! 

eFIL just cancelled because he “has a cold”. He asked/told my SO via text that FIL would be coming Sunday morning. I am angry. No consideration of our time, of our life again. And SO being a duh already said Ok. All the stress of today will now continue until Sunday.

143,"All old stories as I make sure to now watch TV away from her and her commentary

First story: The music video for Taylor Swift’s “White Horse” came on VH1. And I believe there’s one point in the video where she’s crying over a guy. JNmom sees this and scoffs “why is she crying over a guy, she has her moooommmmyyyyy and daaaaaaadddddyyyyyyyy!”

Again, this is exactly why I have not told her jack shit about my SO. She will compete with him and put him down about his career, appearance, whatever she can. Also because interracial relationship.

Now, we move onto when I was maybe 17-18 and had started watching the show “My Boys”. I liked it and it was entertaining to me. But cue in my mom judging PJ (the main character). “So who are all these guys in relation to heeeeerrrr? That one’s her broooothheeeeeeerrrrrrr, that one her booooyyyyyyfriiiiieeeeeeennnndddd! What about the others?!” 

Following which I forget if I told her this to shut her up about the show or if she drew that conclusion on her own. But somehow she settles with the answer that those guys are all PJ’s brother’s friends. And she starts criticizing a FICTIONAL CHARACTER for hanging out with her brother’s friends and that only slutty girls hang out with a bunch of guys. 

Again, I forget the whole premise of the show as it’s been YEARS since I’ve watched it. But she *did* have a female friend that she hung out with who had a starring role and wasn’t recurring, iirc. Either way, enjoy this funny story of JNmom judging characters portrayed on TV."
144,"Old story, delivered as promised.

TL/DR: Very long, lots of background. Details of a 5 day vacation with Pig Farmer which ends in the infamous truck-pooping incident.

Sorry this post took a little more than 24 hours. We were out hunting buffalo yesterday. I'd absolutely share a pic as proof, but I can't seem to remember my imgur login and I'm too lazy to create a new one. Note, no buffalo were harmed but we totally did find them and get some cool pics. Now onto our very long story...

As mentioned in previous posts, Pig Farmer was more-or-less behaved prior to FIL's totally unexpected death. Don't get me wrong, their relationship was volatile - hence the calls from county lockup and whomping one another with the Cuisinart on a semi-regular basis, but they kept that shit mostly in-house where we didn't have to deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note: who the hell throws $500 a set cookware at their spouse on a regular basis? Seriously, if you're gonna make a habit out of throwing the soup pots and frying pans, go to Walmart and get you some Mainstays basics. Chunking cookware that's more expensive than your kid's first car is just adding insult to injury.

&amp;#x200B;

Now where was I... oh yeah, the vacation from hell. SFIL died abruptly. Pig Farmer actually came out ahead on that one. She got his life insurance plus his military retirement for life. It was substantially more than she would have gotten had they divorced like everyone thought they needed to.

&amp;#x200B;

With 6 figures in the bank and no one to play with, PF makes DH and I an offer. We had been tentatively planning a move to TN for the following year. She offers to pay for us to move PLUS give DH his college fund, which she is suddenly insisting she never spent and has been safe in a special savings account waiting for him this whole time. SFIL dying and her suddenly actually having the money on hand has absolutely no connection at all.We did not believe the part about her never spending the money, but we opted to overlook it (yes, this was also a mistake, probably) in favor of actually getting the money. We hadn't been doing all that well financially and the money was a huge help at that point in our lives. PF also gives DH SFIL's car at this point, with the promise that we'll get the title once we move.

&amp;#x200B;

We agree to all of it. The move. The money. The car. The taking Pig Farmer to TN with us. Hell, the move made sense. We wanted to go, cost of living was lower and the step-kids lived in TN, so PF could continue her relationship with them.Pig Farmer then proposes we go on a vacation to TN so that we can see and experience the area + iron out details of the move, find a rental, etc etc. She suggests we all live together initially with the promise she will be buying a home outright with the proceeds of SFIL'S life insurance, firmly securing her retirement. The plan is that we will keep the rental house after she moves out. It all sounds fine and dandy, so the trip is scheduled. She also gives DH half of his college fund, with the promise of the other half after we move.DH promptly spends the money on a used but very clean Dodge Ram 1500 truck. At the time it was the nicest vehicle he'd ever owned. Being morons, we then proceed to take on what will forever be known as the hellcation.

&amp;#x200B;

Hellcation day 1: 

Actually, probably the best day of the hellcation. A pleasant drive through Georgia and Alabama up into TN. DH and I are sitting up front. Pig Farmer is in the back with kids 1 &amp; 2. At the time, they were like 5 and 2. We stopped at some tourist stops. We went by the college I graduated from and took the kiddos around campus. We saw sights. Ate cracker barrel. It was pleasant. Cheerful, even.

&amp;#x200B;

Hellcation day 2: 

&amp;#x200B;

We start off after having breakfast a cracker barrel by driving around and checking out areas to potentially live in. Its mildly interesting for adults, boring for captive small people. We kinda just spend the whole day wandering about the place. Eat at damned cracker barrel again for lunch. Its pleasant, but kiddos get bored. We go back to the hotel and the very first fight of the trip occurs. Note, this will be the first of many. 

&amp;#x200B;

The kids want to play in the pool. Pig Farmer does not. The kids have been good but cooped up in the truck for 2 days now. I overrule PF and take the kids to the pool. PF has a minor meltdown. I don't really remember the exact details, but it was stupid and DH and I were annoyed. It was supposed to be a vacation. We booked a place with a pool specifically for cheap kid entertainment. While we we swimming, PF finds a house and schedules for us to go look at it. Immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Swimming is interrupted to go look at this place. It's an enormous older trailer being sold, owner financed, for a premium. It has several broken windows. Smells like cigarettes. Carpets are gross. The property is around an acre, too big for PF to maintain, to small for me to keep the horses at. PF decides to impulse buy it and prepares to write the guy a 10K personal check for the downpayment- and then lets it slip that we can just keep the place if she decides she doesn't like it. Oh, hold up, hell no. I don't impulse buy owner financed property at a high ass interest rate and full market value. Fuck that. I don't even like the place NOW. Sketchy dude selling the place offers us a different place. PF doesn't want to go look at it. I fucking insist. Second place is same $, more land, but still a complete dump. Bonus second dump house on property so we can all live there together but under different roofs. I don't love it, but I like it slightly more than the first one. PF, however, hates it. DH is staying out of it, but when pressed admits he doesn't like either one. We can't agree, so we leave without buy-here-pay-here-ing a house (amen).

&amp;#x200B;

That night for dinner PF decides to take us all to an extremely fancy restaurant, including the 2 and 5 year olds. They weren't terrible, but they were little kids. For little kids, they were good. Compared to civilized adults, they were messy,  picky and whiny. Pig Farmer was apparently shocked by this and gets very upset midway through dinner that she feels underappreciated and neglected and all she wanted was a really nice meal and bringing a 2 year old was not conducive to that. Also, I'm a bitch for throwing a fit and not letting her impulse buy a house. I undermined her. I made her feel bad. I wasn't particularly sorry, because holy fuck I'd rather be mean than 10K into a house I hate with 100+K still owed. I apologize, sort of, but mainly just feel awkward. PF winds up apologizing after dinner, but we go to bed tense.

&amp;#x200B;

Hellcation day 3:

&amp;#x200B;

 Impulse buying real estate is blessedly off the table after yesterday's arguments, but after yet another meal at cracker barrel, PF and I manage to butt heads very quickly over rentals.

&amp;#x200B;

PF wanted to rent like a queen, but I was very aware that DH and I only had a beer budget. We are WAY far apart in what we consider an acceptable monthly rent. This was an issue bc PF'S ""plan"" was to live with us briefly and then buy, whereupon she would move out and we'd be responsible for all the bills for the rental. Obviously, a rental whose rent was 3/4 DH'S monthly income wasn't a good idea for us. I was not interested in getting moved in, putting kids in school and then getting evicted for non-payment 6 months later. PF, however, declares anything reasonable an unlivable dump. Pig Farmer has been living average af, so this is fucking ridiculous. It's not like she's going from mansion on a golf course to trailer park. She's going from average house to average house. WW3 erupts. Entire move is called off, because I'm not moving if I can't afford the rent and she's mad at me. Lines are drawn. Kids are crying. We're done, screw this.  PF backs down. DH points out this shitshow was supposed to be a vacation and no one has yet to have any fun. We go to the zoo. Kids like zoo. PF spoils the piss out of them there. Things calm down. We eat at the zoo, overpriced but at least it's not cracker barrel... Later that day a rental is located and deemed acceptable despite being UNDER even my budget. Despite having some reservations, we go ahead with renting it. DH and I really wanted to move... We were excited about a fresh start away from his hometown full of JustNo's and we dont think living briefly with PF will be that bad. Rental goes in DH and PF'S names, jointly. PF pays 6 months rent ahead, to sooth landlord's concerns about no one being employed within 500 miles.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so, yay. That's done with. House is rented, so discussion of furniture and appliances naturally comes up next. Now, Pig Farmer's house in FL was infested with bed bugs. Most likely due to SFIL choosing hotels poorly while spending time with his mistress. We knew none of her furniture would be moving with us. I vote we bring a few essentials from our house and then take our time furnishing the new house.PF HATES this plan. It is absolutely unacceptable. We cannot possibly expect her to live without a full house load of furniture. Not even for a single fucking day! No way, Jose! Pig Farmer does not rough it for a week while finding and purchasing new furniture! Pig Farmer's ass ain't sitting in no camping chair for a day or two. Hell naw. She classy.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, she insists we must buy our furniture locally so the locals will know we have money. Seriously. That was her logic. Unfortunately, this is a small ass town with 2 furniture stores total. The salesperson in the first store opted to answer her phone and proceed to have a long conversation rather than sell furniture, so we wound up at the second place. A wholesale furniture, continually going out of business kind of deal. It's all particle board garbage, but PF is bound and fucking determined to shop local, so she refuses to allow us to go elsewhere. As she is paying, we are kinda stuck. Especially since she hasn't given us the second half of his money and he spent the first half on the dodge.Yall, she dropped 10K on cheap ass particle board furniture. 10K. DH and I were not allowed to choose anything, because this was her furniture and if I wanted to pick and choose my furniture, she'll pay for me to do that in 6 months when she moves out of the rental. Meanwhile, this is all her furniture and she'll buy what she wants, thank you very much. In short order, she has dropped an obscene amount of cash on this crapola and arranged its delivery. She then goes to the local scratch and dent appliance place and does the same, including an enormous deep freezer DH says is too big (we actually still have it, it's still too big...) and doesnt want because it wont fit inside the rental. I swear to god, she went through 15K in a single afternoon. It was jaw dropping for a penny pincher like myself. Absolutely jaw dropping.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this spectacle, we hit a small town festival and the kids have fun and then we hit cracker barrel for the 15th time this trip and then go back to the hotel. Kids swim. Everything is quiet. DH and I have forgotten our misgivings because we're excited now. We'd been planning and saving for this move for over a year and now it was a reality. We were stupidly happy. Sunshine and rainbows. Pig Farmer becomes surly and bitchy because she has spent so much money. We are non-plussed, because I literally tried to stop her. Multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

Hellcation day 4: 

&amp;#x200B;

We start off, guess where, cracker barrel, and then go to the rental to wait on furniture and appliances to be delivered. She paid extra to get it done fast. DH and I wait with kids for deliveries while she takes off and gets all the utilities put in her name. DH tried to protest that, since we'd be keeping the rental after she moved out - but yall know how that went. Furniture arrives, is set up and it is noted we forgot a few things (PF had no dresser, nowhere to put TV in living room, minor shit). I suggest waiting, but nah.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the furniture store we go. The sales folk are ECSTATIC to see PF. Unsurprisingly. She buys more crapola and then is hungry. Yes again. Kiddo #1 goes mutinous against Cracker Barrel, so we get Mexican. Kids hit the pool briefly. I dont remember how we spent the rest of the afternoon. I think at the tag office swapping over driver's licenses and the tag on the dodge, since nothing says vacation quite like the DMV with two small kids and your MIL! Still, all this needed to be done because we were headed home in the am. The plan is to go home and return in roughly a month once everything in FL is settled and, ahem, Pig Farmer is finally off probation. Kids spend the evening at the pool after we once again get drug to cracker barrel. There are other restaurants, sure, but why bother?

&amp;#x200B;

Hellcation day 5 aka **The Shitpocalypse**: 

&amp;#x200B;

It's time to pile back in the truck and go back to FL. DH valiantly attempts to get PF to eat the hotel's complimentary breakfast, but fuck that. Back to cracker barrel. We no longer need menus. Pig Farmer proceeds to drink a bucket load of coffee despite being well aware we are about to get in the truck for 10+ hours.There is a bit of a disagreement at breakfast. PF is wanting to treat the return trip like we treated the trip up, kind of a Sunday-drive meets casual tourism thing. DH says no, because he has to go to work the next day and kiddo #1 has school. He's pretty firm about it. Vacation is over, it's time to go home. Pig Farmer gets huffy and puffy, but we're honestly too self-absorbed with our own discussions of the move and upcoming plans to pay her puffing much attention. She was grumpy, whatever, she'd been alternating between Mrs. Claus McMoneybags and Grumpy Cat all trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Even looking back, I don't feel like we had any warning of what was to come. There was no huge fight. No screaming tantrum. Just us being happy, and PF being PF. Once breakfast was over, we piled back in the truck and headed south.We're cruising along and everything is going absolutely as fine as it can when you've got a sulky MIL and 2 small children in the backseat when Pig Farmer asks if anyone wants to stop and use the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I haven't addressed this issue yet in this post, but Pig Farmer thinks truck stops are Mickey Mouse Club Houses for serial killers. She gets very offended when you stop at truck stops. DH always stops at truck stops, because his Dad's side of the family has a bunch of truckers and he grew up riding along in the big rigs. Pig Farmer will not get out of your vehicle at a truck stop. She is too scared and will make you drive elsewhere unless you yell at her. DH started yelling at her on day 1 of this trip because he wasn't putting up with that shit and she isn't the delicate little flower she tries to pass for. It was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

At any rate, the next stop available for the bathroom is a truck stop and DH informs her of this. She does NOT want to stop there and tells him to keep going. She does not indicate we are on the verge of any kind of bathroom emergency. This will be important to remember later on.

&amp;#x200B;

So there were are, cruising down I-75 not 5 minutes later when Pig Farmer suddenly yells at DH to pull over. Now! Except, he can't because it's an interstate and there isn't any fucking exit available ""now"". We passed up the last exit because of the big, scary truck stop. There wont be another one for several more miles because we're in rural northern Georgia.That is NOT good enough. Pig Farmer begins literally yelling at DH that he has to pull over at a bathroom right now. Right now. As in right this very fucking second. The fact that there is neither an exit or a bathroom available is irrelevant. The fact that she passed up a bathroom less than 5 minutes ago is also irrelevant. She has to have a bathroom NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

This immediate pull off doesn't happen since there isn't a bathroom available and pulling over on the shoulder of a major US interstate for your mother to (we assumed) pee is definitely a no-go. Probably a ticket, knowing Georgia Highway Patrol.

&amp;#x200B;

Pig Farmer is getting more demanding with every passing second. Hysterical, even, which neither DH or I really know what to make of. PF is just screaming at him that he has to get off the interstateHe finally reaches an exit and proceeds to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Alas, it is too late... as we are coming down the exit ramp, an ominous noise is heard from the backseat, a foul odor accompanying it. PF abruptly shuts the fuck up as DH pulls into the first gas station beside the ramp. Its really too late tho. She doesn't even try to stop or jump out. Nope. She just sits there, in the backseat, making eye contact in the rearview as the coffee shits explode out of her and the 5 year old beside her starts to gag.

&amp;#x200B;

I will soon learn that PF has ""tummy troubles"" as a result of (unsuccessful) weight loss surgery years ago - the nice folks here on this sub have identified these troubles as ""dumping syndrome"". It has a name, and triggers, and foods you are definitely supposed to avoid, but which PF doesn't avoid. PF eats and drinks whatever PF wants in whatever quantities PF wants, which results in PF regularly having to sprint for the potty. This is not the first time Pig Farmer has had an accident. It will not be the last, either, regrettably. I has regerts.

&amp;#x200B;

Once PF is good and done ass-sploding all over the backseat, she shuffles/butt-drags her way out of the truck and drips along to the bathroom, from which she bathes in the sink and demands clean clothes from her luggage.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the 5 year is asking if Grandma is potty trained and DH is about to absolutely lose his ever-loving mind. At this point, he has owned this truck for less than a week and the backseat is now covered in diarrhea because his grown-ass mother cannot bring herself to use a truck stop bathroom or lay off the coffee. He is livid. We wind up hosing the thing down at a carwash nearby. It wasn't the kind of interior that's meant to be hosed down, so it wound up pretty soggy and gross. It also smelled incredibly foul. Really, incredibly foul. And we got to ride in it for 9 more hours with the windows down. It wasn't summer. We froze our asses off. Hands down the most disgusting ride of my life. I think DH spoke a total of 10 words the entire drive. I didn't say much more myself. No one did, except PF. Pig Farmer totally spent the next 9 hours alternating between sleeping and acting like nothing was wrong and we were overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I am not sure I have ever been more relieved to get out of car than I was that night. Should we have called off the move at this point? Probably, but there was a freshly rented house full of brand new furniture waiting back in TN, so we were pretty well committed. Pig Farmer knew it too, because her behavior only got worse from here.Next time, I'll post about the actual move.

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note in reference to this move, been posting some pics on the book of faces and one of my good friends commented that I look like a different person in the pics because I actually look happy. Its made me think a lot harder than it should, because I kinda agree with her. The few pics I've taken out here have been better than usual and I was trying to figure out if I've managed to lose 10 pounds somewhere, but no, it's just that I actually look happy."
145,"Looking for a little support here - I have a NMIL (well, almost - FDH and I are engaged), and she is driving me nuts. We moved in w/her and FDH’s father bc of significant health issues they were facing. We were going to move out after getting them set up w/in home health care. However, FDH’s father passed earlier this year and we are in between a rock and a hard place. NMIL has put a lot of pressure on us to stay with her, with the usual tactics- “I can’t survive without you,” “I can’t do things on my own anymore”, etc. she does have health issues which are managed with medication and she is elderly, but not immobile. I’m about at my wits end w/her. Anyone who has lived or even deals on a consistent basis with an NMIL knows how emotionally challenging this can be. I’m expected to constantly entertain her, talk to her as long as she pleases, answer every phone call, etc. the “emotional labor” is pretty extensive w/her. FDH and I are working on a move out plan but for the time being, I need to figure out how to deal with NMIL. I’ve started to set better boundaries - not answering the phone if I’m busy, not automatically talking to her the second I walk in the door, telling her I’m busy, etc. however, this doesn’t seem to register. If I don’t “greet” her the second I get in from work, she will come downstairs and start talking to me regardless. I will clearly be trying to get house stuff done and she’ll just sit down and start talking to me regardless of what I’m doing (I could be napping, taking a test, talking with FDH, and the outcome is the same - she’ll interrupt and expect me to drop everything I’m doing to entertain her). I could give countless examples of how aggravating she is, but I’ll refrain. Because I have started setting boundaries, she has taken to telling the neighbors we have “started to abandon her” and “she’ll just have to let us live our lives” and told me directly “she doesn’t know what she has to do to get us to give her more attention.” Our job is not to serve her constantly, meet her every need, and pay attention to her 24/7. I’m just over this constant expectation that I’m going to slave around for her 24/7, so I am stopping the constant “doting daughter in law” act. I hate feeling forced/expected to do things and hate having her project her feelings/needs on to me. No matter what I do, she has a critique for me and the way I do things. I feel like FDH and I have been nice enough to her, and we both recognize how difficult she is. Am I wrong to set these boundaries ? Am I mean for this? Do I need to be more compassionate given what she’s been through losing her husband/her health problems? I’m having a hard time differentiating what is our responsibility versus what we’re not responsible for. I’m not trying to be stingy with my time or love, but I feel like she has been forced on me in a lot of ways, and this kills my desire to be nice/patient/helpful. Love/support and compassion are greatly appreciated here."
146,"Recently engaged to my wonderful partner of five years. I’ve always gotten along well with his parents and actually have a pretty good relationship with his mother but I will admit that sometimes she makes me want to punch myself in the face.

She’s a sweet person but sometimes I get low-key manipulative vibes and we have radically different worldviews. She is traditional, religious, and does not seem to have the capacity for any kind of critical thinking. For example, she believes everything she reads on the Internet and gets hysterical about the way “the world is today.“ 

She seems to believe that before the 1970s that the world was a utopia and nobody had any other problems and that it is somehow the current generation’s fault when something goes wrong. I tried to speak reason to her but she has lived a very sheltered life and doesn’t believe it preferring to catastrophize based on everything she reads online or hears on the news.

She is very kind and generous and this is going to sound pretentious but sometimes her childish worldview makes me have to limit my time.

She prattles on about everything and is constantly worried about minutia. She knows that I am not religious but she’s always telling me that I need to pray and will sometimes send me scripture and “inspirational” quotes even though she knows I don’t like religion or contrived platitudes.

I always try to be really patient with her, make myself helpful, and not silence her because I know that my FFIL is low-key sexist and always telling her to shut up. And it seems to work. We get along and she always says how much she adores me.

Am I ungrateful for my sometimes annoying but perfectly sweet and decent mother-in-law? Based on what I what I read here, I know I could have it much worse but she sometimes drives me insane!"
147,"(sorry it's long and I'm typing on my phone so won't be formatted the best) My last post was about having to look after Jacob ( the dog) for the week, when before all of that we couldn't even take him down to ours for a little bit as it would upset him to much. Fast forward to my birthday she rings SO up crying that SOs sister had gotten a puppy and recently hadn't been able to deal with her because she was a problem pup and needed to have time away from her. So she brings the puppy down to ours for us to have for a couple weeks ( this is the first time she has ever been down to our house or even near it) and this is close to the time we should be having Jacob(dog) ( who isn't good with other dogs as he hadn't been socialized as a puppy) so we look after the puppy for a couple weeks ( no where near a problem dog, she's just a puppy she's still learning she is easily excited and jumps but again only 2-3 months old. When she brings the puppy down to us MIL completely ignores me and my friend who was there (since it was my birthday people where coming the whole day to see me) she proceeds to basically interrogate SO about our house and about what we have been doing and trys to search our house looking through everything and gets pissed off with me when I tell her she has no right to look through our things or go upstairs as there's nothing to do with her upstairs. Then gives SO his birth presents ( it's a couple days before mine) it's three big brands and saying how she bets I didn't get him anything nearly as expensive as she got him and that it clearly shows who then cares more for him. And that he's made a mistake coming with me. She then in the same breath starts to berate him on putting weight on and that the jeans she bought him might not fit since he's ""got so fat and looks disgusting now and he's clearly not taking care of himself"" ( he has only gone up maybe one size)  

Within the first week of having her we taught her not to jump up at people and then we find out she wasn't getting any attention or training at home which is half the reason she's so ""badly behaved"" At this point MIL is trying to convince SOs sister to get rid of the puppy or give her to us (without talking to us about this first!)  because she can't take care of it or afford it ( oh and she had came to us with no bowls, no bed of any kind, a collar from an old dog, and one box of dog biscuits , not having had any injections or having been flead or wormed) she knows that if it was needed we would have in a heartbeat but not when it is her trying to shove it onto us and force SOs sister's hand to do this. Two weeks down. I spent money I received for my birthday getting food for her since we only got a small box of biscuits for her. SOs sister comes to pick her up from us and take her home we let her know that puppy has been an angel while with us and telling her what we have taught her so far. 

The day SOs sister picks the puppy up is the day before we should be taking Jacob for the week. MIL has told SO he can walk the hour and a half to pick Jacob up and then walk it back again to take him to ours because he could use it since he's put so much weight on. And then he can do the exact thing when it's time to take him back. Once Jacob(dog) gets here she says she'll come and drop off his food for us. So why couldn't she just drop Jacob (dog) off since she'll be coming down anyway.  

We get Jacob (dog) to ours later and SO tells me that she won't be dropping off any food for him because ""all he will eat is human food"" so in other words she hasn't been buying food for him and just giving him the scraps of food no one wants. So we have to shell out for her so that Jacob(dog) can eat while he's with us. We also realised how little he has been walked and how misbehaved he has become since no one will give him attention. While we are looking after him we had decided he would sleep in the kitchen ( which is bigger than the room he normally gets left in) and the first night he stays he starts howling and barking which we can understand it's a new place so we go we put his teddy in there with him ( he loves it and it seems to calm him down) and we tell him to lay in his bed and he goes and lays down. We go upstairs again and go to sleep ourselves, he keeps howling but we were told the best thing to do was to leave him until he stops howling. The morning isn't too bad he stopped howling after about 15 minutes when we went up and there was no signs of him being upset or trying to get out. The next night we leave him there again same thing and then the next night is the same but the howling is much worse. 

On the fifth or sixth night  he howls the entire night scratching and biting at the door and at the walls we go down in the early morning to see that he has scratched or bitten at the door handle bit that keeps it closed and bust it and has gotten into the living room and bitten at our sofa and ruined it to the point we will have to get a new one. And now the kitchen door won't close again (we also have lost the bond we put on the house now as well because of it) there's not anything we can do the next few nights but leave him in the living room during the next few nights but the howling doesn't calm down. I know he is doing this because SO normally will let him get away with whatever he wants but I refuse to let Jacob (dog) sleep upstairs it's not something he is normally allowed and I didn't want him upstairs with us while he was staying over. SO trys to tell me that Jacob hasn't done anything wrong at all since being with us at all and that I should let him do whatever he wants even if that's going upstairs to ruining more furniture. This has annoyed me so much since I have been saying constantly that we were to have him because it would be bad for all of us and I did not want him at ours at all. SO went behind my back to agree a date to bring him down before they went away anyways. He has also snapped at my sister twice while she has been over at ours.

 He has got so badly behaved since he was left with them. With no way of getting him as ours like he was meant to be I don't know what to do about it. We have tried again to find ways to get Jacob(dog). But MIL has told us there is no way we will have him and that we will only look after him when it benefits her. Therefore I told her that we will not being taking Jacob(dog) again as he has caused so much damage to our house and she has ignored that and tried to tell us our house is no different. ( She hasn't been in to see any of what I'm saying) and that I'm just making it up to shove another wedge between them. Am I in the wrong here?? After all this has gone off while I had said he wasn't to come round at all since it was just because it worked in favour of MIL and all the rest of the time she said he couldn't come as it would make him scared upset sad and nervous. And with having a puppy here before just put it into perspective just how badly behaved he has gotten."
148,"Apparently I never reblocked EW after snooping on her profile a while back (I know I know) and she sent me messages the other day. (3am I might add)

First one was made to look like an apology, the second one ACTUALLY CONTAINED AN APOLOGY.

Long story short we’re meeting up with her on Saturday at a local café, me, DD and DH. No I am not looking forward to it.

She needs to know how much she’s hurt me, I’m not gonna let her get away with rugsweeping, so I need advice on what to say to her? I will leave immediately if she tries anything funny or brings her creepy boyfriend with her.

I will be babywearing so her interactions with DD will be severely limited

Thanks in advance"
149,"so friends last I left you, we messaged  MitM  (monkey in the middle, my MIL) and asked her to get the flu shot or she wouldn’t be able to hold LO until flu season is over. MitM told us that babies get sick so LO is going to get sick and it won’t be anyone’s fault. so DH doesn’t reply.  (read last posts for the FULL story) before we asked her to get the shot, she invited us over to carve pumpkins. we didn’t go. 

and the next day she sends him “i’m so glad you all didn’t come over yesterday. BIL2  is so sick” “i didn’t know he was sick til 4:30 this morning” “there must be a bad stomach virus going around three referees and two kids on his team have been out sick”

***EXCUSE ME. you KNEW BIL2 had been exposed to people who have been sick and STILL invited us over? man fuck you***

so i told DH “yeah that’s exactly our fucking point. DH the most fucked up part about this is that she said “three referees out two kids in his team sick” DH she knew. she KNEW BIL2  was exposed to all those sick people. and she STILL asked you to bring LO over. DH she doesn’t care about her or what could happen to her. “

and he was like “i know” 

so i was like nope i’m not doing it anymore. she needs to finally be called out on not respecting us. she’s done ENTIRELY too much. i’m not letting you rug sweep this this time. so he grew his spine. he sent her this :

“Hey if you don’t agree with our parenting choices that’s fine.  We’re her parents so we get to make these decisions. No one has to agree with them because she’s not their child. We don’t think it’s cool that you agree to respect our rules, and then complain about them or try to tell us we’re wrong. Because that’s not really respecting them. Both times you have agreed, but you’ve also blocked me, tried to guilt trip me, basically said the rules shouldn’t apply to you, and tried to tell us nothing we do will work. No one else seems to have an issue with our rules. We told you your actions would prove to us if you respected us as parents and based on your actions it seems like you don’t. At the end of the day she’s our daughter and you can either support and actually respect us or not be in her life. I’m tired of the passive aggressiveness and the guilt trips. And if you think I’ve been distant maybe it’s because of they way these things are handled time and time again. Things can’t continue like this, its too exhausting mentally. Things either need to change or we will excuse ourself all together. Again I want a relationship with you, but you have to treat me like an adult. I’m allowed to have feelings and decision of my own. I’m sorry if this message hurts your feelings but my little family is my number one priority. “


she said “exactly what rules have i broken?” “What did i do? I told you that the boys were sick and that i was glad you did not come over to carve pumpkins” “what actions have i taken to make you think that?”

so he said “We never said you broke any rules. You haven’t. It’s your actions that have caused us to feel this way. You do agree to respect our rules. But your actions after you say that  show us that you don’t respect us as parents.”


man. she TATTLED to her husband. 


so FIL (sweet sweet just very much yes fil) texted DH and was like “hey can i call you? i promise i won’t lecture you”

so we were like yeah ok let’s go

so DH talked on the phone and i listened in. and seriously? this man gets it. 100%. 

apparently he sat her down after she tattled to him and they had a LONG conversation about how she’s fucking wrong. 


on the phone he was like”i completely understand where you’re coming from. i read over all the messages from the past two days and you’re completely right. we don’t have to agree with your choices we can think they’re dumb or great or whatever but it doesn’t matter. what matters is that it’s what you guys think is best for your family and we need to say okay. She doesn’t have to like it but if she’s gonna bitch she can do it to me not y’all or on facebook because it doesn’t matter what she thinks.  I think she still want to be you mom, which she is, but she needs to treat you like an adult because you are one. She hasn’t gotten that through her head yet. I told her that the only people who matter to you right now is you, OP and LO. that is your main focus and it should be. just like her main focus should be the four people who live in our house. You’re not intrested in the boys sports or what we do everyday and you don’t care.You shouldn’t. That’s not important to you, what’s important is your family. She needs to back off. She has an overwhelming desire to be apart of your life and she doesn’t want to get pushed out. she said she doesn’t want to stop inviting y’all over because she doesn’t want y’all to feel like your not welcome. But i don’t think that’s ever going to be the case. She is pushing so hard that she’s pushing you all away and she needs to stop before it’s over. I think that y’all have gotten to the point where everything that has happened even back from 12-18 months ago has just piled up and it’s snowballed until now. i know y’all had to adress it because it needs to stop.i don’t really know what to do from here.  i think the best thing to do for now is if y’all want to come over or have something to say to us you probably send it through me and i can relay it to her or set it all up. I think honestly if we could start from a clean slate it would be for the best.”

so there it is. FIL gets it and pretty much put her in her place. we can only hope the message stuck. she hasn’t messaged him at all in the past two days ( she normally send him a ridiculous amount) so that’s good i guesss. i told DH I can’t start with a clean slate without an apology."
150,"This is my first baby but my parents 8th grandkid. My mother is a covert narc and I have no idea how she is going to ruin the first days with my newborn. The entire pregnancy has somehow been about her and I had told myself I had 9 months to be able to learn to not let her actions affect me......well now c-section is on friday and I can report I am zero percent closer to that being the case lol She is also staying at my house, but I have no idea how long for....I have gave into that because I need the help from my father to sort all my rescue animals but at least my husband will be here

My priority is making sure my baby is OK, and I feel like because I'm sitting worrying about my mothers next move something bad will happen. She even ruined my wedding (where I actually had a planned elopement) because i let her get into my headspace from her actions and made the whole thing about her.

This woman is literally the most insidious devil ever and her sole purpose in life is to look good to others. She MUST be liked by strangers and more importantly her younger siblings and posh ex-coworkers. I hate that I know that she does not, and is not, capable of loving me or my child. So the thought of her coming to the hospital to take photos of my baby makes my skin crawl.....because i know she will want to leave so quickly just so she can send the photos to her ex-colleagues and nosy family members who I don't have contact with, just so she looks the doting grandmother. It is such a silly thing, the photos thing but when I think about her taking a photo and sending it to people who I know are similar to her, I feel violated...like she is taking something from me. I can't psychoanalyse that lol

I am not sure if anyone will understandI am terrible at explaining but she is the weirdest person like, she loves to disrespect my boundaries and constantly tries to just paw  or do a quick swipe even! at my bump even though i have told her numerous times i dislike it. Then when I call her out she enjoys playing victim. Its so weird but i just KNOW she will try to force herself to be around when I am trying to breastfeed. I am highly sensitive to this because i am a sexual abuse victim from my now deceased brother......which my mother loves to try and invalidate and downplay or cry about randomly when she wants me to tell her she is a good mother. but thats all another story... but basically I feel like she loves to try and touch me in any way she can and then makes a joke out of it, despite me telling her I am NOT comfortable with being touched and apologise. I am in my 30s for chrissake anyway.

I have just found out from my other sis that the Golden Child sister and her have been arranging what time they are coming to visit me in the hospital etc and what day suits them best etc. without even asking me. I actually might just tell the staff no visitors anyway once I know how I feel lol ...it makes my blood boil that they talk about me without actually talking TO me.

I am so scared this all means something bad will happen because I am worrying about stuff that hasnt even happened yet and I don't even know if my baby is OK. I feel like a bad mother already because I am sitting her typing about my mother and not just focusing on my baby. Or maybe thats why I am, because I'm scared. I don't know, it just feels very scary and lonely and I don't want to be weak for my new daughter."
151,"My DH and I have been married for a year. It’s been great with him! About 5 months ago I found out I was 4 weeks pregnant with our first baby ever. Well my MIL doesn’t have any grandchildren so I thought she would be happy. She was to my surprise and acted like she wanted to be involved with the baby. I was actually happy because if you have a relationship with her, expect problems. At 12 weeks I decided to get genetic testing done to figure out the babies gender. I wanted to keep this to myself because I wasn’t close to MIL and SIL. When MIL found out, all hell broke loose. She started saying bad things about me, like always. And told DH he should find someone “better”. SIL went online to call me a “dumb stupid bitch”. Which is a nice named compared to all the others I’ve been called by her and MIL lol.. Its been over 3 months now since I’ve spoken to them. They’ve never liked me and have always been horrible to me for no reason. So, this was a perfect opportunity for me to cut them off. Well about 3 weeks ago my MIL calls DH. She tells him how I’m keeping him away from them.  MIL says that she knows I’m not going to let her near the baby. She also said, I quote, “It’s fine if your wife doesn’t let us near her baby because your sister is pregnant. And I have her baby to love so I don’t need yours.” That is exactly how she told DH his 18yo sister was pregnant. Which I find funny because 8 months ago they were calling me a slut, whore, etc. So let’s jump to what happened yesterday. I noticed DH feeling a little frustrated. I approach him and hugged him for 5 minutes before asking what was wrong. He then tells me “My mom and sister invited my ex fiancé to my sisters birthday party. Why would they do that? They would rather invite her than me and my wife. It’s not like we would have gone, but it’s crazy how 3 months ago they sat there talking bad about my her. Saying how trashy she was and calling all sorts of names. Now they want to be best friends with her to get back at us?”  Okay, that caught me off guard. But honestly I’m so glad I have a reason to no longer ever have them around me or my baby girl. My husband has finally seen how wicked they are. And it feels so good to cut them off permanently. I hope my daughter never has to go through what I’ve been through with DH family. They can disrespect me all they want, but come at my baby and it’s game over for them. I will make sure they don’t know when I have my baby, I will not send them pictures when she is born and I DO NOT want them around her. They’re the kind of people that would purposely hurt because they hate me so much. I’ll never understand how someone can be so evil and wicked. 😓"
152,"I just need to rant for a minute. 

My mom is THE MOST negative person I've ever met. I dyed my hair, first thing she said was ""that looks disgusting"" when i was brainstorming names for my child they were all ""gross, ugly, nasty, stupid"" when I tell her anything regarding my life at all its ""stupid"" or ""dumb"". I'm serious. There literally is NO positivity whatsoever. I just bought a house and when I was showing her around the only thing she said was ""it's pretty small"". 

Anyway, this post isnt about that. Above everything, my mother likes to talk shit about food. I like to make food and post it on social media every once in a while. I'm a foodie, a cook, and I like showing my work off. If it isnt something she personally would eat (ie: fried chicken, spaghetti, or pork chops) she ALWAYS comments something negative. ""Gross"" ""nasty"" ""ew"" ""that looks disgusting"" I've held my tongue for YEARS about it even though it obviously takes its toll on me and is extremely discouraging and depressing. But today I lost my shit. I was scrolling through facebook, when I see a post from my aunt. She posted a picture of an Italian soup she made. And of course, my mother comments on it and says, ""gross"". My aunt replies and says it was yummy, to which my mother replies ""nope, it looks slimy"" IT. LOOKS. SLIMY. 

I fucking lost it. I commented and asked her if she knew how fucking disrespectful she was. If it made her feel good about herself to put others down about the food they make and are proud of. I told her that just because she has the palette of a two year old doesnt mean she gets to hate on everyone else about the things they like. She didnt respond but a few minutes later she posted a thing about ""people judging you when they dont even remotely have their shit together"" I find that ironic when ALL SHE FUCKING DOES IS JUDGE PEOPLE. 

FUCK. Okay. End rant. 

I hate my mom."
153,"Bit of background, when I was growing up my mom was an undiagnosed and unmedicated bipolar (she did not recieve her official diagnosis until I was 12) and as such she wasn't always capable of being a good parent. My older brother got most of the attention, and still does honestly. He's not a GC exactly, he certainly got in trouble a lot, but sometimes it was like she only had one kid, or that she couldn't tell us apart. For example, if he didn't like something then clearly I didn't or wouldn't like it either. Like when he got put in Boy Scouts. He hated it, and didn't apply himself at all and got into all sorts of fights until mom pulled him out. About a year later I wanted to join a Girl Scout troop or some sort of equivalent (campfire girls, fireflies, etc) but wasn't allowed to because my brother had not liked it and had not wanted it so clearly I wouldn't either. He was put in sports and music classes and a special art program and quit all of them, and since he quit all of his extracurriculars I was never allowed to join anything even though I begged for it. It wasn't just extracurriculars though, she refused to go to PTA meetings and school festivals because he didn't want her to go to his, she wouldn't listen when I was being bullied in school because he never had any issues with bullies, even food was a point of contention because if he didn't like something then I wasn't allowed to eat it either. It was always about him when we were kids, and it's still like that today though we have made a few inroads towards her realizing that I am a unique and separate entity from my brother. Fast forward to now, she's mentally more stable and recently married a great guy with a seven year old daughter who is now my SS. They live on the otherside of the country so every other day my mom calls me to chat about their lives and how they're doing. I'm really happy for her but lately every phone call has been some new bit of news about my SS and how excited my mom is that SS has joined girl scouts, or that she's signed up to run a booth at SS's school fair next week, or how SS is starting ballet in the spring etc and it's just so great that she can finally do all these things that she never got to do with me. She's convinced herself somewhere along the line that the reason she never did them with me was because I didn't want to and I don't know how to tell her that this is incorrect. Everytime we talk about my childhood she either doesn't remember any of it or puts a massive guilt trip on me and frankly I don't want to deal with the confrontation. I also don't know how to tell her how hurtful and frustrating it is to hear about all these things, or how to express that once again I have been relegated to a non-entity in her life over another sibling. To make matters worse she's always telling me how wonderful it is that she gets to help raise my SS who is on the ASD spectrum because she already did such a great job raising me while I was growing up on the spectrum without us even knowing it (I was not officially diagnosed until after my daughter was born because girls weren't typically considered ""autistic"" when I was little). She really has no idea how hard I worked to take care of myself when she was too busy dealing with my brother or just flat out ignoring my problems. She doesn't understand what I was struggling with back then, but because I turned out alright clearly it was her doing. I don't know, am I just being irrational here? I want her to be happy, I want her to enjoy raising my SS, and I want my SS to be happy too, but damned if it doesn't feel like a slap in the face everytime she calls. Advice welcome, if y'all have any to give."
154,"I will try to make this succinct as this could end up a rambling rant.

In a nutshell, my DH is finally out of the FOG with his JNMIL and is seeing her for what she is- a covert narc with a mean streak to cause tension and jealousy between him and his siblings. He is dealing with the possibility that she is the reason they aren't close.

\*\*A little context:\*\*  
Every year without fail for about the last 15 or so years (we've been married 9) his mom brings his sisters (GC and  SIL #2) on a ""girl's trip."" These ""girls"" are now well over the age of 30. Nothing wrong with that in theory. But, here is where it goes waaaay off of the bullshit meter. At first these used to be trips around the area, a short drive and a nice hotel for a long weekend- or a spa day. In the last 10 years they have gotten MUCH more extravagant. I'm talking 5 star hotel, flying first class, international week-long trips. Did I mention FIL pays for the whole thing &amp; they pay for none of it- nothing, nada, zip.

They pretty much are getting to see the world for free while him and his brother are supposed to be cool with it because the parents don't offer the same thing to the sons. It's the old- you were raised with privilege so how dare you speak up like this isn't fair. It's total guilt bullshit. I no longer feel hurt that I'm never included as well because Im not ""blood."" I wouldn't want to spend a full day with my JNMIL anyways- I know better now. Even more terrible is that they blast the family text thread (including inlaws) with photos of everything that they do and see and brag about it. Soooo- we're all supposed to cheer them on with this? It's such an obvious tactic to play favorites in the family that it nearly makes me sick to see DH's face when these texts comes in. He actually called JNMIL out on the absurdity of it last year after she was going on and on about all these places they've seen that are so amazing at dinner one evening with the two of us. Then she had the gall to tell him that we should ""be sure to save up our money to see all these places because these are all 'must see' destinations in global travel.""

This year will be different though. Here's the thing– After finding out she's a covert narc through therapy– He's not hurt anymore, he's pissed. The next ""girl's"" trip is being planned and I would like to know how we handle it. Greyrock? Call them out on their bullshit? Or subtly mention how absurd it is to do this sort of extravagant gift-giving if it's not inclusive to the whole family? I am having a hard time thinking we may just have to swallow the pill. Sometimes I want to go full on mega bitch when I hear them talk about it. In the past, I've heard them complain while they are planning it that ""they aren't getting to fly first class this year."" Seriously? They were arguing about this with FIL in front of siblings that have never and will never be invited to these types of things. I'm clueless on how to deal with this. Advice needed.

EDIT: Advice flair/grammar. Thank you all!"
155,"So, my MIL had a grandma shower thrown in her honor the same day as my baby shower...which caused her to put an early end time on all of my shower invites she made. This caused some issues with my mom and step mom, my mom drove 7 hours to come to my shower and was looking forward to having a bunch of time with everyone, but when the invites came out with an ending time it kind of hindered that. She also made hand made favors that my MIL tried to take to her grandma shower right after. It’s been really bothering me because I feel like she as more or less taking over the day and making it about her, which really hurt my feelings. She knew what day her friends were planning it for and didn’t say anything about maybe doing another day. I also think a grandma shower is a bit crazy in and of itself, I do not see the point. My MIL also decided to send me photos of everything she got at her shower, which felt really braggy and I did not appreciate it. 

I can’t help but feel like with every turn of this pregnancy my MIL has been taking away special moments, I’d get into it but my previous post got picked up by Yahoo and I am NOT ok with that. I feel I may just be over sensitive at this point, but I also feel like she is just fucking insane and needs to take a major step back."
156,"Hey again, suddenly I can't stay away. 

Trigger warning - Slight mention of domestic abuse

My last post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dkl3el/this\_older\_woman\_and\_new\_games/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dkl3el/this_older_woman_and_new_games/)

Another update to who I am, hello I’m ImmediateSituation who’s ex-mil is known as This Older Woman or TOW. I have three kids and two of those are TOW’s grandchildren and a lot of shit went down especially after my husband died. The cast here in children are OS - Older Son, DD - Daughter and YS - Younger Son. DD and YS are twins.

Anyway, firstly I forgot to mention OS in my last update! He graduated school and is now in Australia starting the training for his ideal career path. He is living alone at the moment in the house we plan to live in and so far is doing well even though he misses his own partner (is schooling still here in the US) and wants his siblings to come to Australia like last month never mind on our time scale. He does say hi though people. 

Okay onto TOW. 

So I was dropping DD and YS off at school today (update to this YS managed an hour of crying loudly before the school was like, you need to take him home again as this is destressing to him but also everyone surrounding him) when my lawyer finally informed me they had found flying troll Saturday but was informing me now of what seems to have happened. 

The current story, take this with buckets of salt as I have, TOW once she got out of jail moved in with her boyfriend who apparently has a record for domestic abuse and was out on tag. Lovely choice in men everyone. Anyway, the reason she has ran away is boyfriend got angry and hit her multiple times according to troll. Boyfriend claims TOW has been abusing him financially and physically during their time together and boyfriend had kicked her out of the house due to this abuse. 

His address was TOW's last known residence and boyfriend is no ""grass"" so didn't tell their parole officers that she's done a disappearance act. TOW was staying with Troll in her car as Troll is once again homeless but two people in a small car didn't work out too well. Troll had left TOW at a homeless help centre as she should have been able to re-register her current address and be put forward for housing...

Apart from spoiler alert she hasn't. 

No one knows of her location right now and an arrest warrant has been issued so if she is stopped by police she will likely go back to jail for breaking the terms. 

Update to troll, she has been served with papers and we will hopefully go back to court sooner than later as we plan to move in late November. 

My ask here is anyone got any possible advice to try and get my YS to get back used to school. I'm questioning should I go with him into school and stay with him for a while or consider going back to home schooling him?"
157,"I posted the other day about how we set a boundary around gifting with JNMIL, who is historically an overindulgent passive aggressive gifter with DH and our three small children. 

We stated that they are only to give one item per child, per birthday/holiday. She made a show of telling ME that she would “honor” my “request” on a family FaceTime call, weeks after DH had privately had the gifting boundary convo with her. 

She always used to get them a zillion presents a month or two early via amazon. This time, since we set the boundary, she instead shopped brick and mortar and they sent it out on TUESDAY with no tracking, for our daughter’s Saturday birthday. 

Well, it turned up on our doorstep today, two days after the birthday (the lateness is a first).

Box contents:

-One winter coat for daughter

-One fancy party dress for daughter

-One t shirt for eldest Golden Grandson 

-NOTHING for lost child baby (8 months old)

Soooo... I don’t even know what to say. It’s like she’s playing chicken with our boundaries. 

DH will address it with her... we welcome input from you all. 

I’m just... I don’t know. Just wow. I guess I thought the lateness would be the eff you, but that the box would only contain one item. (I know, I know. I’m learning.)

Also just for context she is severely JustNo and so is FIL. They are both narcissists.

Edit for clarity and formatting."
158,"It's been some time since I posted about my mum, Squawky Seagull (I had other posts but I deleted them). All you need to know is she is *loud* - and I'm not good with loud sounds.

Earlier this week I told her that she talks to me like I'm trash. Her response? ""Yeah, that's because you are.""

I dunno if it's karma, but Squawky is sick at the moment. I should feel bad... But I just feel bitter. Any time I've been sick I've been yelled at for faking it or using it as an excuse to be lazy - even when it was obvious with snot flowing and my voice lost. I usually end hiding in my room afraid to ask for anything because I know it'll come with drama.

But Squawky has been screeching all day like someone's about to stab her. Just out of nowhere she'll start screaming ""HELP ME!"" and it's fucking heart-stopping. And if she isn't practicing her audition for a horror movie victim, she'll whistle like she's trying to call a dog.

We have a doctor coming in soon. I'm almost hoping they send her off to the hospital just so I can get some peace."
159,"So... Mother met my SO when he visited. It went...well. The woman who would usually have a strong if complaints she moment someone is out the door couldn't think of anything. Her reason? Well... It was only one day.

He was pretty damn amazing, I tell you. I miss him right now but looking ahead.

So... While I was visiting him, So became D(ear)H!!! This was a couple months ago and I apologise for lack of update guys, but I'm so freaking happy. It has definitely made the distance harder, but we can also start working on changing that (paperwork got filed last month!!!) and a year or two to go.

Thing is, friends know, his family knows... My family? He doesn't want to tell them and have them hate him and I don't want to tell them and deal with all the crap that follows. How could we do this without them? How could we not tell them? It's so unfair. (Both parents have said the same about other family members who eloped. So...) I am NOT telling them that I'm moving abroad until I move. The guilt trip is not going for my mental health. 

Hubs is visiting again soon. We are seeing them for one day of his visit. What should we do? Honestly, they make me feel like a child and have always been dismissive of my mental health issues. I hate the feeling of we are sneaking around, but likewise, it's so nice just not having to deal with it all.

Previous posts for some context."
160,"This is a throwaway account, as family members know my other account. 

When I first got married I was excited about the possibility of having children. I don’t currently want any now, because I’m still getting college and career squared away (21F). I’ve only been married for about 10 months and in those months I’ve been traumatized by my MIL so much that I don’t want kids anymore, because of the possibility that she will insist on seeing me and abuse my children. She has repeatedly shown that she is an incompetent caregiver (doesn’t believe in car seats) has physically abused DH (21M) and mentally abused all of her children. DH is still in the FOG, and obviously doesn’t know who to put first or even what he wants, which is difficult when discussing things and making plans, because one conversation with her and he wants to see his family again and do “family” things. Even though she has lied to both of us, physically abused both of us, and I am all prepped to go NC, she’s still inserting herself into our lives. 

Right now never having children just seems like the only possibility. I don’t know how to fix it or stop visiting her. I don’t want to “rock the boat” but she’s already capsized it. It’s only been 10 months and I never want to speak to her again. Am I wrong to feel this way? How can I even go about talking to my D(mostly dear)H about this?


UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who has commented and helped with resources, advice, truth, and emotional support. I appreciate every bit of it, and will try and answer all of your messages as soon as I can. My DH accidentally stumbled upon this post, (and knew it was me) and he has come to terms with a lot of problems that we’ve had. He now understands what kind of position he’s put me in, and we are working on finding some help and a better way of communicating with each other. Thanks again!"
161,"Long story short. I am NC with my JNM, sometimes Yes JND due to a life time of physical and emotional abuse. 
I am unintentionally NC with my brother (B) and oldest sister (OS) because I refuse to put in all the effort for a relationship and they are too lazy or ""busy"" as they put it. 

Anyway. 

B is getting married. Announced a month-ish ago and didn't tell anyone. JNM called to tell me, voice dripping in passive agressiveness, the happy news. 

DH had a birthday this past weekend and of course everyone we are NC with messaged or called. We didn't answer, read or pick up. 

JNM decided to message me and DH today to wish him a happy birthday and to tell me that B is getting married this Friday. 

I am going to be changing my number this week. My business is going to potentially take a hit but at this point I can't afford a second number and the anxiety with her calling and texting is too much. DH is still keeping his number but is going to block her. 

My therapist says that I've been through more than most people would have been through at my age and that it is no wonder I keep my phone on silent if she won't respect my boundaries. 

Now I'm wondering if I should just break NC to lose my ever loving mind on JNM so she will know that her not respecting this one request (not to contact me unless she is apologizing for what she did and is actively in therapy or has a plan to make things better) she has not done anything. It probably won't do anything, at this point, I don't think NC is working. Neither would vlc."
162,"BG: My husband and I recently got married last August. He is an only child and his father passed away about 16 years ago. After his father passed MIL became co-dependent on her son (in my view and his family in a unhealthy way). He ended up leaving his country to study abroad where we met, eventually we visited her (vice versa) and things seemed fine when i was ""just his GF"" as she told ppl. lol FF 3yrs later we got engaged and all of a sudden she couldn't stand me and told her friends and family I was controlling him, would put her in a home when she got old, wanted money and am trying to take him away from her. I tried my best to ignore her but she went too far when she began saying I was too dark to be with her son and talked about our unborn children we might have. I told fiance I wanted no part of her so I went LC but did not interfere with their relationship as he is an only child. I told him my family loves and respects him, I believe just being cordial with me is something she could do.

While pregnant JUSTNOMIL 's family demanded I make amends with her (she didn't know I was pregnant). She did not attend our wedding (we sent out Save the Dates a year and half in advance to everyone and the rest of his family came) as she said she was unwell. We went NC after that. They believe because she is older that is up to me to make things right. I asked DH to announce to his family like I did with mine (I flew home). He told many but not MIL and I believed that he should be the one to do so. DH figured why bother...she was not going to be happy so why ruin the last few months of our pregnancy. DH ended up telling her 2 months before I gave birth. Her reaction was as if someone had just died. 

FF our LO is now 3 months and JUSTNOMIL has not met the baby. And her family pretty much hates me.  AIL stopped by our house randomly and for 30 mins talked about me not trying to be a part of the family, that his MIL was there before me and to know my position. Well DH is not a confrontational person and sat there stunned, this is an aunt he is/was close with. He ended up asking her to leave. There is a family chat and somehow I have torn DH and his mother apart. I never thought I would be a DIL to such a spiteful woman and I do not want our baby around her especially since she does not respect me or acknowledge I exist but wants access to our child. Is this wrong of me?"
163,"Obligatory on mobile and first post warning.
Ok, this happened most recently back in May (Victoria day weekend I think), but it kinda happens every time we spend time with her.
Backround: So my SO's family has a cottage up north, well out of the city. SO and I have been together for 10 years this winter, married for 4. I have 3 sons (10, 6, and 2), the younger 2 by my SO (he treats them all the same, she less so, which is a different story).

Every so often my JNMIL insists she needs to see the children, and this weekend in particular, we should all go up to the cottage. It is lovely up there. Now, everytime we spend time with this woman, she does whatever she can to override myself and SO as parents. 
A child asks for a snack right before dinner, I say no as I want them to actually eat dinner. JNMIL will immediately provide said child with a large snack of whatever child wants. Be it chips, or s'mores, sometimes it is grapes, which I am slightly less frowny on. 
This behavior leads the children to asking JNMIL for everything. And instead of telling children to ask their parents (who are normally within 10 feet, it is a small cottage), she will take charge and parent them. 
And every night at the cottage, she puts myself and SO outside in the bunkie to sleep, keeping the young ones inside the main building with her.
And without fail, by the last day of the weekend, JNMIL is passive-aggressively remarking that we should be taking care of our children, and answering their questions. We should've been the ones awake with the children, not her. This happens every single time! But if we try and step in to take care of our kids (aside from diaper changes with the youngest), ""Grandma"" just wants to spoil the boys and we should just let her make those choices. ""It's only for the one night""..... and I think the hardest part for me is that she is so polite about it.

Edit: thank you for the inputs so far. Yes I will admit I am a bit of a doormat, allowing her to bulldoze over me. I have some childhood trauma that makes it difficult to stand up for myself, and I would rather my husband talk to his mom because she already dislikes me. I will be trying some of these suggestions next time."

UPDATE: Thank you to every last person who commented and shared advice. The majority rule was that my husband is an ass and, well, I’ll admit he’s clueless. I also came from a semi-emotionally abusive upbringing so I understand needing to fully come out of the fog. After I received enough comments I explained to him that I had written this post and why, and then had him read it. He was in tears long before we got to the comments, which he read every one of. We are working on boundaries and steps to repair what’s been broken and there’s going to be a lot of change over the next several months. It’s been amazing realizing we ARE on the same team and our spines are getting a bit sturdier every minute. My husband agreed to boot his brother from the car insurance after reading the comments saying it was irresponsible (because I guess me talking to the insurance company directly wasn’t enough!) and we are telling his mom NO to Halloween (and mine too, for that matter). My husband told me that I need to be super firm and clear on the things that are important to me and he will always have my back, because part of the issue is that I’m a wishy washy people pleaser which results in confusion for him. We are on the road to fixing this, and we even discussed couples counseling which we agreed we aren’t ready for but are BOTH open to if push comes to shove. Again, thank you all for your advice!!!

This is a really long and poorly written post. I have a LOT to get off my chest after months of this. I feel sick with anxiety all the time. I’m hoping to get some feedback that I can not only use to cope and deal with these situations but that I can also read to my husband so that he can get some outside perspective. I think we both feel at this point that I’m going crazy. Forgive me for the poor organization. 

I (25/F) finally have my rainbow baby (a child born after pregnancy loss, in my case 2 losses) and he is perfect. He’s 9 months old and I adore him. My husband (25/M) works his ass off to provide for us and is an amazing dad and spouse. I feel though, since we’ve been married, my feelings come second to his mom’s. 

My MIL has been an issue from the beginning. Long story short, my husband and I have been together for 10 years (high school sweethearts) and through the relationship she’s not always treated me the best. In fact, the only times we have had a conflict free relationship are the times I keep my mouth shut and plaster a smile on my face. Which has become increasingly more and more difficult since the birth of our son. 

Main issues we’ve had since the birth of my son: 

A. She insists on calling my son “her baby” or “our baby”. Fuck that, but whatever. Not worth the argument. 

B. I typed up a list of expectations to give to both sets of parents while I was pregnant because, honestly, I suck at confrontation, ESPECIALLY face to face confrontation. The list said basic things like “please get your TDAP...my doctor will do it for free!” “No one will be permitted at the hospital” “come over whenever you want just give us a call first!” And “no pics of our son on social media until we announce his birth”. She threw a temper tantrum. Like literally cried, said I was mean, and made me feel so back asswards and guilty I basically folded like a house of cards and backed off. Everyone did get their TDAP, I wouldn’t back off of that, but she did end up parking her ass on the hospital couch for all THIRTY SIX hours of my labor and when it ended in a very emotional and traumatic emergency C-section, she made sure her and her mom in law were at the hospital every day of my stay for literally HOURS AT A TIME. (At one point taking him froM me and holding him for 3 hours straight, ignoring my pleas for him to be given back to me. My husband claimed “he had no idea that was going on”)

C. Since his birth she’s wormed her way into every major event I’ve looked forward to. I grew up relatively poor and looked forward to the simple traditions my parents put together. I vowed to be a super “extra” mom when I had kids and literally have planned out traditions and things I wanted to do with my family since I was like ten years old. I definitely feel like extended family should get to experience holidays and milestones to an extent, but so far I’ve felt completely robbed of my son’s firsts. 
     - first Valentine’s Day my son was only a few weeks old and my husband and I had a quiet dinner out with him. We came home to find that she had left Valentine’s Day cards out in the rain (if she had put them by the front door they’d be dry). When my husband called her to see what was up she accused me of ignoring her and withholding information about her grandson. I was super confused since she only ever communicates with me via group chats with my husband and various family members. She was crying on the phone. Come to find out her phone wasn’t working or sending texts properly. She still found a way to blame me and didn’t talk to me for days. 
     -First Easter she refused to do a combined lunch with my family so that my husband and I could do something one on one with our son. We ended up doing lunch with my parents and dinner at her house and didn’t get to do what I wanted to do. 
     -first Fourth of July I insisted we do a combined bbq because we were not splitting the holiday between families. She came over, pouted the whole time, and kept taking my son into a different room by herself, going as far as taking him from me when he was crying. 
      
Halloween is coming and is a holiday I don’t feel needs to involve in-laws. At the beginning I told my husband we were NOT involving family for Halloween. My MIL invited herself trick or treating back in AUGUST and I decided to give my husband time to handle shit himself. The more I step up the worse the relationship gets. Aside from her shit she’s a good grandma and I do not want to push her away completely. I don’t feel like I should always be the one who has to be the “bad guy”. My husband expressed that he felt uncomfortable about it and “sad” so I decided to suck it up and just go with it, deciding I could handle giving up yet ANOTHER thing that matters to me if it meant my husband didn’t have to have that conversation. (On that subject, my husband also put his 21 year old brother on our car insurance policy at MIL’s request because he was in a car accident a few months ago and couldn’t afford to carry his own policy. This wasn’t his first accident. He drives drunk frequently and the last accident he was in happened because he was texting. My husband did it without talking to me. When I found out I was furious and demanded he tell his brother no and he got upset, said that he’s afraid I will never let him talk to his family again ((which by the way is RIDICULOUS. I am the only one who attempts to make plans with his family. My husband never texts or calls his mom and if it weren’t for me I don’t think they’d ever talk! When I got upset about him saying this he claimed he “didnt remember saying that)) and months later his brother is STILL ON THE POLICY. 

She asked if we could all go to a pumpkin patch which was another little sore spot for me because I have never been and thought it would be so cool to go as a little family. I told my husband that if she came with us it was important to me that she was a bystander for the most part. Nope. She snatched my son from me as soon as we got there, reluctantly handed him back to me to take a couple pictures and ride a train ride, and then snatched him back to go pick out his first pumpkin. My husband didn’t say or do anything. I literally cried all night about it. It wasn’t even so much the pumpkin patch but that, yet again, my husband spared his mom’s feelings at the expense of my own. (I know I need to shine up my own spine but my mom destroyed my dad’s relationship with his mom and growing up with that contention has made me super aware of not wanting to do that to my own spouse). 

Since that incident I’ve decided no, I DONT want to do Halloween with the in-laws in ANY capacity. I want to get to experience the holiday with my son without people snatching him or trying to push my husband and I away so they can have alone time with our son. I’m so exhausted by this all. 

(Another source of contention I Would love everybody to weigh in on is babysitting. My mom watches my son on the very rare occasion and it’s genuinely for maybe 20 minutes at most. She has in the past watched him for a couple of hours so me and my husband could go to dinner, but when that became an issue with my husband because I didn’t want his mom babysitting, we put a stop to it and haven’t had a night out in months. The reason I don’t want her babysitting if she doesn’t have any respect for my boundaries as a mother (feeding my son things he’s not capable of eating, thinking I’m overbearing for not wanting her to kiss my son on his face during flu season, etc, and they have a very aggressive dog and a matter how many times I ask that they keep my son away from the dog there’s always a run in and situation whenever we go over there. However I know it will continue to be an issue as he grows) 

Thank you for making it this far. Genuine and honest feedback is so welcome and wanted."
165,"This is going to be a long one and you'll probably be annoyed along with me.

This year has just been testing my patience. Mainly, MIL and all her BEC moments. The last time I saw her and FIL was before the post I made about the chocolate incident where she flipped out on me, called me crazy, and went to throw her “rage cooking” tantrum because I said “no thank you” and told her I didn’t like chocolate or want anything when she was starting up her episode. This may seem as though I said it in a mean way, but it honestly wasn’t.

After talking to DH later, I found out that when he went to coddle her in the kitchen after I was letting her stew, she asked him why I couldn’t just accept it and throw it away. ***Why couldn’t she just stop giving me excessive crap when we’ve already told her multiple times that it was an issue and making me uncomfortable***\*?\* He also told me he met her for lunch and she was worried about our relationship. He summarized what she said as “She doesn’t know what to do and why it’s not working because she’s never had someone not let her have her way or do what she wants.” Apparently, she planned on just throwing another gift at me to make it better or something along those lines because DH told her “Whatever you’re planning, don’t.”

I had already dropped the rope and was minding my own business. He told me about this meeting right after she had sent me a “Long time no message, are you ok? Is everything ok?” text. So I decided to just send her a letter since she asked him why our relationship wasn’t working and I'm not into pretending with her. There were 3 letters between us and they’re long so summarizing is the best I can do.

**Letter 1 (me)**: I’m excited to visit you guys next weekend, but to better understand each other, there are boundaries I have that would make me feel more comfortable around you.

\* Gifts only on special holidays. We’ve discussed this and ignoring it tells me that you don’t care that I’m uncomfortable. The gifts seem more controlling than about nice gestures. If they were, there wouldn’t be such an issue with me being uncomfortable and declining or you throwing a tantrum over it. (DH already told me she used to fight with both GMILs about them over gifting her to the point GMIL2 -maternal- would start yelling. She finally worked something out with GMIL1 and they eventually got along after 15 years because she doesn’t do that anymore. Point is, it was a one up controlling thing that she absolutely hated and now she’s trying this game with me.)

\* Being told what to do. My mother already raised me to make my own decisions. I’ve felt that you overstepped and tried to tell me what to do with my body/what I eat/my uterus/etc. as if I cannot survive without you. I moved here to be with my husband, not to find a new mommy to take care of me.

\* I do not appreciate being hit on the shoulder when I do not do what you want. We are taught at 5 years old not to do that and, we are raised to hit back. When you do this, I can not respect you as someone older than 5.

\*My body is mine. Your customs are yours only and do not belong on my body.

\* The biggest boundary is when I say no. You told me you would respect that, but it only seems that way when you get what you want. When I’ve told you no, you threw tantrums (I brought up the tantrum over not sitting on a blanket, in the mall, the chocolate but she’s thrown more). I am not used to dealing with adults who act like that.

We do not fully understand each other yet or our roles in each other’s lives but no one is forcing me to have a relationship with you. I know I made no effort to speak to you, but honestly, why would I? My family and friends don’t treat me like this so why would I make the effort to allow you to treat me that way? If I have a relationship with you it is because I choose to.

**Letter 2 (MIL):** We were only helping. You felt like I was always there, we stopped. You felt that maybe I call you too much, we stopped. You said no gifts, we stopped. So we, or me, were SO disrespectful. Chocolate is not a gift. It means we are thinking of you and like you. I only tapped you all those times **(*****It was harder than a tap. She doesn’t full on smack me or anything hard but it’s definitely not something I do with my friends. Then there’s the time I got jabbed in the face with an elbow because she went to do the same thing and I’m honestly questioning if it actually was an accident*****)**. The chocolate situation was kiddie from you and I was only mad for a few minutes and didn’t try to cause drama. I was only sad for a couple of minutes when you wouldn’t let me buy you earrings. When I was asking you **(*****pestering*****)** about buying you sausages, that was only conversation so I’m SO disrespectful. I hope my son was good mannered when you decided to marry him (***she acts like he’s a gift too***). My MIL did things I didn’t like but I would never allow myself to be so rude to them. Our relationship is in your hands now.

DH saw through the bullshit in that letter because his cute little ""WTF"" face was in full effect. All I had to say was “She is seriously trying to change the English language to avoid being at fault”. So he decided on his own to tell her he was translating the third letter and would have a talk with her. She pretty much told him I was rude for not accepting her gifts and writing her what I did because she put up with her elders **(Oh how dare I)**. Told him this is how they are and I was supposed to build a relationship with her. Told him that all this stuff happened in the past (*I try not to see her, why does she think that is*) and she wants to just forget and turn over a new leaf.

BUT, he came back with some of the FOG and an attitude. Although he doesn’t really care to be around MIL, he agreed that all that stuff happened in the past and he had coddled her because she didn’t understand and to prevent her from going off. So I sat him down and asked him what possible fucking reason does she have to go off on me for not accepting her crap even if she didn’t understand? Why the hell does an adult woman need to be babied so that she won’t have a tantrum? DH: I told her that that wasn’t ok.

Me: ok. So why am I rude for not accepting something when I already told her it was an issue?

DH: I asked her how you were rude. I told her that I just don’t see it as rude.

Me: Then what is the problem?

DH: You haven’t told her what you want.

Me: I did in the 3rd letter (which was sent before this convo. And she continues to ignore). I don’t expect an apology, but so far has she even admitted anything or gave any indication that this was going to change or is it just ""this is how I am""?

DH: *Wheels turning* …. No... she hasn’t *surprised face*. OK. Got it.

I didn’t understand that he was upset because I was only giving some effort at a relationship and he believes in trying harder or dropping it completely. No half assing . I thought he wanted me to have a relationship with them but he doesn't care. I’m not sure where being more than civil fits into his views but it seems like that counts as a relationship too meaning you chose a relationship and now have to put in more effort. He doesn’t care for her much but just puts up with them. I told him at the moment, I want none and now he seems to be about on his merry way.

**Letter 3 (me)**: I understand that you were trying to be helpful and gifting. I appreciated that but when it becomes excessive, someone tells you they’re uncomfortable, and you start getting angry over it, it’s no longer a sign of affection. Chocolates included. That’s not how you show someone you like them. You told me you like me and I didn’t forget or need to be bribed with candy every time I saw you. I’m not that insecure. But my concerns are with all my boundaries. I don’t have to accept things just because you are my MIL. I’m not you or GMIL1.  Those relationships have nothing to do with me and it’s not by responsibility to copy them. I’d tell my own mother the things I have told you. I don’t expect you to walk on eggshells, but a relationship requires 2 people. Not just me. It is possible to have a relationship the same way you would with people who you don’t think are your children by not going up to them and telling them what to do with their penises/uteri and not trying to mother them. You don’t get special permission to coddle people just because you popped out a child and live in a certain country. The only thing that you are telling me when you say “this is how we do things” is that the mothers here can only comprehend how to interact with children (I’ve met a few including my therapist who is creeped out by MIL so I assume it’s not true. MIL is just looking for a crutch). You’ve coddled me since I got here and this is why I’ve asked for space/no help/no gifts/stop trying to dress me (seriously, she even knew when I wasn’t wearing a perfume she bought me months before I met her, I guess she expected to meet me smelling like her?)/respect when I say no. FIL does it. Never even put his hands on me and I have no problems having a relationship with him or understanding he cares. He just speaks to me as if he has more roles in his life than being a dad. You can be nice to hang out with as well when you are not trying to coddle me. I’ve seen proof but I will not hesitate to call you out on your behavior. I’ll be clearer when I am feeling overwhelmed, but I expect you both to own your own behavior. You throw tantrums when you are told no and are way too pushy. I understand you’re excited but it’s uncomfortable. Just understand that I don’t want to be coddled and told what to do. Join us in activities instead of watching over us. It’s that simple. THAT is how we have a relationship.

So far, I’ve been enjoying the quiet and being busy getting ready for our big move. But my traitorous, good for nothing, little flub fingers decided to call her when I was putting my stuff away after a long day. This is why I favor my cheeks because they hang up on anybody, no questions asked. She texted that she missed my call and asking if I needed something or if I just wanted to hear her voice so I grey rocked and told her that was fine and it was an accident. Nothing but crickets after. I worked way too hard getting here to play baby for her just because she’s bored. I have no qualms with telling her exactly where she can go and what she can do with her chocolate. I have better things to do than to wait on her to understand that I’m not going to bend like FIL and DH do just because MIL is mad. I give no shits about the way she does things or her weak ass tantrums. My mom’s and mine would put her to shame but mom isn’t a JN.

Who knew venting here could clear up so much headspace. I think I'll name her Grooming Greta, if it's not taken, for the way she tries to make me a mini-her and gets irritated when I don't pick out the same things she would."
166,"Im ambivalent about advice cos it's an old story but feel free to chime in! 

I just read another post and it feels like the penny has dropped regarding my MIL.

After I set boundaries and spined up, she whined to my DH that she was afraid I didn't like her. I mean she's a thundering bitch who's negative and passive aggresive about everything, is a total snob, throws tantrums, talks behind my back, belittles out lifestyle choices and acts like we're 5 years old but apparently she thought I liked her... 

However it just dawned on my that she couldn't give a crap if I like her or not, she just wasn't used to being stood up to. DH, FIL and BILs all going along with her their whole lives has enabled this and her immediate response to someone saying ""no"" is to take it personally and DARVO like there's no tomorrow."
167,"Ex &amp; I (not engaged but long enough relationship) broke up a while ago, but this just came to mind:

My boy dog accidentally got my girl dog pregnant a week before he was scheduled to be snipped. Because of this we had 5 puppies that we had to find homes for, and we were basically giving them away for the price of the vet bills as long as we knew the people were good pet owners. 

Now! My Ex's mom (EXMIL for the purposes of this story) was very interested in these dogs. They're small apartment dogs and have a good temperament, so she was so enthusiastic! I had no problem with her, she was pretty on her game and had 2 other nice small dogs that were middle-aged and elderly, so a puppy might be welcome. It was all settled: she had first dibs on a girl puppy. Then the puppies were born! Woohoo! Everything is going good, I show her pictures when I see her (she was a professor at my school) and she's excited! She's gonna name her Baby Ruth. 

Then, around the time the puppies turned 4-6 weeks old, Ex tells me that I shouldn't give her the dog. He apparently was hoping I would come to this decision on my own (with no reason to do so) and tells me that she keeps her two dogs in a cage all the time, even when she's home. When the dogs aren't in a cage, they're gated into the kitchen. I'm on the fence at this point, because one dog is unable to control their bowels and the other is keeping it company? But he puts his foot down and says no dog for her. He apparently breaks the news to her and takes the blame, but she isn't having it ( I'm reporting all of this 2nd hand).

For the rest of the relationship she *hated* me. She would be polite to my face and other than that, Ex would make it clear that she had nothing nice to say when I was brought up as a topic. At one point, he came home to see his apartment door (he lived in an attached apartment above the house) covered in sharpie that said RIP RUTH. Mind you, she owned that door and it did not wash off. 

After this, she ended up getting a puppy. And when the vets told her that she shouldn't have (because her elderly dog was so sick and she should be focused on getting ready to put him down), she told the vets that the dog **had already died** so that they wouldn't scold her.

I'm not sure how the puppy is being treated now, as we aren't in contact, but I can't imagine she made a 180.

I mean, I didn't like the feeling of being hated by my boyfriend's mom, but I feel like the puppy (now named Maria) dodged a huge bullet."
168,"I flaired it ambivalent about advice but really... it’s been handled. My husband has shown his shiny, blinding spine and we handled it together! 

Man you guys... She’s just incredible. 

We put in our 60 day notice and started packing. Between packing, appointments, the mandatory overtime my husband has had to do... I find myself feeling like I wake up, blink, and all of a sudden it’s the end of the day. My husband and I are a great team, and my own family has rallied behind us to help pack and get stuff done. My SIL (who is sooo JUSTYES) came and helped me pack the girls’ room in its entirety and I can’t thank her enough for kicking ass that day. 

I was looking forward to my DH’s days off because it’s the first time since DD2 came home that had nothing scheduled at all. We had no appointments in over a month in a half. I have no idea how we managed that...since I’m not much of a planner at all.

When my husband’s days off came around, we got a text message the day before asking if they could come visit. Unbeknownst to me, DH said yes. When he told me they were going to visit the next morning, I got sad and then filled to the brim with anxiety. I truly was looking forward to having nothing to do, no one to go see, or having any expectations to maintain. 

I tried really hard, but in the end, I just couldn’t help myself. I told him how tired I was and how much I was looking forward to all of this and having two family days with no packing involved. Two days of family oriented fun. Maybe I napped and then he could nap. Maybe we could go outside on a hike. Maybe we could all sit on the couch and watch a movie together. Maybe I’d expend some energy for them if they came over and helped us pack, but I would not take time out of my day for them if they weren’t going to help. 

But then I took it all back. I saw the exasperated look, the desperation and anxiety that filled him to the brim as my words came out- if there is one thing he hates the most, it’s going back on his word, especially when it is his parents.

He sighed really heavily and I knew that it was time for me to suck it up and deal with Pity Patty and her visit. So I told myself that it is what it is and resort to gray-rocking the visit. 

A few hours went by, and my DH came up to me and set his phone down in front of me. He canceled the plans with his Dad. He said to me, “I didn’t realize it at first... but I’m exhausted. All this overtime has me beat and worn out. I don’t think I can handle my mom and dad in my current state. I... I think you’re right. A family day sounds wonderful, and so does a nap. If they wanna visit, they can help pack”. 

You guys... I was literally celebrating inside but I was as cool as a cucumber on the outside. 

In true fashion, Pity Patty began flooding my DH’s phone inbox, asking why she can’t visit and the like. She obviously didn’t want to help. My DH responded that he was tired and due to the overtime he had worked, he had only slept a span of 5-7 hours in two days and would love to nap and take a break. He expressed that he wanted to rest and recover and spend time with the girls... totally reasonable right? 

Wrong. 

Instead, she goes on the book of faces and reposts posts about Grandparents rights and memes about how she’s going to die soon. She finds pictures with words on it saying that we all should appreciate her while she’s alive because we’ll regret it once she’s gone. She then posted an original status, telling the book of faces world about how heartbroken she is, how no one has any right to tell her she has things to be thankful for, and she has been “kicked so many times” that she isn’t sure she can recover. My husband has her snoozed on the book of faces, so he can’t see it... however, he gave me the information to his account so I go on there just to see what she posts and what to expect. 

My DH’s inbox got messages from two different people- flying monkeys- asking what was going on between us and his mom, trying to get us to “resolve” it... like there isn’t SOME possibility that my husband was actually just tired and wanted to rest and relax?!

After some time I did start to feel guilty, but my DH said he wasn’t going to change his mind after all of this and promptly shut off his phone. We had a perfect, quiet Monday night. 

Tuesday was quiet as well. 

Wednesday, DD1 woke up, puking everywhere. Every time we changed her clothes, she’d puke again. We started feeling so bad. We wondered if it was a stomach bug or something more serious. DD2 had an early intervention evaluation later, as well as DH had to work 3-11. I wondered how I was going to handle all of it, but I decided I wasn’t going to worry about it too much and just operate on auto pilot- just do whatever I needed to do to get to the end of the day. My DH, on the other hand, used his FML because we decided that if DD1 wouldn’t stop puking, I could take her to the doctors while DD2 had her evaluation. 

We did not even think to say “hey Pity Patty, DH called off today, wanna come over?” We just kind of did whatever we needed to do. I made chicken soup and DH took both girls and cuddled up under a blanket on the couch until I was done. The therapists came, evaluated DD2, and left. DH and I packed a few things, did some laundry, and had a very productive day overall... and to be honest, I probably could not have done Wednesday without him. DD1 ended up not puking anymore and scarfed down the soup I made. She just had a little bug she needed to get out I suppose. 

Well... DH posted something on his book of faces, giving away the fact that he called off to take care of DD2 while I dealt with DD1... and then his phone blew up again. 

She started attacking my DH, saying that we were being mean and unfair, deliberately keeping the girls away from her, and that if she needed to, she’d come after us for Grandparents Rights. She said she “fought so hard” to see BIL’s DD1, and she would do the same for our girls (she didn’t have to “fight”- BIL has a custody agreement that BIL and SIL choose to include her in on when DD1 visits from Washington). She went on to tell us that we “didn’t understand” what her life was like and that we needed to spend more time with her and allow her to visit. “It’s been over 6 weeks since I’ve seen the girls!!!”

Cue major eye rolls from DH and I. 

We... didn’t understand? Didn’t UNDERSTAND?! 

WOMAN!!! 

If she wants to start talking about being understanding... 

She clearly doesn’t understand what it’s like to raise two children- one with special needs and health requirements- while packing up an entire apartment. Doesn’t understand that we have appointments for DD2 that are not just “check ups”. Doesn’t understand that every spare minute we have is used to pack or do chores. She uses the time frames as a blatant attempt to guilt trip us into a visit. 

The post was a mindless repost you guys. It was so stupid, and it had no forbearance to this next part.
She messaged my DH in response to his response to her on his post: 

“I hope you all feel better, I care very much about you all. You need to understand when you say things you think are funny or sarcastic it hurts my feelings. I don’t say things to hurt you. So please try and understand how I feel. You are going through a lot and I understand that, but you have no idea what is going on in people’s lives so try and be respectful. I love you.” 

My DH seemed to have had it at this point. He didn’t say anything at first. Just let it fester. 

Then she posted a status about how horrible we were. Things went from 0-100 really quick...

In the mean time, we get two messages from two different people (friends of Pity Patty) trying to intervene and “help remedy” the situation. Took everything in my power to not just have my DH tell them to fuck off. It’s none of their business what happens. 

DH texted back: 

“Take your own advice please. Going on Facebook, posting it’s the end of the world and having flying monkeys message me, says you don’t understand. Constantly reminding me of how long it’s been comes off as not only condescending but a very blatant attempt at a guilt trip. You say you get I have a lot going on, support me and show it with your actions. You’ve not once since I told you my situation offered to help me pack or move anything. And when I take a day for the sake of my mental health and for my daughters, you want to go post about not being able to see your granddaughters and make me and my wife out to be some villainous people with grand schemes of “denying your visitation rights”. REALLY rubs me the wrong fucking way. You love us and want to support us? Match the words”. 

Not a peep was made from her. I thought my husband did an amazing job in shutting her down, but deep inside, we both were waiting for what was coming next. 

Few minutes go by and FIL texts my DH. He says, “this has gotten out of hand. From the start you “have got this”. We’ve participated in all your previous moves when asked (this part is not true at all- we never asked them for help, they just decided to help on their own). When you told us of your decision to move, it was a total surprised, and stunned us. So we figured you “got this” too. We can’t know what you need if you don’t ask. I truly don’t know how to fix this... there’s so much anger. It seems for months now, you lash out at Mom and we don’t know what she’s done to deserve it”. 

Ya’ll... He’s referring to when DD2 was 2 days post open heart surgery and Pity Patty freaked because DH wasn’t giving her specific details other than “she’s doing really well”... I mean, why would we when she acted the way she did in the NICU? My DH was frustrated because when he wouldn’t answer immediately to her text, she’d follow with MORE texts, demanding why we weren’t answering. Maybe it’s because we were focusing on our daughter??? Like we should be???

Then she posts about how horrible 2019 has been and says that her heart can’t quite literally “take it anymore” and that her blood pressure is 200/85. Says that if things don’t start looking up soon or if she doesn’t get some “light” in her life, she’ll probably just die. Cue all her friends saying “come visit us!” And “my daughters would LOVE to have you as their grandma!” And my personal favorite, “You’re so strong, you’ve been through so much! You can do this! You’re an amazing grandma!”

Oh the eye rolls made on our part!

At this point, we both decide that enough is enough. My DH was feeding DD2 at this point, so while he was doing that, we crafted this message together:

“I need to not be vilified for taking a mental health day, for being mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted, and a day to focus on my daughters. I do not need Pity Patty going on Facebook and having her friends try to intervene in family matters. When mthdth and I moved in here, you did not get asked for help. You helped anyways and we were and are grateful. Now that we have made the decision to move based on financials, being surprised and stunned does not take away from the fact that moving requires a lot of time and energy. We are raising two girls while maintaining the current household, attending appointments that sometimes run over, AND packing, and somehow it has not occurred to either of you that entertaining or hosting during these past few weeks would be difficult? But on Facebook, mthdth and I are made the villains and painted out to be horrible because we have to focus on packing up and moving out of here instead of having company over? In addition to the other appointments and requirements needed for DD2? Instead, Pity Patty makes this all about HER and her health issues, her needs and her wants. Somehow, having my own life and my own family and not having the ability to stop to have company over makes US unreasonable, and I don’t have the patience or time to cater towards unrealistic expectations or those who claim they understand but do not. I am not lashing out at Pity Patty, and it’s really crazy for her to make it all about her. The fact is, my life is changing and has been for some time now. We don’t need pseudo support and words on Facebook. I have been and will always be focused on my girls and my family. Ever since I said “I do” to mthdth, there has been issue after issue, and there really is no basis for any of it. I have been building my own family, making decisions for my family that mthdth and I agree on TOGETHER and that seems to be an issue. The last few months has been a perceived “lashing out”, all because she wanted in-depth detail about DD2 being in the CICU post-op, and I expressed that I would very much rather focus on DD2 than be glued to my phone, giving attention elsewhere instead of on DD2 where it truly needed to be. I love you and I love mom. But the fact is, my life has been changing drastically since the day the pregnancy test turned positive for the second time. I won’t apologize for our choices or our actions. I wont apologize for putting my daughters health and my mental sanity first; it doesn’t mean I love you any less. But as I said to mom, I don’t appreciate being vilified for doing what I believe is best. I recognize how long it has been since you have seen the girls. Only one time have you not been able to see them due to us canceling plans. All the other times have been out of our control- including you being on vacation, Mom being sick, and the aforementioned appointments that run over. If you and mom really honestly think I’m depriving you of seeing your grandchildren for the sake of being a dickhead, then you don’t and never have known me. Have a good night.” 


You guys. It’s been almost a week with not a peep. Until today of course, when Pity Patty invited us over to their house for dinner tomorrow. 

I don’t want to go, but my DH and I are still talking about it and deciding what we want to do. I know it’s just a “reason” to visit and meet their new dog. I know that since we’ll be under their roof there will be a chance they will try to reprimand us like we’re still children even though I’m 27... I’m closer to being 30 than I am to being a teenager. I think I’ve grown into an adult, but I’m not sure.... (sarcasm is my favorite).

To add even more to it, my Grandparents saw them in church and waved... Pity Patty and FIL ignored them... which happened last year when we had a blow up in June... but that’s for another post. It’s just absolutely petty. 

Even our friends have begun to notice her downward spirals and have told us that she needs meds, meds adjusted and therapy... I mean, what can you say to that? 

Anyways, thanks for reading. I’d love to hear everyone’s take on this. I feel like this was a win but I can’t be too sure."

I spoke to MIL who is claiming she said no such thing and she’s thrilled to be getting two different grandchildren 

And it’s like what?

She’s claiming hubby has been seeing another woman, 27 and he told her that we divorced 5 months ago!!

First the pregnancy dates wouldn’t match?


Husband is claiming she’s lying 

So who do I believe? The woman who husband runs to every conflict or the man who wants me to abort a wanted pregnancy?

I’m so confused and getting nowhere with either of them"
170,"Hello again! Thanks for all the support on the move out post! I really appreciate it. The tips were great too and I’ll be using a lot of them. 

On to the next update!

DH and I talked about when we would meet WaM’s new boyfriend and decided on a day to invite him and WaM to dinner at our house. We love entertaining and cooking so DH and I went in on it like we always do. DH is excellent at smoking meats so he did chicken and ribs, I did sides, and he made an apple pie from scratch (this man can cook and I’ve happily gained like 20 pounds eating his delicious food). 

We purposely set their arrival time close to LO’s bed time so we could control the amount of interaction between them until we could get a better feel for this guy. Also at this dinner were my BIL (DH’s brother) and his wife (SIL) who were staying the night with us after just getting back from their honeymoon before flying back home. 

So WaM and BF get to our house and do the usual “hi how are you, nice to meet you” stuff at the door. I get everyone drinks and talk with BIL and SIL about their honeymoon and let them play with LO who loves them. I get LO ready for lights out after all of that and get him to bed while everyone is starting to sit down and get food. BF starts going in on a story about his EX and how she’s a model or singer or something and how she has photo shoots. He makes a comment about how there’s not enough airbrushing in the world to get out all of her wrinkles. He then keeps going on about how horrible she is (mostly focusing on her looks and something about her being washed up and clinging to her youth). Strike one. We don’t know you and you’re talking about your ex to us like this? I took LO into the other room so I didn’t hear the rest but apparently he went on for quite a while. 

I come back after getting LO down and notice the BF snap his fingers at WaM to get him a new drink right before she sits at the table. I hate finger snapping. I just find it so rude and there’s something just so entitled about it. Then he starts showing us a video on his phone. It’s clearly a comedy but the language was very sexually explicit. I’m not a prude, but everyone was clearly uncomfortable with this guy none of us have ever met before showing us this video. WaM seemed a little embarrassed by it but laughed it off and kept fawning over him. Strike two. 

He then proceeds to get way too drunk (DH takes responsibility for mixing his drinks but at the same time the guy could have cut himself off), and this is not my problem with him actually. I would understand having a few too many at dinner and being nervous to meet your GF’s two sons and their wives. My problem is the following. This guy proceeds to make racist remarks including using the n word. I clearly prickle at this and he tells me he’s not racist but then uses the n word like 3 more times to “prove” it. Tries talking to me in Spanish because he knows I’m Hispanic (spoiler alert, it wasn’t a sentence and he was close to real words but didn’t actually say any real words). He brings up politics and guns. We start playing Cards Against Humanity and he has some off comment about everything (this is mostly BEC but it was for literally everything). He also started getting mad when no one was picking his cards and started pointing to his card saying “pick that one! It’s funny!” 

To top all of this off he starts vaping in our house without asking us first. I looked to DH to say something and he stays quiet. This gets addressed in therapy so I’ll talk about it more in the next post. There’s a reason I didn’t bring it up or confront the guy. 

Through all of this WaM is just smiling and laughing with him like he’s the best thing since sliced bread. She only gets embarrassed about the sexual comments but doesn’t blink an eye at any of the rest. 

We sent them home and DH and I both decided we strongly dislike the guy after that dinner. I don’t want LO around him and I don’t want to be around him. DH is hurt and confused because he was already feeling a little abandoned, but now it’s for a total asshole and that stings. I’m hoping it’s enough to get him out of the FOG as much as it sucks, but her priorities and colors are becoming less subtle. 

Next update will be the most recent event which was our therapy session. I might post that over in justnoso because while WaM is talked about, it’s really more about DH."
171,"TL:DR my mom is pissing me off by being selfish about my venue choice - requires some driving, she wants to get drunk, offered her a sober cab and she declined.

After the debatical with my FJNMIL (ps she's wearing a black dress with purple lace overlay, good job FDH's shiny spine), I am now dealing with my generally JYMom. 

Mom wants me to get married in the town where she lives. Her reasoning is valid; the reception space is attached to a hotel. No worries about anybody driving. But my mom is basically the only person I know in that town. It's a half hour drive from my house, an hour from my FDH's close family. I have no desire to get married there, despite the convenience of drunkenly stumbling next door to my hotel room for the night.

So before she could sway me into a decision I knew I'd regret, I booked my reception venue. It is in FDH's hometown, also a half hour away from where we live. It's also dirt cheap (we're talking $300) and we get extra perks because FDH's family is close with the manager. We can bring our own food, set up the night before, take down the day after. FDH is secretly thrilled with my choice, as this venue is also an hour closer to most of his (much larger than my) family. It's about a ten minute drive to a decent hotel, you can get into a sketchy one about a mile away however.

Naturally, my mom is irritated. Why? Because she can't get toasted at my wedding. We had [a ridiculous text exchange](http://imgur.com/gallery/zH9g7pi) the other night. Offered her a sober cab and she declined. My mom has a long history of being self-centered (stories for another day), and she's been married 4 times. Meanwhile, I only plan on doing this once and I want to do what feels right for FDH and myself. 

I should probably add that my mom bought my $700 dress and I told her about my venue decision while we were in the bridal store. I was not in any way expecting her to pay, and walked into the situation prepared to spend up to my $1k budget.

Sorry this got so long, but I am so mad at her. Am I overreacting?

Edit: pic link with FDH's name blacked out."
172,"I posted a few days ago about my DH being pressured to make a stressful Christmas trip to visit his family. I'm marking this as a Success because DH made (what I feel is the best) decision. We read everyone's advice, which was overwhelmingly in the ""don't go"" camp, and I think really helped him see that he wasn't being unreasonable for not wanting to put himself in such a bad situation.

Yesterday, DH's brother called to chat, and of course he asked about Christmas. DH hesitated, but then told him firmly that he's not going (Success!), citing how triggering every single part of that trip would be for his PTSD. His brother, true to the rest of the clan, was approximately 0% understanding. Of course.

DH also called his dad to break the news, and at least he was just disappointed but not angry. I think he saw it coming. FIL said he'd break the news to MIL, and as far as I know DH hasn't heard from her yet. I'm sure a meltdown is imminent, though.

So now, DH is going to try to get a refund or a credit on his plane ticket (does anyone know the likelihood of that, btw?), and we're going to try to plan a visit together to their neck of the woods at a later date, at a time not coinciding with anyone's birthday or any holiday whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone for your advice and support! It really does mean a lot. &lt;3"
173,"This is an OLD story...might be older than people reading it.... 

Before DH &amp; I got married we had the traditional bachelor/bachelorette type parties. Dh’s was an entire weekend away where I knew they’d be going to a strip club. I was fine with that but asked that he turn down any lap dances...that’s my line. Look but don’t touch. Welp, his uncles bought him a lap dance. He was honest with me about it. I was upset but it was nothing to call the wedding off over.  He apologized and said he didn’t know how to tell his uncles no. Blah blah blah. 

Fast forward to my bachelorette two weeks later. My wedding party had heard how upset I was about the lap dance so they all pitched in behind my back to get a stripper ‘to make it even’ between DH &amp; I. We started off at one of my bridesmaids house with all family too, so my mom, JNMIL, aunts, cousins, everyone. The plan was dinner with everyone and then drinks and dancing where the parents/aunts would skip. The stripper showed up at my bridesmaids house where we all met before dinner. So 30 women &amp; this greased up &amp; not cute stripper. I was not happy about the surprise and spent the show with my hands over my eyes. I tried to be a good sport but it was just gross. This guy was covered in oil/something that made him shiny and he grabbed my hand at one point to run down his belly &amp; chest &amp; it was stubbly...like he shaved his chest the day before. And now my hand was greasy. 

So JNMIL is enjoying every minute of it, and trying to do a ‘see! It’s not so bad! You can’t be mad at my baby boy for the lap dance!’ She’s touching the stripper &amp; dancing with him. She’s encouraging him to give me a lap dance, etc. and then...the highlight of her night!!! He offers his greasy nasty belly button for shots! JNMIL is first in line!!! He lays down on a table, pours some rum down his chest &amp; JNmil sucks it out of his bellybutton where it pooled. I wanted to vomit. No one else did a shot. 

So....who else had a JN doing shots out of strippers belly buttons?!? Just me??"
174,"my FMIL Peek-A-Boob (PAB) is in my firm opinion a narcissist. The most annoying part is that every time I turn around she is trying to convince my SO to go do something with her and Step-father completely disregarding our time. ""come to England"" ""come to Spain"" ""come watch sports for 3 hours, don't worry about the project AwkwardStick is trying to get you do."" ""join us in Hawaii"" ""don't do this unless JYFFIL can come do it with you""

she is a manipulative controlling woman and I'm having a hell of a hard time trying to pull SO out of the FOG and get him to set boundaries with me. 

ideas are more than welcome."
175,"LTL;FTP. If I could add multiple flares I’d choose Am I Overreacting and Give it to Me Straight. I honestly just need feedback from people outside of my family and social circle. This is so long and I apologize- I swear I've deleted whole paragraphs trying to shorten it. 

Background: D(ear)H and I are in our 30’s. We’ve been together about 3.5 years and married for 3 of them (because when you know, you know). We are proud parents to an 11 week old DS. I’m American by birth and DH immigrated here as an adolescent. MIL is his only family living in this country. The cultural and language barrier between me and MIL is very real, and it’s sometimes hard to sort out what’s owed to those vs. what’s poor behavior. 

What’s going on: There is a history for our entire relationship of MIL being overbearing, stomping small boundaries, and disrespecting me in small ways. Examples include bringing an extra cake to my wedding (I’d agreed to let her bring a non-cake dessert favored in her culture. She brought that AND a whole other cake), constantly criticizing my inability to speak her native language conversationally (including in public during social events) and providing me with educational materials I didn’t ask for, pitching a fit when DH ended toxic relationships with old “friends” who have nothing to do with her anyway, insisting we invite people we don’t know to our important events (she brought people I’ve never met to my baby shower), coming around us when she is sick (including during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of my pregnancy), always bringing additional food to elaborately planned meals, having a shocking lack of empathy (like telling me to get over a miscarriage), etc. etc.  

During my pregnancy I started to be really nervous that things were about to get a whole lot worse and sure enough they did! At Mother’s Day, MIL gifted my husband a mug that said World’s Best Dad (or something). Cheesy, I know, but I was so upset! First of all, it’s inappropriate as hell to gift him anything on Mother’s Day. Second, I feel it’s not her place to give him father-specific gifts. I was upset that the first thing my husband owned that said “Daddy” came from his mom. I’d had a gift “from DS” already purchased and waiting to give him on Father’s Day. I asked DH to put the mug where I’d never see it and talk to his mom about respecting our “firsts” and knowing her role (he did both of those things, btw, and it resulted in tears from MIL). 

Next up, we invited all of the grands to a 4D ultrasound. At the ultrasound venue MIL immediately checked in on bookface, so we asked her not to make any more posts about the event. She then insisted we take a photo, and immediately posted it to bookface. She claimed she misunderstood. After the scan she got put out that we declined to have lunch with her due to a new gestational diabetes diagnosis. I was still figuring out my diet. We had to stress to her that the diagnosis was serious so she didn't take it personally. We made a point to remind her not to share information about my new diagnosis with anyone, so instead she sent an embarrassing and cryptic message to her family chat asking all of her family members to attend church, pray for my safety, and make monetary donations in my name. At my insistence, DH had a follow-up conversation with her about our expectations for keeping our information private, including from family, and especially in regards to the upcoming labor/birth. 

MIL took a long trip to her country of origin after that and did not return until my pregnancy was nearly over. We didn’t know it at the time because baby was early, but we were all together at a CPR class only days before DS was born. MIL told us after the class, and after DH had dinner with her the next day, that she was sick. We were furious to find out she exposed us to illness TWICE and discussed that she wouldn’t be allowed to visit baby until she was well. As she has a history of coming around sick, it would need to be directly addressed as well.  After 30 hours of labor and an inevitable C-section, we let her know that DS was born but didn't say much else as we spent hours in recovery before being brought to a room. DS ended up spending 2 hours in the NICU, and my parents came up to check on me (but did not get to meet DS). It's honestly all a blur, but at some point MIL texted me asking me to send a pic of DS to her mother.  I replied that I'd ask DH about it.  Then, I re-read her message and realized she'd asked me to send a picture specifically because her mother was anxious to see DS.  How would her mother even know he was born? I popped into the family chat and sure enough- a message from her to everyone announcing, ""I am a grandmom!"" Poor DH was infuriated and so upset that she stole his announcement. Apparently his mother had also asked him to send pictures to her family, but he had ignored the text with everything that was happening. Instead of waiting for his reply, she announced on her own and then tried to get me to send pics instead.  She then tried to guilt DH by telling him he was causing harm to his elderly grandma due to the anxiety she was having. He messaged MIL telling her he was upset, and asking for space.  Over the next several days, I was having increasing pain in my incision and not doing very well. MIL would not stop messaging both of us, so I reiterated (lovingly) our need for some space and asked her to stop messaging until we reached out to her. She. Went. Off. She sent a long message all about how she had done nothing wrong but share her joy with her mother (and the other 9 or so people in the chat??).  She capitalized every instance of DH's name and ""MY FAMILY"" and it really felt as if she were making a point to make me feel like an outsider. She claimed to misunderstand my husband's instructions about keeping things private (obviously her go-to excuse). I told her that she was being dishonest with herself and needed to have a good conversation with DH when he was ready, and that she and I were not going to speak again until she could respect me as a DIL and human being.  I blocked her.  I absolutely could not deal with the additional stress she was causing in that moment. 

I was discharged after 5 days, but not home for 48 hours when I was re-admitted because my incision burst.  I had a severe infection and required additional surgery and a lengthy hospital stay.  DH and I relied on our close family and friends to get us through a dangerous and trying time, and it was really hurtful that we couldn't count MIL amongst those people.  After being discharged again, I required in-home nursing care and special wound treatment. . . becoming a new mom was nothing like I'd expected.  I tolerated two short visits from MIL because I thought she should meet DS, but kept her blocked and didn't engage much.  DH was LC as well by his own choice.  MIL did send a generic apology to him, but it did not show any understanding of why our feelings were so hurt. MIL started leaving food on our doorstep, and twice she ambushed us in public at times she knew where we were. 

As weeks have passed, and as we are anticipating DH's uncle coming to town from overseas, I thought it would be best to clear the air with MIL. We went to her house for breakfast and I tried as best as I could to express myself non-confrontationally. I said I just wanted her to understand why I reacted so strongly to everything that happened.  I honestly believed that if she knew how her actions were perceived she might do things differently.  No one wants their own kid to be unable to trust and rely on them in a moment of crisis, right? Well, she totally flipped the script on me and made herself into the victim.  Suddenly, we'd ""accused"" her of being sick when she wasn't, then we, ""excluded"" her from everything and continued to ""punish"" her when she had only done one thing wrong, due to a miscommunication, and was powerless to change it. Of course I countered her narrative, and provided examples of additional behaviors when she demanded. . . so she stopped yelling and started crying that if we don't like her she can sell all of her things and move back to her country of origin.  Before I knew it, I was comforting her and we were ending the conversation. I didn't even get to be heard or understood in the slightest.  Also notable in our visit:  she gifted us with ""first Halloween"" outfit for DS (rejected kindly by DH), and twice refused to hand my son back to me when he started fussing (instead shifting him and attempting to comfort him herself). She also kissed him on his feet despite our no kissing rule, of which she is obviously aware (also confronted by DH in the moment). Oh, and she repeatedly asked us about bringing food to DS's baptism (legit asked if she should get that same cake she brought to the wedding), finally insisting we take a check when we declined food contributions because we prefer to have it catered and the godmother is making amazing desserts.  We have no idea what strings come attached to this money (like extra guests at our very intimate gathering).  DH already knows not to cash the check and he will discuss with MIL. 

I am just at a loss. These same problems are obviously going to come up again and again and with potentially worse consequences than ruined announcements. I am back and forth between feeling justified in all I've said and done, and feeling like a total asshole.  My friends are telling me to get over it and learn to live in relative peace for DH's sake.  DH is unhappy, but very supportive of my position. Am I right to say she can't be a part of DS's care plan?  Am I right to even be offended about some stupid mug and pumpkin booties?  Is it unfair that I asked for my son back when he whined?  Truth be told, I probably wouldn't have if it were my mom holding him. I just don't know how to proceed here."
176,"I'm a 24F mom to a 10 mb. I had to move back due to problems with baby's father. I thought everything was going well until I decided to get an apartment.  My NM threw a fit.  She said she was worried about me financially.  So, I decided not to go through with it. A few months go by, and I get home from work ( I work 9 hours). My NM watches my baby while I'm at work. She would get upset if I came home later than usual but the reason why is because 1.) It takes me 35 minutes to get to my town after work 2.) I pick 16YF up from school 3.) Get her food. . . NM gets PISSED and assumes I just goof off after work. Last Friday, NM asked me to come home from work and take care of my 10M because she was having anxiety. I can't do that ( financially!) I decided to sign my 10M up for daycare Tuesdays and Thursdays to give her a break.  She threw a fit.  And it escalated into her saying "" you're not as mature as you think you are.  You are just doing this because it's convenient for you."" She said "" I'm going to call your MIL( i have sole physical custody of 10M and tell her everything and go on her side)"" I said "" please do! Because there's nothing I've done wrong."" Then, she calls me a B***H about 5 times. She then THREATENED to kill herself with a gun( not the first time) . Last night, my dad told me ""NM is watching the baby tomorrow because he'll be home."" I said "" no."" And then he talked to NM. NM threw another fit and said "" it's all her fault. It's all her fault. Everyone is against me."" 
I want out of the house.  Financially I can't do it. But this is TOXIC for my 10M. Do I move back with 10M father? We've had a rough year but things are calmer.  I have sole physical custody of 10M but that's because MIL became too attached to my baby. I've set the boundaries.  Do I just let 10M live with his father and I not go? I don't want him here at my NM house."
177,"I post here almost 2 months ago-the just feeling betrayed thread.  I just wanted to let you guys know it’s going well-we have hard boundaries in place-jnmil eloped and got married, and we haven’t heard much from her since.  She’s being kinder to the kids because her new husband loves the kids, and I have minimal-if any- contact.  My husband is handling things brilliantly and I’m just so....proud?  Totally in love with him?....thinking he’s supportive and amazing?   

I’m certain she’s still saying nasty things-but I’m emotionally indifferent to her opinion, so she’s not hurting me at all.  It’s really nice.  Thank you all so much for listening.  My husband helped me go through all the stuff she said I stole-we kept what he wanted and donated and burned the rest.  I thought of you all the entire time.  Should have taken a picture for you!  

Thanks again for listening!!"
178,"I have posted in this group to vent, but not for a while. 

So my MIL is the spawn of Satan, interferes, bullies, offends, ALWAYS knows best, is NEVER wrong and is a straight up fucking nightmare.

I was NC with my MIL for nearly 3 years (and they were amazing not having to deal with her)! When my son came along she caused extreme problems in my relationship with her son, demanded he take our baby away from me at 2 days old (he was also jaundice) to go take him to see her because she didn’t want to see me. After 2 weeks of arguments (we rarely even bicker, this was extreme) I gave in and said she could come to us but my mum would be there too. For my partner I agreed she could be in our sons life but she had to prove herself after the years of being her scapegoat I wasn’t welcoming her with open arms.

Fast forward nearly 2 years and she’s not seen our son even 10x, we are expected to go to her EVERY Sunday because she’s the ‘head’ of the family and she calls the shots... I think not. Anyway 3 weeks ago my OH leant me his phone as my battery had died, whilst messaging my friend curiosity got the better of me about what she’s been saying now (often emotionally manipulates him/ guilt trips him which he refuses to tell me about as already knows my answer). 

The messages included 20 properties for sale in the village she lives, some over the road. One of which she’d put “you need to let me know ASAP if you want to buy this. It’s so and so’s sisters house and I’ve rang her to let her know you’re interested and she’s agreed to let you have it for a reduced rate... WTF!!! We are looking to buy a bigger house but we’d never move to her area as she’d be spying and constantly causing problems, we wouldn’t live there if it was the last place on Earth. She started going crazy with my OH about not buying houses she’s found for him to buy and started to try guilt trip him saying the area we’re looking to buy in isn’t a place to bring up a child (a child she doesn’t even bother with). Constantly tries to drill into us the school that’s nearest to her is the best in the city where we live (far from it, I have friends who have pulled their kids out of the school as we’re severely bullied).

This brings me onto the next point. We’ve decided to send our son when he’s old enough to private school, we’re in a position where we can afford to do it and believe it will give him a great start in life. MIL is constantly badgering my OH that it’s “an idiotic idea” he won’t mix there, none of his school friends would want to come to his home and somehow thinks it’s her decision to make.

My partner doesn’t know I’ve seen these messages as she hasn’t influenced his decision so I feel there’s 0 point bringing them up to him.

I’ve spoken to my therapist I depth about her, I’ve learnt techniques to shut down her bullshit and I truly believe now that if my anxiety doesn’t get the better of me I’m ready to set boundaries and inform her we will live our life the way we choose to.

It’s my sons 2nd birthday on Friday, she’ll no doubt turn up a week later when he’s asleep and I sure as hell know the houses or school is going to get brought up. My partner can’t see it yet or is massively in denial, but I’m to the point now I don’t want my son around such poison. If she can bad mouth me to her son and call me all the names under the son she won’t be bothered about starting a smear campaign to my own son. How do I get OH on board? I’ve been too scared of this women to ever stick up for myself, but something has got to give or I’m going to end up letting her demean and belittle me for the rest of my life."
179,"I had a baby two months ago, and this is the first grandchild on both sides of the family. My own mom lives 2 hours away, so it’s not that easy for her to visit and my dad passed away 4 years ago, but my in laws live 15 minutes away. I feel like they hardly come to see their grandson, even though my husband and I have said soooo many times that they are welcome to come, they are not bothering us, and we would never keep them from their grandbaby. Still, they never offer to help out, and they never take any initiative to get together. They are very hands off and think that it’s enough to buy presents or food. Like dude, we can afford to pay for that stuff ourselves, but you can’t but time spent with family.  I honestly expected more from them since they’re constantly gushing on social media about how excited they are, how much they love him, blah blah blah. But like, hello, you never come to see him unless we ask you to? What is this?! 
Ok now on the other hand, I feel like my mother in law is suuuper fake, and I have to walk on eggshells around her because she is so sensitive and thinks the world is out to get her. Even though I don’t love spending time with her (because I don’t love having to fake being in an excellent mood otherwise she will ask me why I’m sad), I still want my son to have a relationship with his grandmother. I just find it so bizarre that they seem so unwilling to come over to see him in person. She watches all my Facebook stories but never comments, so I stopped posting on there because if she wants to see him, she can come over here as it’s not that far. They only come when we invite them, and expect to be treated like guests. Like hello, I just had a baby and I have to serve you water and put away your dishes? Ffs. 
So anyway, should I just accept the situation as it is and pretend they live super far away so it doesn’t bother me so much? Should I confront her about how she should come over to see him and help out more? I’m afraid of making a mess out of things. My husband has talked to his parents multiple times about this, and I have made it clear that they are welcome, but at this point it’s like - if they really wanted to come, they would. So idk, any thoughts or suggestions? Anyone experience anything similar?"
180,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 28F living abroad with my wife, and I'm dealing with my mom.
To cut the story short. I've set major boundaries this last year with my mom. She hasn't been over to see me in a whole year (She would come and stay with us three months at a time when she had control)

When I first moved abroad I had a car service drive us around to get familiar with the area (I didn't drive because my mom made me feel like I can't for a long time) We befriend (myself, wife and mom) a driver we used, and we would use him at least once a week or more. I noticed he would inappropriately look at me. I brushed it off because my mom said ""That's just how he is, it's not the way it looks"" But of course over time he made a comment towards me and still my mother said ""Don't think he meant it that way"" and continued to want to use him. The last straw was a disgusting comment he made to me privately that made me feel so sick, and I knew then that I didn't imagine shit, and it was very well what I thought and felt. From that moment I said ""Enough"" I, of course, told my wife and mother. My wife was furious, and my mother pretended to act upset.

Fast forward a year and a half later but mother texted me yesterday to say ""Oh, by the way, I spoke to the driver... he apologised to ME"" I replied and said ""What, for being a disgusting pig?"" she said ""lol I asked him where it's coming from and he replied and told me he was held at gunpoint and nearly died"" I said ""Well It's great he is safe but it doesn't excuse what he said to me"" She said ""Yeah he said he apologized to you guys as well"" I know she's probably lying because she is coming to visit for Christmas (staying at a hotel) and obviously wants to use him for his services and most likely has reached out.

I just think like he made numerous passes at me which she then made me feel like I was imagining it and even then I felt like I couldn't be vocal about it because I was made to feel so uncomfortable and once again you're going to disrespect your daughter and her wife just so you can get a discount and ride with a perv?? Am I overreacting?

She also, as I said, is coming for Christmas. I said I wasn't sure If I wanted her to come and now she is staying at a hotel. Does anyone else's mother go above and beyond for men in general?"
181,"I’ll try to keep this from being a total wall of text, but no promises, since I need to vent to someone other than my mother or my work mom. 

I met my BF a year and a half ago. Perfect fit, horrible timing. But we’ve been making it work as best as we can, given the circumstances. Without going into the gruesome details, he left an abusive marriage, moved across country, and in with his family, all in a matter of a few weeks. Sounds okay, right?

Wrong. So he’s from a culture where verbally abusing your adult children is okay. They’re also Jehovah’s Witnesses. I’m really open minded, and I work in an industry where I help people from all races, ethnicities, and religious backgrounds. I have little patience for bigotry and hatefulness. 

Since going public with our relationship (~3 months in), his family has had a weird obsession with me. His sister tried to be my new best friend, and for a minute it was awesome. Until she tried to talk down to me (bitchsplain? Like mansplaining but from a woman) about his medical condition. As a former medical professional, and having suffered my own TBI, I don’t need someone to talk to me like I’m 5 and be rude. I asked her to lower her tone, and remember I’ve dealt with TBIs professionally and personally. She lost it. Hung up and has spoken to me once since then. 

His parents are just as bad. I all but walked on water in their eyes, even though I’m a “worldly” person (I’m not a JW, he isn’t either). He asked for help, and I made a call. Well, that 43 second phone call blew his parents away. They accused me of overstepping boundaries, and it opened the flood gates to a lot of horrible things. They’ve called me fat (I am very fluffy, but I’ve been keto for a long time and I’m not nearly as fat as I used to be), they’ve called me a whore (because he’s still legally married, even though it’s been in the courts for two years, said my mother is untrustworthy (she’s no saint, but she’s got your back), and a lot of other passive aggressive moves to be assholes. 

To the point. Brain injury, I go on a lot of tangents. I also have PMDD and this is hell week for sure. 

They’ve gone on an 8 week trip, and tried to force him to go for all 8 weeks. He said no, he’d go for 2. They’ve been gone since Friday, and they’ve thwarted every call he’s made to me. ALL OF THEM. We’re not set to move in together until January (my terms, divorce has to be final before I shack up with him), so he still lives with them. Again, the culture difference comes in. My family respects me, my decisions, and my relationships. His family does none of the above. My brother is a disgusting POS, but he’s got charisma and we have to see each other at family things. He’s got  swastika, white power, and confederate flag tattoos, but happily accepted my BF into the family and they actually get along better than I do with him. His family hates me because I’m fat. 

It’s a little funny. 

I’m frustrated because he hasn’t found his shiny spine yet. He defends me all the time, but sometimes he just lies down and let’s them run all over the place. 

I love this man. I knew I loved him the moment I met him. I know he’s worth it, but his family needs to call the fuck down because I seriously can’t stand it. They don’t know we’ve found an apartment. They don’t know he’s planning on moving out of state with me in a year or so. Their heads are going to spin. 

Hopefully this mess makes sense. I’m so mentally scrambled with my issues, plus his issues that I can’t think straight. 

Anyways, thanks for letting me rant. Maybe with the foundation down, if I post again, it’ll make more sense."
182,"This is just a question for my situation. My JNMIL played dumb and “misread” our messages stating that we want to buy our kids their “firsts”. 🙄🤦‍♀️

How do you deal with the JN’s playing dumb? 
What do you say?"
183,"So in order to understand this I have to give you some backstory: my mom and dad are divorced I love my dad more than anything in world but I live with my mom and they got divorced when I was really young so I didn't get a choice also it was the best decision for me and my siblings. 
Now for today's topic my mom cheated on my dad ( when they were still married he doesn't know) and my stepdad (whom I absolutely hate but can't act like it he also doesn't know and I don't plan on telling him) and that makes me extremely upset. My mom even tho she is completely capable of doing things on her own is making me and my older sister do ALL of the chores including cleaning her room and all of the rooms in our house including my little brother who is also completely and totally capable of doing things UGH. Also I was away this past week staying with my friend for fall break and she called me MID WEEK and keep in mind I had called her TWICE A DAY EVERYDAY I HAD BEEN GONE and she says that I'm NOT KEEPING IN CONTACT ENOUGH!!!!! What should I do about my  overbearing mother? That is making my anxiety so much worse. Also lately she's been so toxic I don't even want to be around her I'm scared of her. My depression is worsening and she's doing it making it worse. I think she doing it on purpose. She's been gaslighting me so much lately and idk what's real and what's not anymore."
184,"So this is not a post about my JNFMIL (right now she’s out of the country and my SO and I are long distance so my exposure is very limited, so great for my peace of mind) but about my own JustNoGrandmother. 

For as long as I’ve been alive, I have hated that woman. She and my grandfather are wealthy, prominent members of their church community, and growing up my whole life was about appearances. I was a little crown princess meant to carry on the family legacy, and a toe out of line would lead to screaming and insults directed at my father, her oldest and GC, which he would then take out on me, his scapegoat. My dad doesn’t have a personality disorder, but oh boy, does he ever have an awful case of FLEAs. My memories of her are not of being hugged and praised and spoiled, but of having my shoulders forced back by her bony hands, my chin pushed up, and my pelvis yanked forward while she yelled in my ear “Stand up straight!” instead of telling me hello upon seeing me. She expected proper behavior, adoration, and absolute obedience from me at all times, and that was something I was just not willing to give, to her or her son. I won’t lie. I was a precocious, angry, defensive, short fused, defiant little shit because of the two of them, it’s what I needed to do to survive. You don’t even want to know about the fit she threw when I told her I didn’t believe in god and didn’t want to go to Sunday school anymore when I was 9. I’m frankly surprised I left that house without a beating, in hindsight. 

Anyway, onto the story at hand. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 3 years now, in another two we want to be formally engaged, and in another two after that, married. We’ve already had a lot of the premarital conversations about boundaries and responsibilities and values, and the plan is to keep talking to have the healthiest partnership possible while dealing with our respective JustNos and respective FLEAs. I was driving around with my mom today, and we passed a wedding boutique with a disgustingly poofy dress in the window. We made a joke about it and the subject came to her wedding, which she doesn’t often talk about. Al I’d ever known was that it was a big to-do, wedding of the year type thing. I’d never really known why the silence until today, but now I see how much sense it makes. 

Nearly 30 years ago in 1992-3, my parents (who are still married) were planning their wedding. My dad was an up and coming lawyer in Los Angeles, and my mom worked as a restorative artist. The original plan for their wedding was to rent a rooftop club in downtown and have an intimate ceremony with less than 100 people. “A big, happy cocktail party” my mom put it. She said the venue was elegant, they would have wonderful food, great music, a laid back atmosphere and everyone would have a great time. Sounds ideal right? Not to my grandmother. My parents went to a relative’s house to tell the family their wedding plans. My grandmother had the absolute king of all conniption fits. My mother told me that she sat in the corner of the room, paralyzed and in tears, while my grandmother tore her and my dad a new one about their plans, saying it wasn’t fitting of someone of his status, it would embarrass the family, it wasn’t proper, and “you need speeches and order and a program!! How are you going to have a program if there’s no sit down dinner!” She then lost her shit about it not being a church wedding, how the guest list was improper, everything was wrong, wrong, wrong. My mom said that she wanted to leave and never return. My dad, at his wit’s end, said “okay, if that’s what you want, you need to pay for it.” Then he got up and left. The very next day, she handed him a check for $10k which covered over half of the wedding costs. So my mother had a cathedral wedding, with over 300 people, and it was nothing like what she wanted. My grandmother won that one, and many more. The next 30 years have been the same story, with my dad bending over backwards for his mother, and my mother giving in out of “fear, obligation, guilt.” She’s admitted to me now that she didn’t do enough to protect me from either of them, but as an adult, I have grown a serious hatred for the word “obligation” and everything tied to it. 

So how does this pertain to me? It’s simple. My grandparents are in their nineties now. They have a massive estate, a portion of which I’m entitled to through my trust. I’d already decided that I wanted to use part of my trust to pay for my wedding, since other parts of the estate are paying for my education and other needs. Hearing this story though, it lit a fire under my ass. I am determined to use that trust, their money, to have a wedding that my grandmother would’ve absolutely hated. I’m talking on a farm, with a completely secular service, a sheath dress fitted to every last curve on my body, and barbecue served at the reception to oldies music playing in the background. And no one is going to stop me, obligation be damned. Did I mention that my partner is also 100% indigenous South American and while he is a delightful human being, he couldn’t be any further from the stuffy pricks I had to grow up with who are probably more “suitable” matches for me in her eyes? Oh, I get a shiver of fiendish delight being a visible interracial couple at my all white upper class family events. It’s better than any drug, let me tell you. 

She’ll be dead by the time I get married (at least I hope she’ll be dead, but with my luck she’ll outlive my children out of sheer orneriness) and maybe I’ll visit her grave after it’s all done and said and tell her what I’ve done. I’ll try and resist the urge to spit, but no promises. Sometimes I shock myself with the amount of sheer spite I feel towards her, but then I remember every last little thing she’s done to deserve it. I’m not sorry. Not for any of it.

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the love and support! I’m truly overwhelmed. A little note, this is the wedding I would’ve wanted anyway, I’m not deliberately picking things just to spite the witch. That’s only a small part. I’m getting married at a place that’s near and dear to me, in a dress style that makes me feel like a million bucks, with my favorite food and favorite music going all night long. This is always what I dreamed of for myself and for my love, the fact that she would’ve hated it just makes it extra sweet. The spite component might cause me to throw in a few extra elements (TBD) but it’s for sure not dictating everything I do. Thank you all again, so much love to each and every one of you."
185,"Tldr: we moved into mijocastas unused apartment and now she wont leave us alone while also disrespecting our 7 year relationship.

I am a fucking fool, a fuck off idiot that just ruined a whole month of my life and maybe a bit more, 
So it started at the end of September, mijocasta had been trying to get us to take her apartment, she swore the place would be just us and BIL(mistake 1). She fucking lied, she has come over every week for 1-3 days at a time which honestly would not be bad if she wasnt a narcissist. Mijocasta ""cares"" she calls everyday to check in and she threatens to show up at my mother's house to see Hub, I thought she was just a fucking clingy mom, but no its worse she wants to break hubs spirit and also break us up so that she can have control over him and BIL. Bil is a new cop so is his girlfriend, a domestic would ruin both of their careers. And yet she has the audacity to tell Hub that our relationship is garbage because hes ""changed"" he doesnt let her choose his life so hes wrong and mentally Ill. Yesterday was the first time in 5 years that I have heard him yell, I had to drag him away from her because she kept disrespecting me to him and he is very protective of me. I just got a new job we need to get out of here fast because she just keeps getting worse, I'm rambling and my words aren't perfectly clear but all 4 of us (me, hubs, bil, and bilgf) are trying to find a new apartment and get out of here before november.

Plus...shes very anti weed and hubs smokes and she would actually call the cops on her son just to get to him so I'm taking our paraphernalia out of the house so that if she comes while we are working and tries to go through our stuff she wont find them.
Help...we need to get out we are desperate and contemplating a fucking loan just to get the hell out of here. I wish i had the clarity to like explain why she is the worst but I'm seriously wired and losing my fucking mind"

FTP, on mobile. Throwaway.

Been with my SO for 5 years and we have a 3yr old LO. FMIL has always had some boundary issues IMO, most especially infantilizing my SO. SO is still very much in the fog and even when it clears a little, has a very noodley spine. You may find me over on JNSO in the near future. FFIL has had a few JN moments but is usually just quiet and therefore enabling. 

Anyways, problem at hand:
Background- SOs parents watch LO for us for work. We both work very non-daycare friendly hours and my family is a few hours away in another state. Frequency for using them as childcare can vary widely from month to month. And many times, they take LO for overnights to facilitate an optimal schedule for LO. 
Also, SO did have one conversation regarding some boundaries I wanted set about a year ago, but I wasn’t there so not sure how firm he was 🙄

Edit: remove specific details that may make situation identifiable due to my paranoia. Basically they did something with LO they should have asked us about before doing. 

I haven’t really been able to discuss SO’s feelings on the matter because we’ve barely seen each other but it’s basically being rugswept into the world of, “what do you want me to do about it now?” With that irritating helpless tone. Eye rolls aplenty.  (I screamed (I know, not productive) “YOU NEED TO SET SOME FUCKING BOUNDARIES!”) 
Usually his excuse is a JN favorite, “that’s just how she is.” And he almost always thinks I’m over reacting. Maybe I am???? though the few friends I’ve shared some of her antics with didn’t think so. 🤷🏻‍♀️

For the most part, I’m fairy LC with them. A lot of what she does is BEC so I try to keep that in check but I’m human. Some of it is just personality differences. I see them at family functions, and pick-up/drop-off of LO as needed. we definitely have them on an info diet and i grey rock, SO does sometimes. I flat out ignore some of her texts sometimes when she’s being annoying. SO and I are pursuing couples therapy for communication issues. 

Advice needed: I will and have stood up to her myself but I err on the side of, “handle our own circuses.” I want to draft a text/email to be sent from SO to his mother highlighting this issue - 

Edit: removed some information due to paranoia about specific details that may make this situation identifiable.

She is not a narc imo but she will absolutely get very defensive and very emotional over being reprimanded. She’s clearly going to know that I came home and tattled to SO, and that the feelings are likely mine. 

Sorry for the length and rambling. 

Before it gets suggested, NC is not an option, and a TO isn’t really an option. For the time being, they are our childcare, though I have moved schedules around as much as possible the past few months to limit how much we need to use them. And they are sort of on a TO in that they only get LO now when we need childcare- no extra visits. They don’t actually know this but I laid down that boundary with SO because I need a break from them and I think LO needs some space from them. In general, I do trust that LO is safe in their care, and that the pony was docile, but regardless, they crossed a line."
187,"Wife and I have dated since she was 13 and I was 15, I’m now 49 years of age.

I have two MILS, they’re not married
There’s MIL1 who is wife’s adoptive mother and MIL2 who is the bio one.

Wife has always been desperate to have MIL2 involved in her life.

MIL2 has known wife for two weeks, in this time she has looked into moving  closer despite having a 23 year  old son somewhere else.

MIL2 is constantly taking wife out to get drunk.

She’s also now insisting we kick our 9 year old out of his room so she can sleep in there for a week

I absolutely detest this woman"
188,"The bot can update you, but essentially I let me MIL know that I needed space from her 2 weeks ago due to her shit talking me to my DH. DH reiterated my points and need for space a few days ago on the phone. She said she got it. Today is DH and I’s 2nd wedding anniversary (yay!) and she sent us a massive bouquet of flowers, in addition to texting me “happy anniversary”. This is not what space looks like to me. The gift giving in particular has always been an issue, where she’ll be shitty and then give me big expensive gifts. I was raised to say thank you when someone gives me a gift, but I really don’t feel thankful for gifts that try to manipulate my boundaries. DH is pissed enough at her about this, that I don’t feel the need to take on anger about it. I’m just heavily annoyed. We don’t really know how to respond. I told him to just ignore her today, as it’s our anniversary and I don’t want it to be about her. 

We both have our individual AND couples therapy scheduled this week, so I feel like we’ll be able to get some insight from objective professionals. But I figured I could use any advice you all have to offer. Pretend that she’s a bad dog, and ignore her bad behavior? Should he say something to her, or do you think that would make it worse?"
189,"I’m so done with jnmils constant manipulation and lies and these games. I don’t want to see her like at all but I try to be nice and see her every few months. But of course it’s never enough. 
She does this thing that’s kind of just sad where everything she buys for LOs has to say something grandma on it or she’ll write grandma on it. Like a shirt that says I want grandma or if it’s a coloring book shell write in it from your grandma. Okay lady we get it but no one will remember or care (or wear) about these things. 
A little while ago when I hadn’t spoken to her in a week (yes just a week) she sent LOs a fruit/cheese basket that said I miss you. Yup neither can read or have much of it and she sent that. It’s was obviously for me to feel guilty because I’m so mean and grandma just is so sad. Can she ever be normal?"
190,"So me and my husband recently moved out of his parents home because we finally found somewhere we can afford. The day we moved out MIL asked DH what day we want to come round for weekly family dinner, and he let her know that we weren’t going to come over that often unless she stopped smoking in the house (I have severe asthma and living there made it the worst it had ever been, I also have anxiety and hate being around smoke because it’s a trigger and I worry about health risks) she then started yelling about how I hate her, it’s just an excuse and I made DH hate her. I wasn’t there so can’t give exact quotes.

I have tried to call her and text her to explain myself but she won’t pick up and I don’t think she reads my texts because of how quick she replies (English is not her first language and she’s a slow reader) 
I have agreed to go once every two weeks, mostly so I can explain myself in person. I don’t want to go but I also want to keep my previously ok relationship with her. I don’t agree with her about about of things, and she has done some things that make me angry and frustrated but she’s still my husbands mother and he loves her so I try to get along.

Am I overreacting about the smoking? I’m not sure what else I can say to her that I haven’t already said."

192,"Background: Been NC with my JNMom for about a year and a half since she freaked out on my DH and me whilst we were down taking care of her post surgery. What did we do wrong? My DH of 18 years made fun of my ex prom date's photo.  (which, IMHO, shouldn't have been displayed so prominently anyway!).

Yesterday: My JYGma was having a surprise 96th birthday party. My son told me that JNMom had to work. Since it was my dad's mom, I figured it would be fine. My DH stayed home just to be safe as he didn't want to cause a scene in case JNM WAS there (spoiler alert: she was there).

I sat between my eDad and son. I ignored JNM as much as possible without being out and out rude. She was wearing a shirt that was WAY too low cut for a woman her age (60s) and kept making a point of asking everyone for a safety pin. I guess stopping at the Walmart they passed when they drove in was too inconvenient.

My eDad and I happened to go to the bathroom at the same time. We had this conversation: 

D: ""Mom seems to think that you are mad at her.""

Me: ""I'm not the one who threatened to call the cops if I didn't get out of her house!""

D: ""Well, she meant that more to your husband than you.""

Me: ""It was me she screamed it at. Plus, what if I told you to come to my place for Thanksgiving but don't bring mom with?""

He didn't have a real response for that one. Fine. I knew that she would spin the story her way and I have never once told eDad my side of the story (still haven't completely for that matter).

Later on, my son, his GF and I decided to leave. My son hugged my mom, dad and grandma. JNM came over and gave me a huge hug. I could kick myself for not reacting more but I let it happen. I then hugged my eDad and grandma and we left. I wished she would have just gone to work. I obviously was not prepared for the situation."
193,"Started a new profile because I realised my last reddit name was the same as my Instagram so got scared I’d get rumbled...

I have a JNMIL she’s awful. The stories are endless, but I’m getting better at handling her.

We have been summoned to her house this weekend for her birthday party.
So for my birthday she gave me a bottle of aftershave and gate crashed my lovely meal that my DH took me to (she was up in my town because her other son had just had a baby and they told her after two nights at theirs she had to make other plans because they wanted time alone) 
It was such a shit birthday, I didn’t want her there and she gave me a gift she had clearly bought from DH at the airport on her journey. She spelt my name wrong in my card too! I’ve been with DH for 15 yrs. 

So now we have to go to her birthday, attend a party, her twin sister will be there who is lovely, a few other family members but that’s it. No one likes her and she has no friends. Bearing in mind it’s not a joint birthday party... it’s all about her. BIL and SIL are going too with their little baby (the first grandchild) 
I don’t feel like she deserves my birthday attention but anytime she doesn’t get attention she bitches to everyone.

Can anyone offer advice on how to keep smiling at how to get thru this weekend without the drama? We’re an hour on a plane and are there for 2 nights, so can’t just leave.

DH knows what she’s like but doesn’t see her behaviour bad enough to go NC yet..."
194,"LO (who just turned two months where does the time go) is napping on my chest so I can’t get up and do anything to distract myself and I’ve been struggling a bit with coming to terms about going back to work on Friday and I’m just in overthinking mode Bc FDH pissed me off during this crisis that I’m internalizing. Also sorry for language. I’m really peeved rn. 

Honestly, I can’t believe FMIL robbed me of a peaceful transition into motherhood. I’m young. I turned 21 while pregnant. So this transition was already hard enough with societal pressures. But the fact that I didn’t even get to fully enjoy my own pregnancy and birth Bc this lady made it about herself is just really really making me angry today.  She’s backed off tremendously since FDH told her to fuck off essentially but I’m still pissed Bc she doesn’t understand (or chooses not to) what she did and why it isn’t okay. I know she’s going to start back up, but the reprieve is nice so I can at least process all the bullshit and mentally prepare for the next onslaught."
195,"Am I overreacting by not wanting to allow my MIL to feed my children anymore after this shit that she pulled?

My 9yo daughter became a vegetarian about 8 months ago (her friend's older sister's influence) and takes it surprisingly seriously, given her age. For some bizarre reason, my MIL has a serious bug up her ass about it and hates that my husband and I allow it. We had a small confrontation about it a few months ago, but she seemed to back off after I made it clear I wasn't interested in her input. 

On Friday night we had dinner with my husband's parents and she served spaghetti. It was a meat sauce for the rest of us, but when she gave my daughter her bowl, she said ""and a special veggie sauce just for you"" all sweetly. Halfway through her bowl, daughter started to panic and asked MIL if she was sure there was no meat in the sauce. MIL insisted there was none. I took her plate to inspect and sure enough, there was beef in her sauce. When I stated there was indeed meat in it, my daughter immediately began to cry. 

I took her into the living room to calm her down while husband confronted his mom. She at first insisted it was an accident, but after he established he didn't buy that for a second, she admitted it was intentional. She said she thought by reminding her how delicious meat was, she would ""give up that vegetarian nonsense"". She said she couldn't see what the big deal was and suggested we get daughter therapy because the fact she cried over it was ""very troubling and a sign something is wrong with her"".

At that point I insisted we leave. I was starting to seriously consider throwing the spagetti in the bitch's face, but knew it would traumatize the kids. In the car, we obviously explained to daughter that there was nothing wrong with her and grandma was 100% in the wrong. She seemed to have already come to that conclusion on her own, though.

MIL sent a half-assed text apology to my husband last night. Basically ""I shouldn't have done that, but... -insert essay about why eating meat is no big deal and daughter overreacted here-"" He hasn't responded because we're still trying to figure out what to say and how to handle the situation.

I'm beyond livid. He's trying to figure out things to say to get her to understand daughter's feelings, like asking her how she would feel if someone tricked her into eating a dog. However, I strongly feel like we shouldn't have to do that. We shouldn't have to defend our daughter's personal choice not to eat meat and her right to have that respected. We shouldn't have to try to validate her feelings of being deeply upset after she was tricked into doing something she is strongly morally opposed to by someone she trusted. 

I told my husband I don't trust his mother to feed my kids anymore. He thinks I'm overreacting and we should give her a second chance once the dust settles with this, but my trust is gone. She took it upon herself to decide my daughter was ""wrong"" for being a vegetarian and try to ""fix"" her. She decided she knows best and to ignore not only my daughter's boundaries, but ours as her parents not to push meat on her. 

It also worries me because our 5yo has a peanut allergy that she scoffs at. She's never tried to sneak her peanut products, but she's dismissed it as ""probably not serious"" and has said how people ""outgrow allergies, so she probably will too"". After this incident with the meat, I'm terrified she'll decide to ignore that food restriction too.

What do you guys think? Am I overreacting for feeling like she shouldn't be given a second chance when it comes to feeding my kids after this?"
196,"You can view my last post about this to get the backstory on this particular topic. 

We ended up seeing GMIL after church. The whole brood was there. But, BUT, SO and I got to have a nice time talking with GMIL hopefully not for the last time before she passes. She was in much better looking health that I anticipated, and her mental stability was totally there. I don’t doubt she fades into disillusion, but she was totally there when we were talking with her. 

She got to hold our LO squish her little legs and play with her hair. GMIL was so happy holding LO although LO jumped out of her arms and was running back and forth! She has about 3% of her vision, but she was able to see her little shape going back and forth. 

I also had a pleasant conversation with her talking about many different things. She loves my mom and kept telling me to give her a hug for her and that she hopes she’s doing okay. She eventually started talking about her health, and how she is ready in her heart for when God wants to take her. This brought both of us a lot of sadness, but mostly comfort. I’m glad she hasn’t been manipulated by FMIL into fearing for her last day. She is a wonderful woman and I wish we could be with her everyday. She is so lovely and kind.

I think we are going to try to visit with her again, I’d just super prefer it wasn’t in their house and somewhere out in public again. 

•••••••••••

Funny aspects of the dysfunctional people. 

Keep in mind, we haven’t have a “casual” moment after church with these people four months, meaning LO hasn’t seen the grandparents or aunts and uncles in four months. While I don’t hate FFIL, it must be humbling for him to have to coax LO to go into his arms, not that he is unrecognizable, more like unfamiliar with him. 

FMIL didn’t even look at me. She just stood there hanging over mine and GMIL’s conversation. I’m sure she was fuming when I was talking about my sister’s baby (she HATES my sister because of lies SIL1 has told them), how our babies loves to play with each other and we regularly go shopping with both of them. Also at the fact that GMIL was asking how my mom was doing and how much she loves her. 

None of the kids really said much to me other SIL2 &amp; 3 who are 10 and 4. I was around A TON when SIL 2 was growing up and she loves me, I wasn’t around as much for SIL 2, but the same can be said. It breaks my heart that FMIL so mercilessly ripped them out of the wedding party as SIL 2 kept asking about going and doing wedding things with me. 

But SIL1, O.M.G. She came around the corner with some random friend of her, picked up LO, and just started bawling like a baby. Now this is rather comical because anytime when she was younger and got caught in her web (which is where she is now, surprise surprise), she always started bawling the exact same attention seeking way. She eventually ran off with her friend to be consoled by her boyfriend, but was still crying half an hour later. Was she upset that getting to be in our LO’s life is a privilege and  it a right? That she isn’t a part of her life for lying about what I said? No longer being a bridesmaid because I asked her if she was actually in support of our marriage and actually wanted to be there, and she got mommy to step in and literally pulled every. single. kid. out of the wedding, including poor SIL? Sorry, you reap what you sow, and your just rolling in your self made misery 💁🏻‍♀️ also, SO didn’t even realize she was crying, and she never even said hi to him 😂

FMIL, without looking at me said “have a good night.” 

SIL2 has plenty of fun wedding stuff I told her about that she will inevitably talk about and drive FMIL crazy for the next few weeks 😂😂

I think both FFIL and FMIL have this illusion that everything is fine now. I’d bet FMIL thinks she has us in the bag and we are going to be obedient to her again. Unfortunately for them, after the wedding, we will sit down and talk about all the shitty things they’ve both done, but still mostly FMIL. I’m sure they still won’t have any sense of accountability and will deny everything and/or say “it’s all about perspective.” And boom, SO will be happy his mom was at the wedding, have the pictures to look over, and we can go back to NC. Because hun, we ain’t going to deal with this bullshit for the rest of our lives."
197,"Hi y’all, I’ve been lurking for a few months, but this is the first I’ve had something to post about since subscribing.  DH and I went to visit his family.  This includes JNMIL, JNFIL, JNSIL, and JNSIL’s serious live-in boyfriend (lets call him JYBF).  I’ll preface this by saying that DH was very in the FOG when we first got married, but a couple years in he came out of it and is completely reformed.  He now sees them for who they are and protects me from them as much as possible

I’m VLC with DH’s family.  I don’t think I’ve seen them since holidays last year.  The evening started out relatively drama free, but a couple hours in, things started going south.  It started with a whispered conversation between JNMIL and DH.  I didn’t know what they were talking about, but they ended up both teary-eyed, and I was very concerned.  I asked DH what was wrong, he said he would tell me later, and JNMIL chastised him.  She didn’t want him to tell me, which I thought was weird.  I was very concerned because DH doesn’t cry often.  

Then JNMIL brings up holidays and wanted to discuss when we were going to get together.  JNSIL flipped out.  Apparently, she and JYBF had been arguing about how they would handle holidays.  He wanted to alternate which family they would spend Christmas with, and she was insisting that they had to spend EVERY Christmas with her family.  So then they were kinda arguing and JNSIL kept bringing up the first Christmas after DH and I got married and describing how distraught she was that they didn’t have Christmas morning together as a FAAAAMMMMIIIILLLLYYY.  JNMIL had also suggested that we do a secret Santa instead of everyone buying for everyone.  JNSIL and JNFIL veto’ed that, and in the ensuing discussion, DH said that JNSIL didn’t have the majority opinion, and so JNSIL points at me and JYBF and says that we don’t count.  I was very offended, especially because I was staying quiet throughout the discussion.  Then DH brings up that we don’t have to do secret Santa, but maybe we should establish budgets, to which JNSIL snidely comments “well we know your limit is $50 for everyone”.  Which is not true and I was very offended by because we spend more than that on them.  JNMIL also seemed shocked that we spend more than that, which was also offensive.  And then JNFIL and JNMIL start in on DH about how they never had a limit for them as kids and they always made sure they got whatever they wanted for Christmas.  I grew up very poor, so this was also very uncomfortable for me.  

Shortly after, we go to leave.  I could tell that JYBF was upset about how JNSIL had completely disregarded his feelings regarding holidays and had said that he (and I) didn’t count in decisions, essentially because we weren’t family.  

So when we got back in the car, DH tells me what he and his mom were discussing.  Well, his family has a “family diamond”.  When the oldest son is ready to get married, dad buys mom a new diamond, and the family diamond is given to the son to put in a setting for an engagement ring.  Well, DH is the only son...and I didn’t get the family diamond.  When we were ready to get married, she said she wasn’t ready to give it up.  I never believed that.  She and I never got along.  I have tons of horror stories that I could tell.  I’ve always known that she didn’t give it to DH because she didn’t approve of him marrying me.  But JNMIL and JNFIL love JYBF.  So JNMIL told DH that she was going to give the diamond to JYBF to propose to JNSIL.  DH told her that if she did that, he would never forgive her and he would cut all ties with her.  She agreed to not give it to him, but I doubt this is the end of it, we’ll see.  

I could really use some advice.  I’m so proud of my DH for standing his ground and calling his mom on her bullshit.  He defended me more substantially than he ever has before.  I’m not sure how to handle that.  I told him how I was so sorry that his mother did that to him, and that I was so happy that he stood up for me that way.  I just don’t know if telling him that is enough (I’m a bit socially inept).  And I also sort of feel like I should reach out to JYBF and just offer him a sounding board to vent.  I don’t want to offer him advice, because I don’t want to interfere and get in the middle.  But I feel like I’m the one who’s been where he’s at with this family, and I should try to support him.  What do you guys think?  Any advice is greatly appreciated."
198,"So guys, I spoke up, I couldn't help it. If you'll recall, my JNMIL is the one that brought us government cheese and a myriad of other treats from the food pantry as a house warming gift. She is a martyr of a woman who is fully capable of working, but doesn't, and milks all systems everywhere. My JNSIL is an apple that hasn't even fallen from the tree she's so close, and gave JNMIL a bunch of leftover baby food to give to us which she acquired while on WIC. We are hard working, self made, upper middle class people and perfectly capable of providing for ourselves and our infant LO. There are people out there who actually need these thing,  we are not those people. But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we were visiting my SO's JY grandparents when out of nowhere MIL asked my SO what kind of formula LO uses. Boy did my ears perk right up. SO looked at me as my head whipped around, he's so smart. I told her what kind with a questioning tone. And she looks at SO while she quietly starts to say ""they have formula at the pantry...it's normally so expensive..."" I immediately cut her off with my out loud disgusted face and told her do not get any, that is there for people who need it. I looked away and back to the grandparents who were loving on LO. End of discussion. DO NOT TAKE THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE NEED AND GIVE THEM TO US. STOP IT!"
199,"This is an old story, but I’ve been watching a couple of movies and it brought up this memory.

Two years into our relationship, my SO and I started to seriously discuss marriage. We both agreed that it was something that we may want in the future but we were very happy in our relationship and getting married was the be all and end all. We were going to be together for the rest of our lives regardless. 

Over the years we’ve decided that it’ll happen when it happens, if it will happen and all. If it doesn’t it’s not an issue. At the moment it’s just a technicality as the Army sees us as domestic partners as does the government. 

However, this has don’t stopped wedding bells ringing in MIL’s head when it comes to SO and I.

It’s worth noting that before this conversation happened, my MIL kept dropping hints to my SO about proposing. If she knew we were together, she’d text him going “such and such place is a beautiful place to pop the question” and so on. 

I honestly believe that the reason why SO hasn’t proposed is because of her nagging early in our relationship and it put him off. 

MIL would talk to SO about us getting engaged and what kind of wedding we would like to have and SO was very honest with her. He told her that engagement not at the forefront of our minds and if it does happen we’re torn between a courthouse wedding with family dinner after or elopement.

Well, hearing that set MIL’s head into a spin. 

“What do you mean? Courthouse wedding? Eloping? It’s EVERY girl’s dream to have a big wedding!”

Firstly, it’s not mine. The biggest I want is a family dinner after a courthouse wedding. I don’t want the church and the fluffy dress. It’s just not me. It’s not my SO either as both of us hate being in the spotlight.

SO conveyed all of this to MIL but that didn’t stop her from going on.

“What about her parents? Surely her Dad will be disappointed that he can’t walk his daughter down the isle!”

SO and I have been together 5 years in December and she has NEVER met my parents. What she knows of them is what I’ve told her and the brief book of faces conversations she had with my mother before MIL blocked me. She has no idea what my parents would want.

My Dad, who is kind of traditional and would be thrilled if SO asked for his blessing before proposing, has told us multiple times not to worry about what he or my mum or anyone else wants and just do what we want to do. This comes after his own wedding to my mother went from a small thing to a extravaganza with nearly 200 people that my parents barely knew! So he was totally behind us doing what we want. Would he love to walk me down the isle? Yes. Is he going to hold it against us if we elope one day? No.

SO ended up telling MIL that he’s not worried which set her to pouting for a little bit before finally saying:

“Surely you’ll get married if she falls pregnant!”

This was not the first, nor would it be the last time, that MIL would make a comment like this. When one of SO’s brothers had a child before marriage it was expected they get married and they did. It didn’t last long however (that is a story in itself) but they did the “right” thing and got married.

My parents did the same thing. Their wedding was planned in 6 weeks because Mum was 5 months pregnant by the beginning of September. Dad wanted Mum and him to have the same last name on the birth certificate and considering they were going to get married the following year it made sense to bring it up in time.

However, Mum has always told me that if she had the choice again she’d wait until after I was born so they could do their wedding the way they wanted. She’s always told me that if I found myself in the same position, not to feel as if I had to get married.

I told SO very early on that if we had an oops that I didn’t expect to get married. “A baby is not a good reason to get married.”

My SO remember exactly what I said and told his MIL (and I quote): “Sorry, PsychNanny has already told me that she doesn’t want to get married if WE fall pregnant. It’s not a good enough reason.”

Disapproval was strong after that. She even made the comment last Christmas when I told her that she was more likely to get a baby before a wedding that “Pa would not approve.”

SO’s Pa is one of the loveliest men I have ever met. He loves his grandsons and their wives/partners and would only say something like that if we were asking his advice. Us not getting married if we have a baby would not have him looking at us disapprovingly, like she probably would. 

Despite all this it hasn’t stopped her asking when SO is going to propose, even going as far as to ask “when is he going to make an honest woman of me” at SO’s brothers engagement party. We got a great bit of delight in saying “marriage is an archaic conception put in place by the church and government to control people” (my SO) and “we’re happy living in sin” (Me). She laughed but I know full well that she probably didn’t like our answers, especially as we said them in front of her Aunt and Uncle.

She has as much of a hang up on marriage as she does on their last name. A name that wasn’t even hers to begin with! All women marrying in the family are expected to take it and give up their maiden names. Us not being married and with a baby on the way right now is going to cause some fuss as “whose name is the baby going to have!”

I think she’s going to be shocked when I tell her that baby girl is getting her father’s last name, not because he’s her father and it’s traditional but because it’s easier to spell than my own."
200,"So I recently broke off my relationship to my (now ex) fiancee and with it created a permanent wall between myself and that manipulative FMIL. And while I'm doing much better now, I thought of a funny story from the past that I figured I'd share laughs and good times all around. Sound good? Great! (I'll be referring to everyone as if they were current tense just because its easier on my brain)

So a couple years back the thoughts of getting engaged to my SO came to mind. At the time she was a lot more open to discussion and we talked about all of the topics, from engagement to children and everything in between. So there was much talking, much thinking on my own, and much research into her ring size and what kind of ring she'd like. You know, typical proposal stuff. Of course eventually the time comes for me to ask JYFFIL for SO's hand in marriage, which he gives very happily. But he attaches this line to the end, ""Make sure to ask \*JNFMIL's name\* about the proposal as well."" Now this struck me a bit, not because of the traditional 'only ask the father for permission' rule that accompanies engagements, but because in a previous conversation, FMIL had made it clear that she *didn't* want to know about the engagement, so she could be surprised as well. Nonetheless, I end up asking her as well, and that seems to be the end of it.

That was near the end of November, a few years ago as I mentioned before, and for the next **2 and a half months** FMIL would not stop pestering me about it. We're talking making 'subtle' references about it (about as subtle as a rock through the windshield \*wink wink\*), suddenly bringing up Valentine's Day and how romantic proposals would be that day to SO, really just pushing her limits. I'm steaming with frustration, as I had told her not to do that so that SO doesn't catch on, to which she replied ""I just can't help myself"" but made no attempts to stop. The closer we got to Valentine's day, the more fervent she became about it. Any time I was alone with her, all I'd hear would be, ""You should do it on Valentine's day!"" ""Valentine's would be so romantic!"" ""So you're doing it on Valentine's day right?"" The last one, for those who understand manipulative psychological cues, struck a particularly angry cord with me, so I started planning.

So I'll be the first to say I can be extra petty when pushed. I have no problem making my point clear in the most passive aggressive way possible, or making sure they're aware it was on purpose. I only do it, however, when I've been pushed to a point where I'm not quite angry, but definitely feel more than a little annoyed. That being said, Valentine's day comes around and the day goes as one would expect. We eat chocolate, me and SO hang out in her room, and we ate dinner. FMIL is bubbling over with barely hidden excitement, giving me 'looks' every few minutes like ""Now?"" ""How about now?"" all day and night long. As the night begins coming to a close, I'm hanging out in SO's room once more and I'm looking down at my watch every couple minutes. SO asks what I keep looking at my watch for, I said I was waiting for something. I wait until its **12:15 am on February 15th** before getting down on my knee and proposing to that lovely lady. SO is screaming in excitement, tackles me onto the bed and is laughing and crying and hugging and its all adorable and one of my favorite memories.

As I'm exiting the room, SO running from place to place showing first FFIL then FMIL, I make eye contact with FMIL. The look on her face as I glance at the clock then back at her again, I ***WISH*** I could frame it and hang it from my wall. To add insult to injury SO, who was unaware of FMIL's intentions, decided it would be easier to celebrate the engagement on the 14th every year. So anniversary is February 14th, but every year after proposing I made sure to wait until 12:15 before saying 'Happy Anniversary' to SO, usually in the presence of FMIL. Probably one of the few things besides SO I'll miss about the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Wanted to propose, FMIL wouldn't stop fussing about Valentine's day proposing, so I proposed the day after Valentine's day at 12:15 am instead."
201,"Hi everyone!
New user here. Without writing a book, my MIL and I have had a Rocky relationship since me and DH got married. I have tried for years to make our relationship better, dinner dates, road trips, cookouts, etc. I always plan our get together, but she never invites me to anything or calls/texts to check up on me. Until now that my LO is here. Now she will just text me to see how LO is doing and when she can come over to see LO, but still doesn't really have a relationship with me. The sad thing is I know if I needed something I could call her and she would do whatever I needed. My question is what do I do to make our relationship better? I feel like I've tried and tried, until I feel like I'm just done now, especially since I feel like she only wants something to do with me because I'm the mother of her grandchild.

Also when she does come over she basically acts like I don't exist for the most part. She's just obsessive over LO. In a 2-3 hour period she might directly talk to me 10-15 mins tops."
202,"my mom and i have had a close relationship for many years... until now.

i was given the privilege of going with her to see my relatives in europe. before this, she had (still has) a full time job as a manager at a furniture store near my state’s major city. the transition from not seeing her at all to seeing her 24/7 has been.. interesting, to say the least.

during this vacation i wasn’t treated my age because my european relatives have not seen me in person for 10+ years. whenever i said something to my mother, she would repeat it to everyone else, and they would laugh like i was a toddler that just said a sentence that was too funny due to her age. the entire time, i was smothered; even when i needed time alone i would always get checked on, even when i was just checked on five minutes before. all the while, i never had time to reflect on anything or process my feelings, i had constipation the entire trip, and all we did was do things that everyone else wanted to do. i never had a choice on where to go and whenever i did i would have to wait a few days because they put their plans over mine. 

so, obviously i was very frustrated. and i needed someone to help me process my feelings. so, of course, i turned to my mom because she was the only person that i knew that could help me. however, when i told her that i was angry, she blew me off and said that she didn’t know what to tell me. this whole time she was having the time of her life, hanging out with family that she hasn’t seen in years, eating sardines, and taking in the view of the spanish lakes. she was perfectly capable of taking me aside and helping me talk things out, but she didn’t. so, instead, i locked myself in the room i was staying in for hours. finally, after an awkward lunch because i was so withdrawn from all the stress i was going through, mom confronted me. 

whenever she confronts me after i don’t tell her anything for a while, it can be explosive. and in this case, it was. she started crying and telling me how she hasn’t seen her family in years (she sees her parents every year), and that she just wants happy memories with them. now, that i understand, but you shouldn’t really leave the people that need you hanging despite this. recently i was fobbing off my boyfriend’s feelings because i wanted to spend time with my brother and once i realized what had happened i apologized and made it right with him again. you should never take your loved ones for granted, even when you’re trying to spend time with someone else. 

after i tried my best to explain that i haven’t been having a good vacation because i’ve been smothered by my extended family, etc, etc, my mother sort of.. gave up. she didn’t have time to try to understand me because she was meeting my great aunts and uncles at a bar with my grandparents. she threw herself on the bed and asked me, frustratedly: “why are you so complicated??” by this time, i was also sobbing, and after some more talking she wanted me to hug my grandparents because i “made them uncomfortable” at lunch and my grandma blamed herself for my behavior. i was in hysterics the whole time, and when they left, they left me confused. what did i take away from that conversation that improved my relationship with my mother?? later, when i asked my mom if we were okay, she said yes, but to me it just didn’t add up in my head. 

by the time i got home, i was so tired of my mother. i didn’t talk to her for a week. 

here’s the second part of my story.. it involves the family dog, this time. 

i have misophonia. the dog is loud. my mom gives him a treat every morning before she left for work. i asked if he could eat outside because his licking noises triggered me. mom wouldnt compromise by taking the dog out of earshot and didn’t think it was reasonable to not let him eat raw meat on the rug in front of me. 

the next day, i was washing dishes after a sunday roast. i caught the dog licking the gravy off the plates that my mother gave him. twice. i thought this was gross because our dishwasher has a history of not thoroughly washing our dishes/sanitizing them. mad, i went upstairs after finishing my chore and my mom dared to bitch about why i’m “always mad” when she asked me to do something like that argument involving the dog contaminating the plates never happened. 

today, i found Sam-E pills next to my bathroom sink because my mom had left them there. i took these pills with me on vacation because they helped me cope with the stress of being alive while traveling abroad. even on vacation, my mom blamed my words and actions on my hormones. i am almost 19 years old. i’m not hormonal anymore. i think mom left these pills to send me a message. and frankly, i’m insulted. 

it’s hard to accept my mother when she doesn’t try to understand me and puts the dog’s and her own needs higher than mine. i want to explain to her, i really do, but it all just feels like a lost cause at the moment. a lot of things in my life are getting harder; i want my brother to accept me, i want to get a license (i can’t get a license without spending time with my mom, and im getting more hesitant about that by the day), and i’m saving up to get a car. 

what are your thoughts? is my mom mean, am i an asshole?? both? please help me out."
203,"I have been struggling with whether or not to post this as I feel it is a bit of a nuclear revenge type situation and not how I usually conduct myself.  But it worked very well so maybe it will help someone else. TLDR on the bottom.

Like a lot of MILs on this sub, my MIL is special.  She is, as her son likes to say, incapable of respecting boundaries.  And if she is not happy, then no one can be happy.  And she is never happy about anything.  She has always been very upset about my existence and for a long time, she would constantly say bad things about me behind my back to destroy my relationships with other people.  And it worked.  I would notice people being very cold to me at gatherings even though we were very friendly before. 

Although it was already pretty bad when we got married, it got exponentially worse when my baby was born.  She would complain to others about how she never got to see my child (a lie because at that time, we saw her every week) and how “[my child] doesn’t even recognize his/her own grandmother!”.  And then all these flying monkeys would come and repeat the same things.  In addition to all the “helpful advice”, they would say things like what kind of mother keeps her child away from his/her own grandmother (lies) and push me to let my baby go for overnight visits (that one I never allowed, so her beautiful nursery and too-of-the-line baby gear never got used).  It was really frustrating, and especially difficult because at that time, I had postpartum anxiety and also, I wasn’t able to talk back to the flying monkeys who otherwise didn’t do me harm. 

So how did I get these flying monkeys to stop?  Well, like I said, my MIL was never happy about anything, or rather anyone.  And everytime I saw her, it was a venting session about her life and her family and friends.  So yes, she bad-mouthed me, but she also bad-mouthed others.  And I have an excellent memory.  So at one point, I got so sick of the flying monkeys, I started responding to their intrusions by saying: “You know, what you just said is completely untrue.  I wish you would ask me for clarification instead of assuming everything you heard about me is true.  For instance, I have heard that (depending on what I know about the person):

all your income from [X] is under the table, and you don’t pay any taxes, 

you are unable to manage your finances and spend all your money on cat food instead,

you are just lazy and don’t want to work, and doesn’t really need disability but just want to cheat the government, 

are snobs that only care about material things and think you are too good for everyone else,

but I would certainly never just believe that without talking to you.”

Well, the reaction is as you would expect, complete surprise and then major anger.  And they would then hang up or leave shortly after.  And gradually, the flying monkeys stopped as they started talking amongst themselves.  Because you see, all of these things I said could only have come from my MIL.  And they knew that.  Except in addition to the factual things they told her, I included her commentary.  Ruined a lot of friendships and family relationships for her.  I do feel bad about that.  It honestly wasn’t my intention, as I just wanted the flying monkeys to stop.  And they stopped almost completely.

TLDR : I stop flying monkeys by using my MIL’s bad mouthing against her."
204,"TW for self harm, transphobia, potentially child abuse?, also pretty long, sorry


Six months ago, I moved cross country to live with my SO, who has been beyond patient with the way I've incessantly coddled my entire family back home, especially my mother. For context, my mother has a general history of being overly controlling, but some incidents stand out: 


-before moving out, my mother egged my father into cyberstalking my SO for a week and telling me she was ""horrified"" by the prospect of me dating this woman, leading to a confrontation in which I ended up submitting and told my parents my SO and I aren't dating. She continues to make critical remarks about how rude she thinks my SO is whenever she gets the chance, and pries about her professional life constantly despite thinking we're roommates.


-after moving out, there were a few weeks where my mother threatened to call the cops on me if I didn't call daily.


-I am a semi-out and proud trans woman [1 year of hrt coming up next month! : ^ )] and have been aware of my gender dysphoria for the past 5 years (starting when I was 16). I have come out to my parents 6 times in those 5 years, and for the first 5 times was told to go back into the closet each and every time for reasons ranging from ""you'd make an ugly woman"" to ""we need you to give us resources on how to handle our child coming out as trans"" to ""no, you aren't. give it some more thought"". Throughout this time, my parents expressed disgust and disdain whenever I did anything that didn't conform with my assigned gender, and after four years of this I snapped and secretly started HRT without their assistance or input. Only when I was in the process of moving out did they finally start begging me to stay with promises that they would respect my gender.


-My mother still only has conditional respect for my gender. Any time she gets upset with me (for things like not calling with good news or for not calling often enough or for not working enough hours out here) she drops back to using my deadname.


-My mother and shared therapists. I was diagnosed with autism and ADD at a young age and have been in therapy for over a decade as a result. At first, she would have individual meetings with the childhood development specialist I saw as a kid, which seems normal. However, I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist in high school after I developed a depressive disorder, and she continued her practice of meetings with them until she ended up just scheduling her own therapy sessions with my therapist more often than I saw him. I don't really know how ethical this is.


-My depression was accompanied by a self harm habit that began at the same time. I would take sharpened pencils, jab them into my hand, and break off the tips, leaving them in my skin. Self harm is ofc never safe, but the pencil tips were graphite and non toxic. My mother found out about this a week or so after my first episode, and when she did, she had my father hold me down to the couch as she tried to cut and tear the graphite out of my already healing hand with a pair of tweezers as punishment. I continued self harming until last year. None of us ever brought the incident again and I repressed this memory until maybe five or so months ago. I have not told my parents I remember.


Despite all this, I've tried to stay on good terms with my family, and have remained closeted to most of my extended family to avoid rocking the boat any more than me moving out to Seattle did. (we're a very close knit large Portuguese Catholic family, and 3 out of ~50 of us have moved out of the same city in MA since we immigrated to the US in the 60s) However, since moving out, I've begun to ask other family members about my mother's actions throughout my life, and have invariably gotten tearful responses that she did so much to support me through my developmental disorders and that I have no right to criticize her. Even family members sympathetic to me transitioning have given me this same song and dance about how much she's given up to raise me and that I should be grateful and humor her until she eventually calms down.


This summer, my younger and only brother left for college, leaving my mom and dad with a bad case of empty nest syndrome. Yesterday, my dad left for a weeklong business trip, and he exhorted me to start calling my mom daily again, because ""bad gas travels quickly in a small town"". Before he left, my mother called me several times before I left for work to ""check in"". I am exhausted of this. I was going to come clean about my relationship with my SO this week and drop to LC with my mother because I feel absolutely terrible having to hide her from the family, but I'm worried my mother will have a downward spiral while she's alone in the house. At the same time, I'm exhausted of the deadnaming and judgment and my own cowardice. I just want to live my own life without worrying about family constantly."
205,"Backstory: My mother, MIL, FIL, BIL, and now XH are boat-rockers. My (now deceased) father, SMIL, BIL's wife, and I are boat-steadiers. XH and I were together for 20 years, much of that time happily, but he started rocking the boat so hard that I couldn't steady it and it capsized. I moved out in July and we've been sharing custody of our two (upper elementary/junior-high-aged) children. XH replaced me with another woman right away. New GF is a boat-steadier as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now story: XH legally can't have overnight guests with the children present until March. He tried to harass me about it, but I got my lawyer to get his lawyer to shut him up. Their new plan is for GF to move in with MIL until March. MIL has crawled up GF's butt the way she always tried to crawl up my butt but I had a stronger sphincter I guess. I could never stand being around her longer than three hours at a time and have never stayed the night at her house. I don't hate MIL and she's helping me out by driving younger daughter to and from afterschool activities that take place when XH and I are both at work. She also helps my mom, they're the same age but my mom is in worse health than MIL. So I don't hate MIL but I don't fully trust her either, and why...did she offer...to move GF in with her??? Can she play both sides of the field, cozying up to me for access to her grandchildren and to GF for access to her son? Is there something nefarious going on here or am I overreacting to a normal thing due to my nerves being shot?"
206,"I haven’t talked to my MIL in weeks. It’s been wonderful for my mental and physical health.

Today we corresponded over FB messenger in my attempt to reach out to her about planning to see a musical together.

Sheesh. I was reminded about the stress she omits and her complete lack of chill. I felt my body tense up at her complicated responses in trying to plan this simple outing. Sometimes I feel bad about not seeing her more, but then I remember why I don’t see her and the negative/awkward/draining ways in which she interacts with me and DH."
207,"I've always had issues with my mom keeping me in the family loop. Most parents call everyone when something major happens, I find out at weekly family dinners after the fact because people are gossiping. Since we've been NC, we don't go to family dinners, so I've heard nothing.

Last week when she randomly showed up at the house, my husband was shoveling and waved her off, she made a dramatic statement of ""Cee has me blocked so I couldn't tell her about grandma's cancer!"" I call grandma and she's having bleeding from a cancer MEDICATION, and needs it evaluated, but no cancer. She had a lump removed last January. 

This morning, he receives this text from Nmom:

""Cee does not respond to my calls or textsand, of course, has blocked me on messenger.
My mother's surgery went well, although she required 2 units of blood and has more surgery scheduled. It stresses her out to talk about it, and if you choose to tell Cee, dont have her post it to facebook. She will be back in the hospital on Tuesday.

YB1 was not seriously injured in his car accident, but since his car was totalled he had to get a different one. He drives to SD today, and Iowa next week.

YS started her first job as an OT today.

YB2 moves back to Bismarck in December.

I think that it is a tragedy that I am unable to watch DD1 and DD2 grow up and surround them with the love that they deserve and is thier right, and that I will never get to meet my grandson. However, I will abide by your decision and move on, as thier is nothing that I can do about it.
For my grandchildren's sake, I wish you the best.""

So this morning I made a shitload of calls to figure out what was happening, turns out it's all true.

Gma had a DNC and needed blood, nothing too serious but not great and now has a hysterectomy tomorrow. I called and talked to her, she was very apologetic didn't know and promised to have Gpa call and update me.

YB1 is a JustNo, (his wife caused issues during our time in the NICU, posted to JustNoFamily), this is the 2nd car he's totalled but he's fine and my parents are already looking for a new car for my 26yo brother

The news with my other siblings isn't major but it's upsetting I didn't get to hear it from them. YB2 was in town and didn't call us even though my husband has been going out of his way asking him to let us know.

I don't understand about the FB quip. I have an account I use, mostly for the purpose of business connections and networking, and photos of my kids for long distance friends and family. I've never posted anything private- ecspecially concerning relatives!

My husband is starting to get angry. He wants to reply, but knows it won't go anywhere. My JYaunt on my dad's side suggested a reply, but only acknowledging the positive things and thanking for keeping us in the loop (car accidents and surgeries are very serious things I would like to know about). I want to send a text ""for every sassy text we get, your silent treatment is extended by 2 months"", but what if someone dies and no one tells me? No other relatives are blocked, and mom is not blocked on my husband's phone for this reason. My dad can contact me at any time but I have only been harassed by my mom, no attempts on his part. Why did all these people give the worst person all the informational power?"
208,"MIL has been living with my girlfriend and I for 5 months now. She has been going through a rough patch from in life and we have given her a place to stay temporarily. However, without fail every time we are having a discussion, she will interrupt whatever is being said by relating it back to something bad going on in her life. Her work, her ex, her friends. Everything! 

She doesn’t give anybody else the opportunity and just continues to interrupt. I really like her and I feel guilty for being resentful but it is just getting so frustrating I’m not sure what to do. 

I don’t understand how somebody could just continually try and dominate conversations with stories of herself and never ask anything about anyone else and just wants people to listen the inane babble for so so sooo long."
209,"I already posted here some time ago and didn’t think I’d have to do it again but it seems like I do. My husband and me, we’re raising my niece and nephews due to my sister and her husband passing away. I explained the reasons behind this situation in my first post and you can read it if you want more information as to why what happened happened. 

My 11-year-old niece and 7-year-old nephew started going to school this September and I quit my job to be home with my 1-year-old nephew. He’s too little for a kindergarten and there’s nobody we could leave him with, so my husband and I came to a decision that I will be stay-at-home aunt until he’s about 4 or 5. So right now my husband is the only one in our family who’s working and MIL doesn’t like this decision very much.

Yesterday my husband was home with the children and I drove MIL to the town because she had to see a doctor. And while we were driving, MIL was like ”You know, it’s very unfair that my son is now the only person to earn money for your household. You’re a grown woman and you’re sitting at home.” 

I said that unfortunately, for now, it’s the only way because there’s a baby who has just learned to walk and obviously, we cannot leave him home alone. He’s way way too little. And it was actually my husband’s idea, it’s not like I forced him. We decided this together. 

MIL started to talk about knowing a nanny with very good recommendations. My husband and I, have had considered this option before but quickly realized that nannies are a no-no for us. They could have their recommendations signed by Jesus Christ Himself, it wouldn’t matter. There’s no way we’d let a stranger inside our house while we’re gone and leave them alone with our children, especially a child so small he cannot even really tell us if the nanny is doing something malicious. 

MIL was like ”Well, then I’ll be more than happy to babysit! I’m retired and have nothing much to do anyway! You both will be able to work without worries. I know how to take care of babies, I’m older than you after all.” 

I said – hell no. Absolutely not, over my dead body. Considering MIL’s attitude to this whole situation – being glad my sister died so that I could have her kids, thinking the kids should call me mom and wanting to be a grandma – there’s no way I’ll leave her alone with the children, especially the youngest one. Even though at this age he doesn’t understand much, she might still do something vile to him. I don’t trust her at all.

She offended and thought I’m just saying this because I want to sit at home and not do any kind of work and spend money and leave everything on my husband’s shoulders. It’s not true. I have never lived off of my husband, even though he has offered me to. I have always worked. And when the baby nephew will be old enough for kindergarten, I will go back to work. It’s not like I feel very comfortable that he’s the only one working. But now there are circumstances that make us refuse something.

Later that evening my husband told me she called him and told him to be a man and show his wife where her place is because it’s not normal for a woman to sit at home. My husband told her he will show her where her place is if she doesn’t stop meddling in our family’s business. She’s raging because we don’t let her babysit my nephew, hopefully, she puts that out of her mind because that’ll never happen. I would never trust her with the baby."
210,"Alright, alright, alright. 

I’ve lurked for a while, but now it’s time to spill. Long and rambly ahead.

Husband and I have been together for four years. My husband had no relationship with my FIL and SMIL for about two years prior to me coming into the picture (long, drawn out, abusive divorce that drug husband in the middle of it). Me, being naive and thinking I knew it all, encouraged him to mend the relationship for the sake of our future kids. So he played nice, we started trying to do regular visits and holidays. Turns out, he was doing something right, because they are the most narcissistic, disgusting individuals I’ve ever met. Like, the kind that’s super polite and acts nice. But they’re not and you know it’s fake. They’re also the kind that take a mile when you give them an inch. 

We had a baby 8 months ago (first grandkid first them), and we had to set some hard and fast boundaries as FIL was making me pretty uncomfortable. I 100% don’t trust him to be around my daughter alone. With husband and I both being in graduate school, working full time, and living life with a baby, we were pretty surprised (not) to find out they weren’t satisfied with biweekly visits, and would complain about how it wasn’t fair that we live ten minutes from my parents, but 30 minutes from them. *insert eye roll.* So four months ago, we went over for dinner. Teenage SIL took about 100 pictures of our daughter - totally fine - all I asked was that none get posted on social media, as we wanted to contain the exposure of our daughter as much as possible (nice way of saying immature SIL is super irresponsible on the internet and I don’t want my daughter tied into it. But it’s kind of a rule for everyone.) SMIL took great offense and encouraged SIL to delete/block me on social media. Honestly, no big deal. But then she told SIL to post pictures of my daughter because “she has a right to as they baby’s aunt.” A thread of texts ensued, where I politely asked them to remove the pictures, and told them I felt as though my role as a parent was disrespected with those actions. SMIL dove into saying how I disrespected her as a mother to a special needs child (other SIL is special needs, not this offender), and I needed to remember that her daughters were special and have “different rules” that they play by. In the end, she definitely didn’t listen to my position, but the pictures did get removed. Or so I hear, as I’m still blocked. 🤷🏻‍♀️

It’s been four months and FIL and SMIL have yet to ask about daughter. SMIL hasn’t even attempted to contact us. Husband is done. He’s back to no contact, and FIL  won’t take the hint. FIL still calls and leaves voicemails about the eventful things he does each week. Never asks husband to call or tells him he misses him, etc. Just leaves rambling voicemails about his awesome life. And then sends the occasional “we would like to see you guys a minimum of twice a week, and as parents, we have that right” text. 

Now the holidays are approaching and I’m starting to get anxiety about whether I should encourage making plans with them, as it’s daughter’s first holiday season. My family is very close, and my mom feels the need to insert her opinions about the situation (she thinks we should try harder with them solely because FIL’s sperm is responsible for my husband, and that apparently warrants some respect.) Husband says no. He wants nothing to do with them, but respects my wishes if I feel passionate enough about them. I respect him, but I also don’t want to take away a part of my child’s life that I’ll definitely have to explain later on.

What’s my next move?"
211,"Well guys, I took a dual pronged approach to confronting MIL and it has worked out well so far. In addition to calling her and essentially pinning her to the wall for an explanation on the ""baby shower,"" I recently put out on the book of faces something along the lines of:

*""To our dear friends and family: DH and I are very excited to bring baby into the world - As we all live so far apart, DH and I have decided that we will not be having a baby shower. as we do not wish to place undue logistical stress on our friends and family. If you are still wishing to gift something for baby, please know that we sincerely appreciate it! For interested persons, we are registered on xxxxxxx under xxxxxxxx. Love, DH and kimjiheyy* 

So far, it's worked out marvelously for us. My mom went ham on the registry and spent close to $500, which totally shocked me because it was extremely generous of her and a lot of money to spend IMO. We've had a few other things shown as ""purchased"" but none have actually shipped to our house, so perhaps my MIL had them shipped to her place to open at this ""family dinner that isn't a baby shower.""

So although I took a direct approach with her individually, I also made that very blunt albeit somewhat passive aggressive social media post regarding baby showers and ***tagged all the family, including her, in the post.*** 

DH thinks I need to just let it go and that I am ""fixating"" on this when in the grand scheme of things, it's not the end of the world. I mean, he's not wrong, but you're not gonna tell little ol' hormonal pregnant ME that....

Oh and as a little side story - MIL ""got a bunch of baby stuff for free from a friend for us."" But it's all baby stuff from the 90s and duplicates of shit we already have from my first pregnancy. When told that we wouldn't need that stuff as we already had it, I got mega pouty face and ""okay well we will just keep it up here then, for when we baby sit for a few days."" Record scratch - whut? The items that she is talking about are for an infant. I am not leaving an INFANT without his mother, for more than a few hours at a time, and certainly not for DAYS. I told her ""But MIL, that stuff is for little babies and we won't be traveling to you when they will be little enough to use it as it's a 7hr drive and babies don't do well on long road trips. Perhaps the church nursery will get more use from it?"" CBF for daysssssssssss. I get she was trying to be nice and save us money, but, just no. The jumper saucer will likely get used during a much later future visit but certainly not the small baby swaddle chair thing that vibrates and only holds up to 15 lbs. Or the bumbo because [it's bad for baby's hips and legs development](https://blog.dinopt.com/bumbo-is-a-no-go/)!!

MIL is very intent on ""helping"" but doesn't ask what needs done, she just does stuff and then gets upset when her hard work is not rewarded or was unnecessary. She is learning though I think, slowly but surely."
212,"So ive (40ishF) been married for over 16 years to dh (late40sM) and Christmas every year is a shitshow of JNMIL getting butt hurt. 
I established the first year that Xmas morning is for my immediate family. DH &amp; I the first year. DH &amp; I and kid(s) every year since. That leaves Friday before, Saturday before, Sunday before(if Xmas isn’t on those days) plus Xmas eve &amp; Xmas day after noon to get together with family. We live in the same town as my parents &amp; ILs, so no need to split holidays. We do 2 meals on thanksgiving, 2 on Easter. It’s ridiculous but we love the memories our kids make with cousins. For some reason Christmas always involves hurt feelings &amp; jnMIL thinking I’m an ass. 

The first 10 or so years, DHs extended family gets together on Xmas eve. So since we were with ILs (plus all aunts/uncles etc) we would spend Xmas night with MY family. And all 10 years MIL cries that we always go to my parents on Xmas day &amp; it’s not fair to her. DH explains ‘we are with you on Xmas eve...’ but you’d think we abandoned her. Typically we end up doing an immediate family GTG with ILs the weekend before and my schedule is wide open...but BIL &amp; SIL have other stuff going on and it gets difficult some years but we’ve always found time to get together.. so if you are following along, that’s a small Xmas party with immediate family &amp; Xmas eve with big family. 2 parties with the ILs. 

The next 3-4 years, our children have been involved in church choir which means they sing on Xmas eve Mass (4-5pm) so we get to the Xmas eve party late, usually after Santa showed up &amp; handed out gifts to the little kids &amp; you’d think we were the worst parents for prioritizing church over Santa. MIL would beg us to skip Mass to be at the family GTG, but DH was not having it. So still 2 Xmas parties with ILs, but we were late to 1 &amp; you’d think we abandoned MIL again. 

Then the extended family decided Xmas eve was too hard (as all the cousins are grown &amp; married &amp; less were coming because of family obligations) so last year they moved the party to the Saturday before. Great! We can do immediate family with MIL party on Xmas eve! Mil cries that since we are at church until 5:00 it’s not worth it. There won’t be time for card games &amp; stuff.....no other date would work so we ended up doing it on Xmas eve with JNmils protests &amp; whining, and it was lovely. The kids found some silly reindeer games on Pinterest &amp; there were prizes and we stayed until 1100pm! 

Well this year our kids decided to no longer do church choir. DH needed to talk to his JNParents about his alcoholic brother &amp; for some reason decided to try &amp; schedule Xmas with them. So extended family Xmas is Saturday before. Xmas with my parents is on Xmas day, same as it’s been for 15+ years, and since the kids aren’t singing, we can spend Xmas eve with them, starting at 3:00 or 4:00 if they want. 

MIL says ‘why not Xmas day?’ 
DH says ‘because we always do Xmas day with RenHens family.’ 
MIL says ‘I know, so this year we should get Xmas day.’ 
DH says ‘uhhhhhh.....or Xmas eve.’
MIL says ‘well find out if RenHens family is doing Xmas day.’
DH ‘uhhh...ok’

Nope. Not happening! I know I’m being a little petty, but my brothers &amp; sisters have arranged Xmas with their in-laws so Xmas day works. Trying to change MY family’s Xmas at this point would be difficult &amp; cause issues with their schedules! 

Plus we spend every holiday with them. 

P.s. additionally JNMIL insists that I bring a dumb veggie tray every year to the big family xmas. I volunteer to bring desserts or fun side dish &amp; every year it’s ‘no, just a veggie tray, but not too big because they never get eaten...’  so I’ve started bringing a veggie tray &amp; something else fun that gets eaten quick. And I purposefully ask someone in front of mil if they liked it....the relatives demand my homemade caramels &amp; beef wrapped pickles. Veggie tray! Ha!

Edit to add TLDR: JNMIL is butthurt that I won’t change 15+ year tradition of Xmas night with my family to spend with her, a tradition that started because we were ‘required’ to spend Xmas eve with the ILs extended family."
213,"Okay so the the title doesn’t really do the story justice so here goes. Also apologies as I’m on mobile. 

I’m currently 33 weeks pregnant, and when I was about 15 weeks I mentioned to my SO about purchasing a dockatot for the baby. I wanted to buy this quite early because if you don’t know, dockatots and the extra covers are expensive for what they are, and we don’t have a whole lot of money so I wanted
to get it out of the way sooner rather than later.  My SO agreed with me and we set aside the money for the dockatot and the extra covers.

A couple of days later he visits his parents and his mom asks him what things we’re going to be purchasing for baby. We already have most big things like the pram and cot so he mentions we’re going to be buying the dockatot next, and she offers to buy it for us as her gift to us. Obviously this is very generous and we were so grateful that she offered, as like I said before they aren’t cheap!

Months pass by and she hasn’t mentioned about buying it again but I kind of just brush it off because maybe she wants to buy it closer to the time, right? Well, my SO visited again today (i didn’t go because I don’t have a good relationship with his parents but that’s a whole other story), and she mentioned that if we didn’t have a high chair she wanted to buy us one. My SO told her that no we don’t have one, but he thought that she was buying us the dockatot. She then tells him that she had thought about it and she thought they were useless, so she wouldn’t be buying us one. 

My SO then explained to her that actually it would be very handy for us, especially for travelling since we’ll be visiting my parents often. He asked if instead of the high chair, would she be able to buy us the dockatot like originally planned. She straight up refused because it seemed like a waste of money to her. 

Am I overreacting for being annoyed at this? Like, yeah, I’d look over it if it was a money problem, but she still wants to buy the high chair, and she recently purchased a stroller for my SIL’s son.  

Usually I wouldn’t be to annoyed about this but we have since spent the money we had set aside for the dockatot on other things like baby monitors and other essentials, so we don’t really have the extra money to go out and spend it on that, especially with it being Christmas just two weeks after baby’s due date! 

Thanks for listening, I guess I just needed to rant!

EDIT: I know about the risk of SIDS with the dockatot, we don’t plan on using it unsupervised, it would just be a real help if baby needs somewhere to sleep while we’re at my parents or other family members houses! With us watching her, of course ☺️"
214,"Hey all,

So my JNMIL has been a thorn in my side for years. Ever since my fiancee gained financial independence from her shes been the nastiest and meanest person I've ever met.

Example: she locked me out from seeing my kids and fiancee on Christmas day after I scrapped together enough money to come home from out west.

Onto the story! She stayed over last night and all seemed well enough, this morning it's like she warped into her usual bitter and hateful self she was on me all morning while we were cleaning up the house and making breakfast about me being to slow and useless, I can handle that and ignore it cause shes actually amazing with our kids.

But then when I didnt respond she started taking stabs at my fiancee who is 2 months post partum.  Has been having severe panic attacks and this struck a nerve and I lost it on her, told her this was our home and she will respect us and will never speak down to either of us like that again or she can show herself out the door.

JNMIL- *Surprised Pikachu face*

Fiancee was horrified as shes never spoke to her mom like that but I wasn't having it anymore after almost 5 years. She left and hasnt contacted us yet but I guess we'll see later tonight when she has time to stew on it.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you DF read through the posts and its given her a lot of encouragement &lt;3 thank you all so much"
215,"JNMIL has been a thorn in my side since I met her. She enabled JNFILs abusive behaviour and alcoholism for years despite it harming my husband and his brother. She’s been consistently hateful to me since I met her (telling my husband that wives come and go, saying she doesn’t believe in second marriages so she won’t help or participate in ours, telling me I’m tearing my husband away from his brother). When my husband and I told her we were expecting, she was happy and talked about how much we’ll be coming up to see her with the baby. Despite the fact that she has no problem driving, and she lives 1.5 hours away from us, she’s made of clear that she expects us to bring the baby to see her, not the other way around. Money is also not a problem for her (she gave my BIL 2k/month for two years because his he kept getting fired from construction jobs, she is constantly remodeling her home and drives a brand new fully loaded SUV). She has made it clear, though, that she will not be buying anything for the baby off our registry, contributing in any way financially or attending a baby shower if we have one. To top it all off, a couple of years ago she disclosed that she thinks JNFIL is at risk of molesting a female child if left alone with one... but now talks about us visiting all the time as if this is no longer an issue.  I honestly do not think she will be a valuable influence in our child’s life and have no plans to bend over backwards to accommodate her demands. Husband disagrees and is making every excuse in the book to justify her entitled behaviour."
216,"Hi, re-introduction incase for the two months you’ve not seen me, hello I’m ImmediateSituation who’s ex-mil is known as This Older Woman or TOW. I have three kids and two of those are TOW’s grandchildren and a lot of shit went down especially after my husband died. The cast here in children are OS - Older Son, DD - Daughter and YS - Younger Son. DD and YS are twins.

Where I left off TOW hadn’t gone back to prison but the restraining order remained in place. Well that b\*\*\*\* figured a way around it.

After 2 week's of peace where my children felt safe enough to go to school, play outside and have fun s\*\*\* hit the fans. My YS started to notice a strange car parked on the opposite side of the road and would you believe it it’s TOW’s flying troll otherwise known as her oldest daughter. From here on I will call her troll because honestly comparing her to a flying monkey is too nice.

I called in my kids who were playing and noticed my flying troll was recording my kids. A quick call to the police and nothing happened. See troll pointed out she wasn’t recording she was on the phone trying to find direction to some shopping mall not even close to where I live. Police let her go after a talk but the warning was not to return.

We all know how this works out, give them an inch they take about 48 miles.

Next day she returned, exact same spot just tried ducking down and recording my kids once again. This time I wasn’t aware straight away until a flying troll starting screaming my DD had “kicked” a ball at her car. I pull in my kids and go through the same routine with the police but again, apparently wasn’t recording.

Oh and for evidence I’m a good mommy I did ask my daughter if she kicked the ball and whilst she admitted it after I pointed out I could check the outdoor camera she’ll “say sorry but doesn’t mean I'm sorry”. Naughty step doesn’t work on my kids but got a lovely washed front door for DD’s punishment.

Back to what happened. Well obviously being caught TOW didn’t send her troll for another 3 days when my camera picked up on her shining a torch through my window and then searching my bins. Exactly three days later on my doorstep was a set of two football nets. Weird as I just threw out my kids last ones because the net became gross and someone would only know that if they had been through my trash.

Now I put too much benefit of the doubt that it was just sister being annoying but after getting a call from school to find out YS was extremely upset I found out troll and TOW had gone to the school and attempted to pass through the fence a note to DD and YS. DD blew it off by refusing to go near her but YS burst into tears.

I’ve now started legal proceedings against Troll in attempts to get a restraining order against her and had to reinform the police that TOW had attempted to break the restraining order once again. I have noticed on my cameras she does drive past the front of my house but is no longer parking where my camera can catch her parking up unfortunately.

Another downside, TOW is no longer living at her registered address and currently no one is willing to give up her location to where she’s living.

Ultimate downside is the fact I’m pretty much back to step one in terms of now YS refusing to go to school afraid TOW is going to be there and pretty afraid to play outside incase sibling is there.

I just really want peace and quiet.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1 - Please guys don't say ""get a lawyer"" I have a lawyer who is trying to get a restraining order place on troll but we've had no luck as we don't currently know where the batshit crazy woman is. 

Secondly - Please don't say ""go to the police"", the police are aware that TOW has ditched where she was living. They are trying to sort it. 

Thirdly - the school cannot do much about it as it's technically not on school property, soon as she sets foot on school grounds they can call the police. My neighbours whilst being helpful either have no CCTV or their CCTV isn't in a good place for footage of the road unfortunately."
217,"My shower is coming up shortly and I'm super excited. My childhood friend from out of town is coming in and staying with us and almost everyone we invited is able to attend. I feel loved that all my queer chosen friends/family made me a priority and are attending. It's at this super cute place that seasonally decorates and serves pastries and its just my style. My mother and I paid for it and set it up as I'm a little bit of a control freak with what has happened with my MIL in the past and realized I need to be my own advocate when it comes to the special times and my experiences. I need to speak up and say no firmly and firstly if I feel uncomfortable at all
 
-now on to my mil because she couldn't not butt in and try to control anything and cause me anxiety with her weird ideas. When she found out I was pregnant she freaked out and tried to take over my future shower by verbally assuming to me and spouse she will throw it at her house. I said no because of her roomate at the time and the neighborhood. It's in the shadiest part of town. Not just the kind of place where people are down on their luck and cant afford to maintain their houses or cars  because hey I totally understand but worse. They steal gas out of your cars with a siphon if you don't have one of those locking gas tanks and animal abuse is rampant. I do not feel safe when I visit and would never go alone or at night or bring my baby over. She wanted my friends and family to arrive and thought it would be fine and everyone would fit and she would get to control things and play host like a lower level weirdo she is. 

-Now the rage for previous idiot things she has said in my first trimester (see other posts) has worn off with my pregnancy brain and she hasn't actually apologized for any of them or trying to force my bodily autonomy into the trash with requiring to be there or wait for me to birth. But my spouse has spoken to her and said she is ruining any chance of a relationship with our child if she continues because it has been shown I will lock shit down. She has continued to slide in baby sitting requests when I mention going to a food place I cant have right now like I would ever leave my child in that house with her unsupervised. Just the thought of her holding my baby for a extended time makes my anxiety shoot through the roof. 

-Shes going to the shower with all my friends. We invited one of hers as this friend has a relationship with us and has been so so so sweet. But my mil asked to throw a second shower... at her house....because her friends and coworkers want to give us things. Noooooow if this was a justyes type sitch I would still have anxiety over strangers but you know older ladies bestowing gifts on a new mom is a lovely idea. But just a fantasy...sooo what exactly is the point and how could it ever be perceived as positive? Because that's how my brain works. Surely my friends are not going to be invited because they just attended one and gave me a gift you CANNOT expect them to attend a 2nd one and its during the holidays who has the time? In my northern culture the only reason you would have a second one is for out of town family if you have a large one who couldn't make it but love you and really want to see you so you have it at your house. NOT surrounded by weird ass strangers who have in the past made snide comments and trying to touch me because a baby belly to them is the fountain of eternal youth. Or attention seekers who ""southern belle"" fan themselves on how terrible their health is and then inhale sugar like it's going out if style or make faces and shoot my efforts down when I mention low impact workout routines and I've actually lost weight in pregnancy and how that can't be healthy. Or why I waited so long to have children. Or why I can't have a shit ton of sugary items or drink a tall glass of orange juice (why yes my Dr. Said no MIL) Or if I explained why full cuts of meat like steak or pork chops make me sick so I won't eat them I just have to be crazy. My mil is OBSESSED with getting protein from meat and has said shes going to chew it up and give it to my baby before I nuclear exploded and shut that shit down. The conclusion I have come to is this is a power play and a way to control something and show off to her friends. Which is completely offensive to me. Just because we waited to have kids unlike your friends who are popping out kids with drug dealers, abusers and absentee fathers does not mean this is your time to shine. 

- I had an anxiety breakdown with sobbing and hyperventilation over it yesterday. Everything she says is super weird and makes me internally recoil so I have said no to 99% of the things that have come out of her mouth. Plus my spouse in his sweet summer child way of thinking was hey free stuff!!! But then realized the gravity if it while I explained crying all the things it tied into and how it made me feel. My hormones are raging and everything makes me cry so I doubted myself and maybe I'm just a bitch? Trying to find hidden Ill intentions in everything and how when we tell her no she is going to say seeeeee I offered to do this nice thing and she rejected me she's such an asshole.

- He is my rock and supports my first inclinations towards things when I get anxious and cloudy headed and supports me. He was like no you're right it is weird. We have no relationship with these people and me at first being excited and then realizing what it's about feels like I'm pimping my wife and unborn child out for presents. I'm giving weird people access to my vulnerable wife for somthing that prob isn't going to be a positive experience. He told me not to doubt myself and that I'm not being a bitch because the whole idea is a power play and super weird. She should be happy to attend the one I set up and that's enough. 
 
-I have no idea what I'm looking for posting this maybe some commiseration or that I'm not weird. Prob support that I'm not alone in this uphill battle."
218,"My fiance and I got similar (not matching/identical but similar) tattoos recently. Mine is on my forearm, about an inch long and an inch wide. My parents don't like my fiance because he has tattoos. That is the sole reason they dislike him.

My brother, knowing we were going to tell them about the engagement, knowing about the tattoo I got, and knowing how important it was that this night went well, loudly asked me about my tattoo at dinner. My parents immediately start guilt tripping me, about how I've broken their hearts and my grandparents are rolling in their graves and whatever else they can think of. I then outed my brother for his ""tramp stamp"" (a lower back tattoo of the male dog from lady and the tramp).

Dinner ends shortly after that and Sister messages me and Brother pretty much scolding us for behaving like children (which is fair tbh) and tells me that she yelled at mum and dad for me, saying that it shouldn't matter and telling them off for being so focused on the tattoo on my forearm that they couldn't see the engagement ring on my finger. So now my parents know I'm engaged, which is fine, although I'd hoped to tell them in happier circumstances.

And then I get a text from my dad.

""OP, we were distraught to hear what you've done to yourself. Your mother and I will pay for laser removal and we expect you to meet us halfway and get it. If you refuse, you can expect to not see us at the wedding. If you intend to keep it then we will need some time to adjust, but we cannot in good conscience watch you walk down the aisle with that on your arm. We hope you will take up our offer. Love,  Dad and Mum""

They sent the same message to my brother, who isn't even seeing anyone right now, threatening to also not come to his wedding if he doesn't remove it. I knew they didn't like tattoos but I never in a million years thought they've have this big of an issue with it."
219,"I got the call! Battlestations tonight, and graduation this Friday! Woo-hoo! DH has begged for a PSL, some nicotine, and a tandem shower upon completion of graduation. I live to serve lol.

Haven't heard hide nor hair of TC. According to DH, she asks about DS and DD. I don't believe it's out of caring, I think it's out of keeping up appearances with DH and I told him as much. He has said he's not going to put up with her BS and he's going to lay down the law. I hope he does.

Oh, and as a side note, he's now graduating in a time period where there's 4 guest passes, not 3. Kill me. I told him that I suspect she will have some snide ass remarks about that and I told him I'm not putting up with it.

So stay tuned, peeps. It's gonna be a wild ride this weekend."
220,"Trigger warning : suicide 

Dh and I went to confront JNMIL about grandbaby rabies. Dh did very well staring the conversation and using us and we statements, I was honestly amazed with JNMIL attempts at manipulation.

Dh made it very clear that it was his turn to talk and if she interrupted or got hystercal we would leave. I think JNMIL knew dh was not Fucking around. So she acted solum, saying 'undertood'.

Afterfeed back was given she went on to say that she was 'surprised' by me because in her family people just love and accept one another for who they Are and this is just who she is.  And that she  guesses she is just not enough for me. 

I couldn't contain it, blurred out clamly, 'I refuse to accept this, this is not who you are this is a behavior, I will not accept your behavior of consistently disrespecting us and our life choices, if who you are is someone whose need for grandbabies is uncontrollable, and cannot respect boundaries, I will not accept it '

She didn't like that and then tried the full arsenal of guilt, saying' I think I am going to move cities as that is what you want ' I replied' nope all we are asking for is to be able to have boundaries in this relationship' she was visibly mad we did not confort her and said 'yes okay well I know that' 

I am not sure what to make of her next comment,  she went on to say 'well I'm thinking I should just get rid of all my stuff and give away all my art and childhood memorabilia, but no one would want it'  she used to work in mental health, so I know she knows that often time people give away precious objects before they commit suicide. I don't know if this was a manipulation technique or what, kind of scary. 

I would be disgusted if she was just saying that as a way of getting comfort. Dh replied, well mom we love you and want to work towards having a relationship where we all feel respected. If we didn't care we wouldn't be here, but this boundary needs to be set. 

Thoughts?! Should I be worried about her??"
221,"Obligatory on mobile warning. I apologize for formatting, grammar and spelling in advanced. All of those things are hard. 

Ok, so my last post discussed a beautiful necklace that my wonderful boyfriend bought for me, and my parents reaction. 
I figured posing that would be a pretty solid way to start the celebration of our engagement, and a good precursor for this post!

The calm before the storm. I promise, there’s a tantrum coming-and I will update you along the way. 

So we went on our yearly weekend trip and my boyfriend decided to propose!!! I love the ring, it’s literally exactly what I want! He even used the jeweler I wanted to make it! What’s more, he wanted to buy diamonds, I didn’t want diamonds. I didn’t get diamonds. I’m over the moon about that as well. But this isn’t about how perfect the proposal was or the ring is it. 

Let’s take a trip back in time. 
Boyfriend and I were visiting my mom, all of us playing on our phones. I had been researching moissanite, and was showing him. Telling him when he proposed I would love that stone. 
A few days later mom had me stop by after work. Demanding to know why I would ask him to use a non-diamond to propose. She asked me, in the quiet, angry voice (the one you heard as a child that said she knows she can’t yell at you because your in public, but you might be killed when get home) “do you think if you want a cheaper ring he’ll propose sooner?” 

I told her I didn’t, that I preferred moissanite for a number of reasons, and listed them off. 
Her-in that happy but trying to sound serious voice (you know, the one where they are trying to sound not happy delivering bad news) “I just don’t understand why you would devalue yourself with a ring that’s not diamond.”
I explained again how it’s not devaluing me, how the stone is more romantic than a diamond, plus it’s ethically sound and has that extra fire diamonds just don’t have. 
She still couldn’t understand, but let me know I had better make sure he gets a diamond. 
As time passed every once in a while she would remind me “Don’t let him get you any of that cubic zirconia bull shit, you are worth more and he makes the money.” In a voice that almost sounded like she was scolding me. I’m pretty sure she said this because she couldn’t remeber the name of the stone I actually wanted. So I would take the easy route and promise her I wouldn’t let him get me any of that cubic zirconia bullshit (nothing against cubic zirconia, it’s beautiful in its own right, and can be replaced affordably if need be-but agreeing was just easier). 

Well now we’re engaged.
I sent the picture (this is all via text) and she reminded me to get the warranty because evidently ‘I’m heck on rings’ (I’ve actually always took really good care of my jewelry. She also mentioned “Diamonds are pretty hardy but settings need looked after.” 
Now I know damned well she knows these aren’t diamonds but whatever, BEC. 

She also mentioned “it’s pretty.”
Well I made the mistake of sending her the video that the jeweler sent him. The video includes the wedding bands that go with the ring-yes, I have two bands. Yes he spoils me. Yes I am beyond grateful for him.  
Her-“pretty.”
Me-“I know, I love it”
Her-“That’s like XXXXX size reddithostage”
Me-“Mom it’s exactly what I wanted-made exactly who I wanted it through”
Her-“Is it three separate pieces?”
Me-“yeah”
Her-“pretty”


My friends all know what I wanted and they have all told me how beautiful the photo I’ve sent them is. To be fair the photo does it no justice what so ever. Strangers while we’ve been gone have seen my ring and told me how beautiful it is. She’s the only person who said it was pretty. And with the period. She’s one of those that when she uses periods, or emoji’s-it’s usually always her being bitchy. I pretend to ignore them now.  

She’s also sent ideas for engagement photos, and already beginning to make comments on my hair color. Granted my hair color isn’t appropriate for a wedding, and change it back for weddings and other formal events. But jokes on her, she decided she was going to get her way a long time ago with the hair color I would wear by telling me that I look exactly like a huge justno AIL when she was my age (she had a different hair color, for her entire life then what I rock). I will never forget her voice when she said that, the smug satisfaction. 
I smiled “well AIL must have looked very pretty when she was my age, and I appreciate the compliment.”
She started to try to tell me it wasn’t a compliment, but stopped herself and changed it to “I thought you would like hearing that.”
Me-“I do, it was nice. Especially since you aren’t comparing my personality to her like you did last time you were upset about a decision I made.”
Cue CBF
I walked out of her house feeling incredibly proud. I’ll probably make another post talking about all of the drama over MY hair throughout the years. 

Oh and when all was said and done she sent me one of those “a daughter is a Mom’s best friend” inspirational looking photos. 
Funny, my best friends didn’t have anything remotely negative to say. 
-I know to read this it doesn’t seem like anything negative was said, but her use of punctuation and bringing up a price point-all signs and symptoms of an impending tantrum. I’ll share that with you when it hits. But it may take a few weeks to a month or two. Just depends on the next time I’m stressed about something. 

To be completely fair-I get her concerns. I have no idea the amount of PTSD she has to deal with because of my former relationships, and how I was treated by those ex’s (sarcastically stated).

I appreciate you for reading. And apologize for the excessive rambling, I may be really tired and a bit buzzed."
222,"I’ve been lurking on this sub and finally thought it would be good to share the craziness that is my MIL and the events that led me to going NC with her. 

I’m going to call MIL, MuuMuuQueen, because all she wears is black muumuus-grocery shopping? Casual muuumuu. Wedding? Slightly nicer muumuu with sparkly sweater, but I digress. 

DH and I started dating in high school and I knew MMQ was “off,” controlling, like to yell a lot and emotionally distant from her children. But the wedding really brought out the crazy. She wanted a daughter and got all boys, so she decided I would be her surrogate daughter. 

MMQ bought decorations without asking us (we didn’t use them), tried to get me to wear her wedding dress (luckily too small) and veil(moth eaten), as well as choose a tiara from her collection (I thought she was kidding-she wasn’t). All of these things we sidestepped. 

Her final act was to invite 15 people without asking us. Including her boyfriends mother, who my husband and I had only met twice. She proceeded to call this woman my DH’s “grandmother,” and how could I exclude his “grandmother?” We had a very small venue, and we simply couldn’t fit anyone else inside. Add to that she wasn’t paying for a single thing in this wedding. DH and I went to her house to calmly tell her that these people could not come. MMQ cajoled, then cried. When that didn’t work she started screaming. She said, “well, it will be really embarrassing for you to have to uninvite those people,” to which I responded, “no, it’s going to be embarrassing for YOU.” She didn’t like that and pulled the, “well, I’m not coming then!” I told her that she is an adult and while it would be unfortunate if she chose not to come to her son’s wedding, that is her choice to make. She didn’t like that, so she contacted my mother to tell on me 😂 Little did she know that my mother is a badass and does not put up with anyone’s nonsense. Of course, my mother also swatted her down. She did eventually come to the wedding but refused to talk to me, flat out ignored me on my own wedding day. At the end of the night she tried to sneak out the back without saying goodbye to my husband-he caught her. 

She still refuses to this day 5 years later to acknowledge my presence if we are in the same room together, even if I’m required to speak directly to her. I’ve seen her a handful of times at family events, otherwise we are NC. DH is VLC with her. Life is nicer and quieter."
223,"I tagged this ""advice wanted"" because I'm curious how other people would react if their Boyfriend of 1.5 years mother did something like this. 

I don't know how JN I consider this because while she kept it secrete she did have ""good"" intentions when it came to my DD. When it comes to money I have accepted she will never stop trying to prevent me from having what she considers ""her family's"" money even if I marry my Fdh. I guess I'm just happy enough that my DD who Fmil met at age 5 has become ""her family"" even if I stay on the outside. 

I was asleep because I had just worked the night shift. Fdh brought my DD to school and went to work. I hear the door bell ringing and ringing, so I spend 10 minutes in bed hoping they leave but they didn't. The last time this happened it was the police trying to serve Fmil an arrest warrant at Fdh's house because she pistol whipped one of her employees. I finally go answer the door and to my amazement it's not the police but a DHL delivery driver. He hands me a large envelope addressed to my DD and has me sign for it. I'm slightly confused but I take it and open it.

Inside was a paper from a certain small technology advanced European government stating that the owner of the residence had overpaid in property taxes, it listed the 3 owners of the property (DD, Fdh's niece, and a company Fmil owns) it had DDs name underlined. On the empty page was a check (the payroll style check) that had DDs name in the amount of €920. The paper also stated that if DD would come to a government office and register her bank account number she would receive all future rebates electronically. 

Only one problem. My child was 6 years old and can't possibly have went out and bought a house without me knowing about it. Not even 1/3rd of a house like the paper stated. I'd have assumed it was a scam and the check would bounce EXCEPT I knew my Fmil was a resident of this country and had lived there for 7 years when Fdh was a child. 

One would think that a country that lets people vote and pay taxes online would make people buying a house show some kind of identification right?  Nope. FMIL managed to buy an apartment in DDs name with a photo copy of her passport. Why did Fmil have a copy of DDs passport? It's an actual innocent reason, Because she needed it to get a visa for DD to visit her home country with Fdh and I. That country required I have my ex husband's permission for DD to enter and he wasn't giving it. But as Fmil served high up in government she told me she would handle the problem before our trip. 
I mean she handled the problem and I even got an extra non threatening surprise so I call that a win with Fmil. 

When Fdh got home he called his mother and she admitted it after asking how he knew. Her reasoning? Well I don't want Op to know. As op's DD is my grandchild (she dictated that DD was her grandchild on my 3rd date with Fdh) I want to secure her future financially. Op might marry and divorce you. That would cost you money and take away money from DD.  (I'm sure she said more but this is all Fdh will admit she said) 

She wasn't angry, she didn't deny it. She just matter of fact stated that she did it and she'll do it if she wants because she didn't want me knowing about it. I wasn't even angry, I was so surprised she told the truth and surprised thay she wasn't using my DD to hide her money from the courts. Due to my shock I didn't even yell at Fmil, mostly because I was amazed she told the truth but also slightly scared of her at the time. I've since figured out that she probably won't harm me untill my DD is any adult so I do speak my mind more with her and tell her when she's being a JN. 

Fdh and I have a rule now, whatever Fmil wants to do for DD regarding money/investments/etc she can do. But she has to tell him before she does it. Fdh and I agreed he'd keep it a secrete from me because I don't really care but it prevents surprises again. 

Fmil did set up all the refund checks to be deposited into DDs College fund. 

I considered this a partial win at the time because DD gets a safety net when she's older."
224,"**EDIT** 

**She didn’t reply to the message but late last night, she drove round and asked me to sit in the car with her. My SO stood outside the car ready to jump in if he saw her shouting at me. She apologised and said she shouldn’t have said the things she has and has agreed to counselling with me so I can understand why and where those thoughts came from. Until then, she’s not going to be involved in baby or sons life.** 



I originally posted in AITA and was told to come here for some good support and advice so posting in here if that’s okay? 


I’ll try to keep this as short as poss. 
 
I (29F) have a 7 yr old who was born with an auto immune disease.. we had no idea what he had and he went undiagnosed for 6 months with painful procedures happening to find out. When we did find out, he had a Bone Marrow Transplant at 1yr old and he was then cured. It was a difficult time, sure but at the end we got a beautiful boy that is now happy, healthy and enjoying life. 

I’m pregnant with my second, I have fertility issues and we didn’t think it was possible to have a second but it did. 

There is a 50/50 chance that this child has the same illness. My partner &amp; I are obviously terrified and I’m having all the tests to find out whether they have it or not. It won’t affect our decision to keep the child but it will help us and the doctors prepare for their delivery. 

My mother hates that I have decided to keep the child and has called me cruel, selfish and mean for putting my child through this as well as everyone else in the family. Today she asked to meet me in the park for a walk. I thought she was ready to apologise for the hurtful things she’s been saying (one of which is that she’d abort my 7 yr old given the chance all over again.) 

I was wrong. She stood in the park screaming at me saying how cruel I am, how I’m selfish for putting her through this and for being an awful mother to both children. 

I am a full time worker, as is my partner. My kid is joined to all sorts of extra curricular activities, he never goes without love, food or clothes. I don’t rely on my mother for anything. All I wanted was her love and support. 

Ive just sent her this message. So my question is.. Should I be cutting her off here? I’ve tried 3 times now to fix this and meet her for a ‘chat.’ 

Here’s the message I sent: 


**I’m done. I can’t believe the hurtful words coming out of your mouth and the selfishness that you’re expressing. You’re right. You’re not the mother I need right now. I honestly don’t even think you deserve a text explaining why I won’t be talking or engaging with you from here on out, but unlike you - I’ve developed compassion somewhere along the way. You have hurt and disappointed me beyond anything I ever thought you were capable of. You are being cruel and heartless. You might be doing what you’re doing out of fear and love but it’s presenting as hateful, painful and awful words and actions which quite frankly, is just mind boggling that you can’t see. I can assure you that I will NEVER hurt my children the way you have and although they might have to have a few painful procedures in their lifetime, they will have unconditional love and SUPPORT from their mother. Thank you for showing me how it’s not done.**"

First time poster here! Long read ahead. 

Some background: 
My entire life has always been just my mum and I. She’s a single mum and has never been married. We’ve got a huge extended family, but it’s mostly just been me and her. Growing up, my mother gave me tonnes of opportunities and supported everything I wanted to do (sports, drama, studies) whether financially, mentally or emotionally. 

But most times, she’d have really inappropriately intense outbursts for really small things. She would (and still does) call me all sorts of names and continuously remind me that I’d be nothing without her, and that she’d sacrificed her potential and wasted all her time/effort/money on me. She usually then tells any family/friends who will listen and complain about me. I was probably a slight handful growing up (teenager with strict parent trying to push boundaries), but I don’t think I was outright horrible. Lol

It wasn’t all bad though. We would have extended periods of time where we have a “good” relationship, and spend time talking and doing things together. I think over time, I learnt to Grey Rock magnificently because she was the one person that I had to depend on for shelter, support and love. The manic switches between her being extremely affectionate one day, and verbally/emotionally abusive another, lead me to some really horrible romantic relationships where I thought that was “love”. But that’s a whole other story for another time. 

Flash forward to current times: 

My mother initially loved FH, and encouraged us being together. He’s always been a sweetheart to her, with nothing bad to say about her. Because of my upbringing, he’s always understood that I would have to take care of my mother when we’re older, and he’s always been game. A short while into our relationship, she suggested we set a date for a wedding. We’d planned on getting married anyway, so we set it for a few years down the line. (She then went around telling people that she suggested marriage/proposed to him).

Things were going fine until recently. I don’t know if she has become overly familiar with him and is just trying her usual antics on him. There was a small misunderstanding about some wedding details, in which FH and I overreacted slightly, and unfortunately, my mum caught a whiff of it and went ballistic. She stewed in her emotions for a couple of weeks and waiting till he came over to the house to “clarify things”, then laid it all on him. 

She said his parents were disrespectful and ashamed of the fact that she was a single mother (they have never uttered a single horrible word about her). At one point, called future FIL’s face f*ckedup because he had turned up to a breakfast with her, with a tired face after arriving home from the airport at 3am the night before. She also flat out said that she doesn’t trust his family (they have never given her any reason not to) and that she regrets letting me marry him. She’s also called his parents horrible and questioned their parenting techniques, said they are “beneath our class” amongst a lot of stupid untrue unreasonable shit.  

All the time, I sat next to FH, a Grey Rock, while he sat there shaking and controlling himself. I can’t help but feel responsible for the whole shenanigan. I think a lot of her reaction stems from fear that I will be “abandoning” her after I get married, but I don’t know how to justify the fact that she said all those things to him. She’s been saying a lot of shit about him for weeks, but I think I’ve gotten used to it and just excused it as another one of her outbursts. 

FH is heartbroken and doesn’t know how to face her anymore. Watching her just say all those vile things to him made me realise that my mother is a grade A narcissist with a lot of malice and no remorse for saying shitty things. I called her out for calling FIL a f*ckface and her response was “oh really? I think I say f*ck so much that it’s just another word to me”. Lol

FH understands that I am expected to take care of my mother as she ages, and he is still trying to process all the really horrible things that were said. I don’t know how else to help him or protect him from her further down the line, except to keep her at a “comfortable” distance. This whole thing sucks cos all 3 of us had such a friendly happy relationship, but it’s all gone to shit now. 

Am I wrong to think my mother is a narcissist? Maybe she’s just an overly sensitive and insecure person? 😔"
226,"Tame story for this subreddit, but just needed to get this off my chest. I have worse ones archived in my brain if you guys are interested. Nicknaming FMIL “FFS FMIL” in the post title to distinguish her a bit without spending too much creative energy naming her. 

Let me set the stage: I am Asian, and have been with my fiancé for the better part of a decade. My fiancé and his family are white (big can of worms I’m not going open here; suffice to say FMIL openly states that as a privileged, educated person, the right thing to be is “colorblind” and that she doesn’t consider my race to be any different from her own - literally). I also work for Fiancé’s family business. I love my coworkers and it’s decent pay, so I’m reluctant to leave, despite knowing it’s going to blow up in my face one day.

I have anxiety and get panic attacks that I have a hard time managing. She knows that I get anxious about certain things, but has always responded with pseudo-sympathetic advice like “Have you tried Xanax?” even though I’ve made it clear that medication is not for me, so obviously I don’t confide in her.

Had a bad panic attack a few hours before the dinner after a long and stressful week at work, so I sent her a polite and friendly text opting out, blaming my own poor scheduling and promising to make it up to her. Also made a point to say that fiancé was still attending (he dislikes her too, tbh, but doesn’t want to engage her in battle unless necessary since she fights ugly) and that I hope they have a good time.

Got a short “OK” in response, then radio silence. I’m perfectly fine with that. Fiancé comes home after the dinner, says FMIL was in a shitty mood all evening but she’d had a bad day overall, so we don’t read too much into it.

She calls him a few days later. His phone is loud so I hear their entire conversation. She says that she “felt personally affronted” that I chose not to attend dinner, and that she “doesn’t know what [I] want from her.” Claimed that I always skip out on her family events (tbf, we do have a bit of a history of declining her invites, but we live in the same town and have visited them at least twice since August; we’re scheduled to attend a wedding with them next month; and we usually spend at least two major holidays with them, not to mention that I WORK FOR THE FAMILY COMPANY, FFS, so she sees me every day) and that I “never prioritize [her] family even though [I am] marrying into it and need to learn to integrate.” 

Then she goes on to tell him that he also wasn’t as “engaged” during dinner as she wanted him to be, and blamed me for distracting him by not being there. 

I don’t even know where to begin. Some days she can be outgoing, witty, and fun; some days, I’m genuinely startled by how much I hate her, despite striving to be as pleasant and friendly to her as I can be. She brings out the worst in me, and I despise myself for it. 

I told Fiancé he should tell her that if the current arrangement of generous visits isn’t working out, I’m happy to attend their family events only during major holidays from here on out. Anything to save her from the devastating PERSONAL INSULT I inflicted on her by my no-show this time. FFS, FMIL.

TL;DR: FMIL doesn’t take my anxiety seriously and complains to Fiancé about me being a flake. Wants to know what I want from her. Obviously, I want her to fuck off, but since this isn’t a perfect world, I can’t say that to her without losing my job and starting WWIII.

Like I mentioned before, I have more stories, including the time she tried to find out what my engagement ring looks like before Fiancé even proposed, and all of the awful things she’s openly said in public (to customer service, about other people in our field of work, etc). Just let me know if you guys want them. Thanks for reading.

Edit: a few typos."
227,"I'll try and keep it short, I really just want to rant.

As some may have read before, Heartburn is my FMIL. She's really ramping up the guilty shit with DFH lately and its getting on my last nerve. She wants all of his spare time now despite him already giving her more time than he can afford at the minute. He's working away an awful lot this month and into next and she just doesn't seem to get it. 

He recently added her on The Book of Faces again after a year or so of her losing privileges. (She accused him of hitting me because she walked in on an argument we had, she pitched a fit so bad that she made him cry. He ended up living in a hotel for a month. I have not and absolutely refuse to forgive her for that one.) He added her because he felt like he wasn't making enough of an effort. I don't particularly care, it's his account, he can please himself. 

She instantly went to my profile and started liking everything. This got her blocked and enforced my boundary; you still don't have those privileges with me. You lost the right to see our photos, our outings and anything we do together from me. If DFH chooses to post, that's up to him, but most photos and posts come from me. 

We went out on Saturday. DFH put this on his profile, checked in. She liked it. She knew we were out on DATE NIGHT. And she still tried to call. And then had the gall last night to ask if we actually went out when she knew full fucking well that we did. She then pitched a fit over DFH being away again despite already knowing that too.

And then there is my mother. Who doesn't like me seeing my dad. They're still married. But she hates me speaking to and seeing my dad. He works away most of the year and if she can't see him then fucking definitely no one else can. But I saw him at the weekend because I knew where he'd be. I'm not sure she knows yet but when she does, it's going to be insufferable. Especially since he got to sit down and finally talk to my DFH who my mother despises for some unknown reason.

I have zero support network this week too. All my friends have gone on holiday and DFH is away again. I'm left with my mother and HeartBurn.

I must've really pissed someone off in a previous life."
228,"Hello again y'all. I usually like to preface these stories with a little statement questioning the status of my Stepmom as maybe JN, maybe BEC. But, nah, today is not the day for one of those stories. This all happened in the past, so no advice is needed. But perhaps some backstory.

I was the Golden Child.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very young when Dad and SM got together. I don't really remember a time when they weren't married. All I knew was that I grew up and into consciousness calling her ""Mom,"" and since she didn't have children of her own, I guess she really loved that.

My brother was the Scapegoat.

He is older than me by a couple of years, and by the time they were married he was already a self-aware little butthead. He takes after our mom in that he is very much JN. There is no asterisk at the top of those stories. There's no ""well maybe its ME."" It's him. Brother and SM hated each other. Openly.

Mom and Brother hated that I called SM ""Mom."" It's understandable why because of their history, but those stories will be later. Every time the name would escape my lips, he would scoff. He would yell at me. He would tell me I'm killing my mother by breaking her heart. But SM loved it! And I knew no better. Eventually I did though, and I grew out of it.

Oh, but growing out of it had its own consequences. I hadn't realized it at first, but every time I used her Name instead of Mom, it was like playing a game of ""don't break the ice,"" and I was a kindergartner with a hammer.

What does her Name, my Brother, my GC status, and shopping have to do with each other? Well, all of these facts together are what made this story come to be.

I wasn't spoiled, by any means. But, SM would say no to me far less frequently than she did to Brother. Sometimes she would say Yes to me getting a book, but No to Brother asking for a ball. It seemed unequal and unfair, but as a selfish child, I had no idea that it was intentional. I don't remember why we went, but SM brought Brother and me to K-Mart late in the evening. We walked around the toys and my Stepmom would lift up sporty things and ask my Brother, ""do you want this?"" And my brother, hating her, would say no. I think he knew more than I did at that point. ""You don't want this?"" She would offer something else up to him. ""No.""

Now, again, as a selfish child, I saw that he was being offered presents, and he wasn't taking proper advantage of the situation! I could, though! I knew exactly what I wanted. I pulled something off the shelf. ""Can I have this, Name?"" The look she gave me that night was something I had never seen before. We call it a CBF these days, but at the time it was completely foreign to me. ""NO, you put that away now."" Was her response.

Okay, maybe toys weren't what she was trying to offer my brother. I should try to find something more... academic! So while she was asking him if he would like x, or y, and him declining everything, I went and picked up a book. ""Can I have this book, Name?"" Again. She flashed around and glared at me. ""NO. You have TOO MANY THINGS."" I was hurt. I didn't understand. Why were we in K-Mart at night? Why was she offering my brother anything he could want, and he was declining everything? Why wouldn't she even get me a book? She'd empty her bank account to buy little me books! I didn't understand, and as a selfish little girl, I did the only thing I knew how to do when faced with such brazen inequality. I pouted.

I pouted in line as we left. I pouted in the car on the way home. SM hated the pouting, understandably. She barked at me, ""well what's wrong with YOU?"" And my brother, for probably the only time in his life, stood up for me. ""You kept trying to buy me toys and kept saying no to what she wanted!""

SM drives as she says, ""well, I buy her far too many things. She is spoiled. And since I am not her Mom anymore, I wanted to get you some things too!""

""You weren't being fair!"" Good point, big brother. I kept pouting. I didn't make a peep the whole way home. For some reason I knew I was being punished, but little me didn't have the capacity to understand why. I know that the reason we went to K-Mart was not to do some late night shopping. It was to make a point. I was not the Golden Child when I called her Name. I was the Golden Child when I pleased her. And she could torture selfish little me by trying to spoil my brother. She could switch the roles at any time. And I had better. Call. Her. Mom.

We got home and she decided to put me in time out for pouting, but not before she sat across from me and CBFed at me in silence while I pouted. ""Why are you angry?!"" She shouted. I echoed my brother, ""you weren't being fair.""

""Fair? You have too many things! I wanted to get your brother something NICE."" But why did I have to be there for it?

Big Me understands that Little Me's attitude was not good. I should not have expected toys or felt betrayed by the lack of toys. Honestly I don't even remember what I picked up besides the book. But, Big Me also understands what Brother knew at the time. She was not taking us late night shopping for any other reason than to make a show of getting him a big present, and telling me no when I asked for something. Big Me understands that Brother was good. She was expecting us to be mad at each other, but for once he had my back. But he's for another Subreddit in another time."
229,"Although we live fairly close (about 3 hours drive), we rarely visit DH's parents. This is by his choice. We do visit on Christmas or Thanksgiving, and once or twice throughout the year. The reasons we don't visit more are:

1) We weren't allowed to sleep in the same bedroom until we were married, even though we lived together and are both adults.
2) DH usually has to work at least part of most holidays, so visiting means six + hours of driving for a one or two day visit.
3) DH and parents have some unresolved issues from his upbringing that cause him a ton of anxiety.
4) JNMIL makes constant snide comments about FIL.

I'm hoping for some advice about how to handle issue # 4.

JNMIL loves to tell stories about how life was when they were first married and when the kids were young. Many of these stories are peppered with passive aggressive comments to FIL. For example, on describing how tight money was when the kids were young, JNMIL will turn to FIL, and with the cruelest look on her face say things like ""why we ever decided to let YOU be the bread winner is beyond me."" I know that these comments aren't anywhere near as bad as some of the things described on this thread, but they break my heart. FIL is just the sweetest little old man. He'd never say a mean word to anyone and loves his wife and kids to death.

I'm uncomfortable with these kinds of jokes, but don't think it's my place to say anything. DH and the other kids have told JNMIL to stop it, so she just needles FIL when her kids aren't around but she has an audience of in-laws.

Beyond refusing to acknowledge comments like this, is there anything else you guys could suggest for me to do, so that she stops viewing me as a willing audience member?"
230,"My baby is 5 months old. She turns 6 months in a few days. Primarily breastfed and my pediatrician doesn’t recommend  starting food until 6 months...but my baby was clearly ready so I decided to try solids two weeks ago. My MIL immediately started telling me what to do. 

I told her from the very beginning, “we are doing some veggies right now and trying a new food every 3 days. I’m not mixing foods together because if she has an allergic reaction, I need to know what food is causing it. I’ll do the fruits last because they’re sweet and I don’t want her to dislike vegetables because she wants the sweet stuff. And after we’ve tried everything THEN I will start mixing.”

The next day, MIL texts me, “you need to give her bananas.” 

The following day she comments on my Facebook post about starting solids with baby, “you need to feed her organic only and mush up ripe banana. Make your own baby food much cheaper” (Mind you, I posted a picture of my baby in her high chair and the box of ORGANIC RICE CEREAL is in the shot)

The next day she texts me “grind up apples and bananas and give it to her.” And links me two articles about starting a baby on solid food. 

A few days later she calls me and asks what food baby has been given, I tell her, and she asks what food I’m going to try next. Then offers, “what about banana?”

Mind you, I told her I was giving baby new foods every THREE DAYS. Do you know how many times I’ve said the words “butternut squash” in the last week? Up until a week ago I personally never ate that food in my life and suddenly I’m saying “She only really likes butternut squash so far but in 3 days we’ll try something new” every other day.

She’s calling my fiancé and telling him how we need to feed her bananas and grind them up and try broccoli too.

This morning, she texts me that I need to give her avocado and eggs for her brain development. 

I’m SO annoyed. Do I sound like I don’t know what I’m doing? Did I not lay out my plan in the very beginning? She started pushing back against what I’m feeding my daughter literally 12 hours after we spoke. I’m already uncomfortable as it is going against the pediatrician’s advice (I’m a first time mom) so if she could just shut the fuck up, that’d be great.

Edit: New info. She came over tonight for dinner and brought one sweet potato and one avocado and told me to try them with her. I’m so over it."
231,"TRIGGER WARNING: Talk about drug addiction, death, overdose.

Today would have been my exes 30th birthday. He died 4.5 years ago from a heroin overdose. At the time our daughter was 2. I don’t dwell on his death. It’s not something that upsets me. He made his choices and they got him where he is and he is the only one responsible for that. He was never really around for my daughter and I dealt with his addiction for years. To be honest, his death was a relief. I didn’t have to stress about him. Or continue the custody battle. I made my peace with it a long time ago and moved on. I’ve since married.

My Ex-MIL has not moved forward in anyway. Fair enough because she lost a child. But she is in serious denial about his addictions. And truly believes that his death was unfair and untimely. She believes he could have been “saved” and “cured” from his addictions. I never thought this was true. I believe he was always going to die from it. He went to so many rehabs and never came out any different. He lie, stole, got arrested etc. 

Today, she tagged myself and myself only in a book of faces post about his birthday with half a dozen photos of him and I and our daughter. She did not tag any other family members. It doesn’t bother my husband when she does these things but it annoys the crap out of me. I’m not someone who airs my drama/life stories on social media for the world to see. I was very private in my grief back then. And I find it very inappropriate that she would do this for husband and in-laws to see.

EDIT 1: I should say that my daughter and I do have contact with my Ex-MIL and Ex-FIL but it’s very infrequent, maybe once a month. I am always present for the visits. She has not said anything negative to my daughter."
232," 

Good day people of this sub, yesterday I posted about my cousin (I  have to learn how to put up links..) I am putting up some warnings for  triggers? I read you have to do that, which is good ofc, you need to be  attentive to others when dealing with triggers. Uhm, the triggers are  domestic violence, mutilation and rape? Is that good or do I have to say  just triggers?   


Ok.. My Ex-MIL recently  came back into my life because she got arrested for various crimes which is not surprising.. But it brings so much negative energy into my life it makes me want to drop kick her of the 14th floor. I am 32 now and  married to my lovely husband (33),  his family is amazing and welcoming (though he has a step-sister who is  justno, very.. I don't want to call a woman crazy because how often  they're called crazy when they speak their mind or show emotion so don't want to be that type of man) with  amazing brothers and another step-sister, the kind one who doesn't act like a narc,  or three triads I read about here. My husband has been supportive through all  this and knows about everything, this is all about my ex and ex-mil.   


When  I was younger, more than 10 years ago I was dating a guy from the same background, family knew each other, were friends, went to the same church and temple (yeah jews and xtians living together) all was good and happy in the land of Santos, but then everything changed when my ex turned into a nightmare. Things were sometimes off but back then I  was very naive and trusting, taking things to heart and trying to fix  everything because I loved helping people (reason why I went into  medicine) and making sure everyone was doing well. First came the  threats ""If you go on a walk with that female friend you're unfaithful!!"", well.. I responded with ""We're gay, she hetero, what am I  going to do with her?"", he was ""appeased"" and would be quiet. Then he would get upset if I would talk with colleagues after work, just  chilling and having a good time. Or when I was walking the dog, I don't  know for other people but I loved going on long walks, listening to music, just unwinding and relaxing, he wanted to come with me to make sure nothing happened. 

At first I thought it was cute I did live in a bad  part of town but I never had problems there. Then one night he was  talking to himself becoming more and more.. I don't know how to describe  it but afterwards I heard it was a schizophrenic episode and he was  talking to beings that fed his paranoia, it was fucking scary and I am thankful I don't remember much. He grabbed a statue (decorative kind) and hit me on the  back of my head, I woke up out of it with a terrible headache and feeling like I was drugged, which he had done, he had spiked my drink  before he knocked me out. He was raping me and I felt intense pain on my  back (I was on my stomach) where he had carved things with a kitchen  knife to make sure I was marked as his. When he passed out I managed to  get to the hospital I was lucky he lived right across from the hospital.  They called my mother and they told her I was attacked and in the ER,  she came right away, she was the MVP of that day. I told her what  happened, bawling, being a mess, screaming cuz I still felt the effects of the medicine but they were wearing off and the pain  came back to kick me in the ass.   


Afterwards  my mother told me I was at his house for over 15 hours where he did who knows  what with me for that amount of time, I had texted my mom when I arrived. The police came questioned me etc you all know how that  goes. His mother came and begged us not to press charges that her child  was sick and needed help. My mother wasn't really happy with that option  and told her that, she also told my mil that she would grab a chair and ram  it through her chest. His mother kept coming at me and kept calling, stalking me and more which made me feel pressured to keep it between us.  What would the church and temple think of a gay bringing that attention  to them after they accepted me and my satanic ways. She called me the  whore of satan which would be better than my relationship with her son +  I would actually get paid money and not have a freeloader around, but  alas, I was young and naive, did not want to cause trouble in two  communities + the entire hispanic and latino community would be all  getting off on the drama and gossip. So I kept quiet for 8 years.   


He  would eventually be admitted into a clinic for his issues and all was  good, ignored him for eight years, went on with my life. But  you all know what that does to a person, PTSD went untreated, developed a  stress and anxiety disorder but I finished medical school, got my  doctorate and everything so woot bitches! I was so tenacious I got shit done, spite is one hell of a motivator. His mother would keep pestering  me at church, temple, cook outs and every social event. I would need to  forgive her child because he did not know what he did, he's sick and  would I be so evil to someone with cancer? Again, I was naive and would  let her talk like that when we were together because I did not want to  cause any drama. She would say things like ""if you talk to my child's  psychiatrist he could go home, it is your fault he's locked away, my  baby!!! BEBEEEEE"". I never understood why she would call her 26 yr old a  baby but.. now I know MILS and Jocasta and all those fun terms, yeah  for me!   


Then he  was released for good behaviour because he was a good person on meds. All was good till he got a new boyfriend, went off his meds, raped him too. The guy reached out to me and we shared similar stories. He also had problem with the mil from hell when he would not do as she said or wanted, he was atheist and that meant the Devil's Seed made him turn  her child against him. Lovely how she has such a clear connection with  Satan she must have him on whatsapp or something. He did press charges,  he did go forward with everything and well he made me more courageous to come out with everything that happened with EX and EX-MIL.  During that time I was in a car accident, it was bad, I was in a coma (I saw  it as an extended vacation from work and life) and I went into therapy.  Weellllllllllll therapy made me realize life was fucked and I not only  had childhood trauma but traumas surrounding my ex and his mother. They  said I had PTSD, Anxiety and Stress Disorder and I would need more  therapy, EMDR, all the works. Was.. needed? I learned so much and became  such a better person because I learned to think for myself and think  about my own needs and wants in life. It made me open for love and  relationships and I met my husband and I married him. Thank you therapy  for making me love myself. Of course, this is JustnoMIL and my EX-MIL  remained intrusive and rude, but I would tell her off now, she did  not like this and would spread lies about me. I did not mind that much because I knew people knew me and would ask me before believing her stories. I am not much of a catholic or jew to be honest, my family is and I love my family so I support them. They love me for me and the cook outs are BOMB and fun, it also allows me to see how apple pie and empanadas make these religious women go utterly mental.   


Well  this has become very long already, sorry for this! But if you're still  reading here are somethings my ex-mil did with her son and on her own.  She would help him with his meds they discovered he had schizophrenia  and other things when he was 15? or 14? Do not remember exactly so sorry  for that. She spun her web of lies and used her evil powers of  persuasion so that she could administer the medicine. When he began to  get serious with me she would lower the dosage and whisper things in his  ear how I was going out with others, having fun with others, I must  have been cheating. All sorts of things to push him towards the deep  end. She did the same with the guy after me, she had to be in control  and the most important person in his life. He was gay and she accepted  it but she would be the only woman who would be important to him.   
She  never liked how my mother was with him how she supported is wishes to  continue school and have his own life, + my mother was not ""really"" part  of the community cuz she was not Hispanic but my mother was beloved by  the community and her empanadas weren't dry af like hers. She wasn't so  obsessed with  her youngest because he wasn't the oldest. She would  always say how fit he was, how virile, how masculine, it was quite..  weird? She never did it in public but when alone she would say things  like that.   


Well,  couple of months ago I got a call from her youngest, he asked if I  would come forward and help with the case against his mother. I was  shook! I did not expect this but I had to discuss with my husband and  family, I agreed to it in the end. Well.. She was arrested because she  tried to climb to the fourth floor where her youngest lived with his gf  because he did not call her back. She also tried to give his gf poisoned  food, she is deadly allergic to mushrooms and a mild allergy for some  other things and she just.. used it all, she thought the mushrooms would  be hidden with the other veggies. Tried to harm her by arranging a hike  during a heatwave, poor girl is a red head with morticia addams skin.  Well she did more things but.. it has been long enough lol.. In court  it was revealed that my ex had refused her visitation since his new  med regime was giving him much needed clarity. He told the medical staff his  mother raped him as a teen and young adult. She tried to get pregnant  with his baby but it never worked out, she denied it first in court but  they had footage of her doing it because of the nanny cam he had placed  in the room. Now we're in the middle of court and it has been so  tiresome and.. long. Every time some new information is added to the  case it seems more disgusting things come to the surface. I will post  more about her and the things she has done, it has been enough for  today.   


I only  wanted to ask if any of you have advice how to go forward? I want to  ignore everything but I also want to read everything about the case. I want to speak up  and let it be done but I also want to support her youngest, still feel  for that kid I saw as a brother. It doesn't help he's close friends with  my youngest cousin and I see him all the time with bdays (lots of  family members here) and events.   


Thank you everyone who took the time to read all of this! Also english is not my native language so please be educational when correcting me XD"
233,"Someone else’s post reminded me of this, but my mom, TexAnne, tried to sneak in photo shoots of herself and her family at other people’s weddings for literal years.

The family has a friend that is a top notch photographer and she’s photographed every event. It’s a great deal for everyone considering she charges a great rate for how amazing she is and she would have been invited anyway.

TexAnne, however, thinks that this means she is free to direct family friend to do whatever TexAnne would like. At no less than 3 different weddings TexAnne has tried to wrangle family friend into doing a photo shoot of just TexAnne and TexAnne’s kids, who at most are cousins to the parties getting married. 

Family friend, being a pro, has always been like “Great! Where’s the bride and groom, you guys stand right in the middle...” 

Floating around out there somewhere are photos of my mom, her three kids, and three different sets of brides and grooms who are somewhat confused by the photo’s composition. My mom has never hung these photos up. 

My wedding is coming up in 2 weeks and family friend is the photographer. It’s anyone’s guess at all how my mom will try to direct her what to do. I’m not at all worried. Family friend is an absolute professional and a gem of a human being, and it’s husband and I who get all the files and the privilege of disbursing them!

Edit to add: She also tried to exclude my husband from the last one, but my gran went and found him and pushed him into the picture, guaranteeing my mom would never ever hang it"
234,"For simplicity’s sake, I’ll refer to BF’s Grandma as GMIL.

Before I met GMIL, BF told me that she’s never really liked any of his girlfriends. She’s told him that they’re not good enough for him, not nice enough, and at one point even told him to his face that his girlfriend is ugly. She acts as a mother figure to him since his mom is gone. She met me about a week or two ago and I thought it went well.

She was over at his house today like she is every Sunday. I had spent the night so I woke up to her talking to FIL and a family friend. She came over to the living room and asked me if I could put a channel on. I said yes and put the channel on for her. She thanked me, then moments later, called BF over and said, “She put this on and I don’t like it, it takes away from this other show” and tried getting my BF to change the channel. I sat there quietly but I thought, “You fucking asked me to put the channel on, and now you’re bitching about it?”

Am I being weird with wanting to be on guard with her now? I already was a bit wary of her from the start due to what BF has told me about her not liking any of his girlfriends, and today just irritated me. Perhaps this is a one time thing, I’m hoping it is, but... I’m just lost as to how you can complain about me putting the channel you asked for on... What?"
235,"So when the family gets together, they always talk about how this psycho screwed them.
My JYM is in MI right now visiting her brother and we were just informed that she really did him dirty with the sales of his home.

1999
 My Uncle lives in one of the houses that he grew up in with my just JYGMr and JYGP. After my JYGP got remarried, my uncle (his son) was still living in the house and wanted to update it for him and his family. So my grandfather ""owned it"" (he put the house in his and Lady Tremaynes name) and my Uncle was in the process of remodeling and purchasing it from him which he was permitted todo with his own money, she didnt want to fund any renos. Lady Tremayne did not like the fact that my grandfather would go and help his son with the remodel. She hated the fact that my JYGP had children of his own and helped them when they asked.  He had always spend time with her  2 daughters and their children but saw his son maybe once or twice every 2 weeks to help  with the house. 

At the point where they were in the process of purchasing the house from my grandfather and LT my Uncle had already put $10,000 into the house. So it raises The value about 15k to 20k depending upon the work that was done.  My grandfather never paid the bills so she did all the budgeting work with the money that she and he would make. So she hired some lawyers to re write-up their sales contract to include an addendum that because improvements were done on the house, the cost for the purchaser would go up.  Even though it was my Uncle who lived in the house, who is purchasing the house, it was his money that was put into the improvements.

I dont know what was going through my JYGP head when the whole thing was happening, because really, he could have quashed it unless she was abusing him. We'll never know now...
Part of the contract was that he had to pay an additional 10k within the first year or it would default. My uncle couldnt afford a lawyer to fight so he paid his 5k deposit AND another 10k because LT thought he had come into money and wanted to take advantage. After he signed the contract (which he had no where else to go after having a new baby in 1999) she called tp ""congratulate"" him and said ""you mess with the bull, you get the horns.."" then she hung up.

I mean, what a hateful wench. There are more stories, stay tuned!"
236,"My boyfriend is 17, I am 18, and we have been dating a little under a year. I love the man but his mom is a different story. When I actually meet up with her she's nice and polite, she puts on this sweet lady act. But I know it isn't how she actually feels because she's told him. A few months ago, around August, she told him to break up with me. He didn't, obviously, but he did tell me what she said. I'm kind of happy about knowing, as much as it sucks, because I wouldn't want to think she likes me if she really wants us to break up. After that I asked him to please keep me in the loop about what his mom says and he has. 

A few days ago it was his birthday dinner and I went out with him and his family. Just for reference I was wearing jeans and a sweater. It was fairly awkward but not like, painfully so. As soon as I get out of the car she says that I am a slut. This is something that comes up a lot. She's totally convinced that, well, I am one. Not that I think there's anything wrong with having sex but I resent the assumption. Me and SO are each other's first everything and we haven't had sex but she'd never believe that. She's also very strict and I only rarely see him lately. At the same time though she thinks that, because we don't see each other often, I'm not really his girlfriend and our relationship means nothing. 

She isn't my actual MIL and we're both in high school so if this isn't the right group I understand. But I think you can probably relate. On the one hand I know I'm only hearing his side, but I really don't doubt it. I don't know what I'm trying to gain from this accept maybe a third party opinion"
237,"So last night I had my murder mystery birthday party. We had got some texts from eggs a few hours before it, but since I turned notifications off, I didn't see them. My sister asked if I saw them, and I hadn't. I decided not to even look at them until after my party, and I didn't. I had a blast! I was the killer btw, and I got to kill a few people by cursing them so that they bust into flame out of nowhere, it was so awesome. I also got a plain cheesecake from Costco, and made some strawberry syrup and stuck a knife in it and used the syrup to look like blood. Everyone had fun and I didn't have to worry about offending my mother (She didn't even know about this party, we were afraid she'd be jealous she wasn't invited, so we planned on having a decoy party to appease her. Now I don't even have to do that!)

My actual birthday is on Wednesday, and I'm thinking about giving myself the gift of finally blocking her. I'm not sure, I still weave back and forth on whether or not I want to know what she is saying to us. Anyway, I'll give y'all some updates on the latest stuff since my last post. Writing it out here really helps me to know that this is really happening and it really is bullshit. 

So, last I left you guys, she was threatening to come over. She hasn't made good on the threat, as our dad had talked her out of it. Also, she had given my sister notice that she was going to come over on Friday to have the garage door fixed, and my sister (as is her legal right) denied that notice. Basically, Eggs can only come in if there is an emergency repair. A garage door that hasn't been fixed in four years is no emergency. 

So on Thursday, Eggs had a hissy-fit and tried to say it's her right as a landlord to make repairs to the house, and she is just going to do it. I told my sister that she should call non-emergency and ask them what to do in the event the landlord disregards the notice that says she can't enter. We also found out from dad that Eggs was bluffing cause she already cancelled the appointment with the garage fixing people. Later that day, my sister got this hilarious text: (stuff in parenthesis are my reactions)

""I do not trust you to not call the cops on me. (good!) I have cancelled the garage door. I will do it when you are gone. I gave you many days notice via text (which is not an official way of giving notice, btw). You could have just gone to work or taken (sister's cute little doggy) for a walk or went and had coffee. (Um, NO. We don't trust you with our stuff- my studio is in that garage and I can't have her messing with my business) This is so unreal because you have finally broke the straw that held the camel's back. (I seriously laughed for like 5 minutes on that one, and we have shared many straw and camel jokes since) You are unhinged, at best. Way over the top. I apologize no more. (haven't once heard a valid apology from you) You do not deserve it and I take back my power. ... I will cry no more. (riiiiight)""

So, she's at least becoming a bit laughable. We didn't hear anything else from her until last nights text which I didn't read until after the party and I'm so glad. When I did read it, I was able to kinda shrug it off and go to bed. It's super strange though and I'll share it with you. She's got some weird fascination with having her power back. Here's what she sent the both of us around 3ish pm:

""Wow, having so much fun. I've got my power back. You don't get to take it away anymore. It the first day I have felt this in a while. Ha ha ha! You have no control over my suffering any more. I refuse to suffer for you anymore.""

""Meaning... you have gone way way way way over the top""

Then, at around 6ish pm: ""...""

What does she expect to get from that? It's so weird, it's just become kind of amusing at this point. I'm just like, good for you? haha. 

I am a bit sad about my upcoming birthday. I am going to have dinner with my grandpa and invited Dad along. I knew that he would likely not be able to come, and said I would understand, but I'm still a little sad when he did say he wouldn't be able to. That's ok, he'll probably spend my birthday trying to keep Eggs calm, and I'm so glad that won't be how I spend it."
238,"Just by way of background, FIL made a decent amount of money. MIL has never worked and was a SAHM and then did nothing after her kids moved out of the house.  MIL spends millions of her husband's money on luxury cars, homes, plastic surgery, etc. while being relatively stingy with their kids.

Anyway, MIL is a narcissist (as seen in my other posts).  What's really bizarre is, she seems intent on controlling her husband's money even after she dies. She is currently in her early 70s and her kids are only in their early to mid 30s.  She told them that she put a clause in the will that they cannot touch anything until they are 50. She will probably be long dead by the time they are 50....I'm not sure why she cares so much how her kids use money long after she is dead...is this is a characteristic of narcissists? I don't really get it because she didn't even make they money or work, so why would she care."
239,"UPDATE: She texted back last night and said that she thought we said that she could make her one. 🙄 our plan is to send her screenshots of the texts telling her our wishes and asking where did we say that making her one was okay? 
Is that fair? I do not want to drop this because she’ll just push it in the future. 
———————————


I’m the one with the MIL that has been pushing significant holiday things onto my DH that has no significant meaning to him. We both decided we wanted to be the ones to get those things for our DD. We’ve made that clear twice and both texts were responded to with “that’s fine.” You can read my history. It’s kinda short. 

JNMIL has me livid. I guess we weren’t clear enough cause MIL sent a text to DH yesterday with a picture of her usual homemade stocking and a text that said “this stocking is for DD.” 🙄 he wasn’t going to show me the text until tomorrow because he works his last night shift for the weekend tonight so we’d have more time to talk. 
He texted her back “I told you we were getting her a stocking.” It’s been 4 hours and she hasn’t responded which is her go to when she doesn’t get what she wants. 
About 2 hours after that I texted SIL2 about how cute DNi is in her dress that she posts on the book of faces. Turns out that MIL told SIL that we told her we wanted her to make the stocking. 🙄🤦‍♀️ 

I don’t want to rug sweep of course but I know DH thinks of he says something firmly he’s going to hurt her feelings. DH knows he needs to be firm because this is so obvious she doesn’t give a shit about what we say regardless if we’re 2,000 miles away or not. She’s also pushing to go over to SIL’s for Christmas Day even though SIL has told her multiple times that Christmas Day is for their family(she’s due a couple week before Christmas so they’ll have a new born and a 2 year old) even though MIL is invited to go over Christmas Eve. 🙄 
I know I can’t do anything about SIL’s situation but what should DH do about MIL? 
Should we text her again, calling her out with the screenshots that prove what we told her? 
Or just not say anything? She’ll just end up texting in a week or so about something completely off topic and rug sweep. Should we call her out then? 
I’m tempted to remind her of her actions that caused us to go NC before we moved and say that we’re close to going No again. 
I know it’s probably BEC but she needs to know that she’s overstepped. 
Any advise and words of encouragement would be lovely!"
240,"In general my mom is a JustYes. She really has gone above and beyond for me over the last few years but occasionally has some JustNo moments. Like today. I have some chronic health issues that make it not really safe for me to live alone. The same issues keep me from working and forced me to walk away from getting my professional degree when I had three weeks and one major exam left. I ended up with a conciliation prize degree instead. Not the worst thing ever since by that point my health meant I could never actually put my degree to work, it wouldn’t be safe. I moved back in with Mom after that and she provides 100% of my financial support (Dad passes away five years ago, they were married for over 40 years). 
Due to one of my conditions continuing to worsen I’ve been referred to a surgeon to see if there is a surgical fix. Mom insisted that she come to the appointment with me (one of my issues is major memory problems and she worries I won’t remember to tell the surgeon every plus worried I won’t remember the details of what I discuss with him). The appointment is tomorrow and is about an hour away from the house. She come down today in a bit of a state because she seems to have just realized where his office is. She starts talking about how it’s this huge problem and says “you can see why it’s a problem right?”.  I said actually I didn’t. Some of my previous surgeries were also at hospitals around an hour away. Also she hadn’t said anything about it being an issue in the four months since I scheduled the appointment. Apparently she thought it’s just where he is that day and he works out of multiple office. He may, I don’t know, I just know he’s who my specialist referred me to, that I haven’t committed to having any surgery, and the appointment is to find it if he thinks there is a surgery that may help. It also doesn’t help that I’ve been vomiting nonstop for the last 50 hours or so and am doing my best to keep hydrated and out of the ER. My brain isn’t exactly functioning is top shape right now. When I said I didn’t see the problem she started getting upset and once I talked her down a bit it she comes out with how the distance is a problem because she has dogs to take care of and that I react badly to anesthesia...????
Yeah, I’m not really following either. She knows if I end up having surgery I don’t expect her to spend time visiting me in the hospital. I had spinal surgery 7 years ago and was in the hospital for 5 days. She and my dad drove me to and from surgery, visited briefly when I was out of recovery, and visited one other time for about half an hour before picking me up. I was hospitalized in May for intractable vomiting and didn’t ask her to visit- I only asked her to bring me a change of clothes because I had been admitted through the ER and hadn’t brought anything with me. I ended up speaking with my doctor while she was there and we agreed I could go home so really she just provided a ride to and from the hospital. I don’t like having people around while I’m sick!
I think her issue isn’t really the distance, I think it’s that she really dislikes the idea of surgery in general and the whole thing stresses her the fuck out. This would be the first time I’ve had surgery since my dad died and the second surgery in the family since then. Her elderly dog is sick and that is stressing her. Finances are stressing her (but thanks to my earlier hospitalization if I have to have surgery I’ve already met my out of pocket max for the year so it would cost anything but copays). The way she talked though it was as though she feels I’m no longer allowed to have any sort of surgery unless it’s life or death because she finds it so stressful. Sorry you’re stressed by it mom?  She also finds my vomiting episodes stressful and has been hassling me to find a better solution. Because I haven’t thought of that or anything, I love spending days at a time puking my guts out despite multiple antiemetics and haven’t spent years searching for a solution. I haven’t seen multiple specialists or gone to a tertiary care center (big name university hospital) trying to get it under control. 
I guess I’m just supposed to magic myself better because my having surgery is stressful for her?
Honestly I can only shake my head and laugh about it now. My mom has never had surgery. She’s never had a major injury or illness. Her only hospital stays were for the births of her kids. My sister and I on the other hand are both chronic pain patients with multiple chronic illnesses. Mom doesn’t understand how complicated dealing with all of it is and seems to feel their should be an easy fix. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told if I just ate better I’d be fine- ignoring the fact I barely eat at all these days. 
I love her and am so grateful for everything she does for me but find this all just a wee bit exasperating."
241,"So we are lowish contact, she comes over on average once every 3ish weeks for a couple of supervised hours (always happening to be here for free dinner, of course, eye roll!).
I barely talk to her, have dropped the rope and let DH deal.
However, last weekend his mum just waltzed on into our bedroom. again. She was looking for my DH and LO. i saw red, followed, and was like EXCUSE ME! GET. OUT!
Apparently this makes me DISRESPECTFUL (her emphasis).
She sent a rant to my DH that basically escalated from:
I violated your space -&gt; how dare you tell me to get out -&gt; I  am terribly hurt -&gt; you are a disloyal son -&gt; I am going to be homeless and die

DH shut her down wonderfully. Thank good he is totally aware of her bs and barely tolerates her. 

However, further poor me messages have resulted in her ultimatum that she's not coming to my home until I apologise to her. 

Ha! Too bad so sad that's not gonna happen.
What a pity. I am so disappointed. /s"
242,"My JNMom's unmanaged, irrational anxiety is as unmanaged and irrational as it was when I last posted. I don't have the energy to go into all the crap she's said and/or done but will include a few for your entertainment at the end of this post.

The main update is that my JYUncle did tell me the other day via text that she admitted to him she's absolutely convinced neither my dad nor I could survive without her. (BG: I'm in my thirties, a mom of an almost toddler, have been married 5 years and lived across the country from her since 2008)

So yep. That explains a whole lot.

Some bonus crazy gems from the last few months though, while we're here:

* LO is at the stage where she explores things by putting them in her mouth. My mom is utterly convinced this will cause her mouth to become deformed, like a frog's (my mom is a retired American medical professional, btw)
* My mom is constantly trying to pathologize the fact that LO is uncontainable and always on the move (she just figured out crawling, is working on sitting up and standing so . . . yeah. Totally normal baby). I had been taking psych meds for a while before DH and I started trying to have kids, and JNMom actually asked me whether I was still taking them and if that was what caused LO to be like this, which was such an absurd and awful thing to say I just couldn't even address it.
* JNMom insists I need to be feeding LO meat and eggs every single day or she'll become malnourished due to lack of protein. To avoid too much identifying info but to give you an idea how absurd this is, LO is between 8-10 months old, and as my post history will show my JNMom is of custard tart fame, and was trying to control my diet while I was struggling to get my breast milk supply back up to speed after an illness back when LO was exclusively breastfed.
* JNMom full on screamed when LO spilled some food onto her chest while I was feeding her from a baby food pouch. Like . . . really?! 

~~JNMom still doesn't have a nickname. I really liked Drama Mama for a while but saw that someone else is using it now, so am open to suggestions.~~ Also, JNMom and Eh-Dad are coming to town next month so you'll probably being hearing more again from me soon. As for the flair- it was an update but not quite a success, so this was the one that fit best, but I’m also open to the most deliciously petty responses you can come up with because I love them.

ETA: /u/Tangytrooper19 reminded me that the nickname I'd been thinking of was in fact Melodrama Mama which I still really, really like. So that's who she'll be!"
243,"Yes, here I am with my own bit of holiday trouble shooting. 

So updates: JNparents still on vacay, my siblings and I are really enjoying this time since it has allowed us to get some personal projects done with minimal interference (these include bread pudding experiments, cleaning up a hoarders worthy living room, getting a wedding dress). Not sure how to tell JNMom that I went ahead and got a wedding dress without her opinions. As for my own moving out, that still depends on how soon I can get my medical examination prior to starting the job. 

Now for the question: how to deal with the holidays. We Filipinos tend to have massive family reunions at this time of the year, with all the fun and drama in between. 

Usually my family attends FOUR reunions from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day evening. Christmas Eve is always, always with my dad's side. Christmas day lunch is with my late grandmother's extended family, then we go off to see my late grandfather's extended family too (the backstory for these is long and best left for other subs). Then Christmas day dinner is with my JNMom's more JYfamily (my uncles and my cousins). JNMom likes attending all of these on HER pace, and has told me she does not want to hear of me having to leave a reunion early for whatever reason. Yet it is also understood that FDH will have to attend most of these, at least the dinners. 

Which kinda sucks since I know I have to visit FDH's side this Christmas. They keep their family home open on Christmas Day for any kin who drop in, and I know they will want to see me and FDH. I really like FDH's extended family, and they have received me very well. 

I really am trying to figure out how to manage all of these. JNMom is sure to make a bit of a fuss that I will have to leave luncheon so I can make the trip to FDH's family, since they are just in the same city for crying out loud! Then of course she's going to give me crap for possibly being late for dinner for her side. Which is funny since she isn't hosting it, it's my uncle who's been hosting the holiday dinners for the past years. 

So how to deal with this JNMom who likes to have the last word on plans? Help!"
244,"So my JNM and JNS have been emailing me non stop about things they want to drop off at my house. My SO and I are moving very soon and they have all cut me out of their lives (see previous posts). 

Today my JNM emails to say she has more childhood stuff to drop off. I responded saying please don't do that, we have no more room for things in the garage. I would be happy to come get everything once we are moved. To which she responds that I am under no circumstances allowed to go to her home. She lives around the corner currently.... so I'm very tempted to call the police to have them guard my house then arrest her for trespassing since I responded to say she is then not allowed on my property to leave things....

I am so mentally exhausted from all this. They want to cut me out and yet they won't stop contacting me in such little hurtful ways.

UPDATE: After telling my mother not to trespass she did. So I finally called the police and filed a report against her. I'm going to court today to file for an order of protection so she can't keep reaching out to me. And cameras will be installed on the new house."
245,"We are finally going to Sunday dinner tonight at JNMILs house after the big argument about not going over every other weekend. 

Some background: we have a now 4 month old ebf baby, and JNMIL lives 45 minutes away and expected us to come over with the baby every other sunday. I felt this was unreasonable, my DH and I argued about it, and in the end we came to a compromise: JNMIL could come whenever she wanted, and we would go once a month. Important to note that my parents are super involved with the baby, bring us dinner at least once a week, walk our dog, tidy up a bit, and come over in accordance to babys nap and feeding schedule. I dont even expect this of them. They live close, but both work about 45 minutes away. They come after work sometimes if it's early enough, and visit on the weekends if DH and I are up to it. 

My own parents involvement with the baby infuriates JNMIL bc she's crazy. 

Well after a while, DH really came to see how unreasonable his mother is. She refuses to come during the week claiming 'she works' and doesn't have time. Shes tired. She has to feed the dog. Whatever. She works during the week so she runs errands on weekends and doesn't have time then. DH replied that everyone works. She replied that OP doesn't work. Like I'm supposed to drive up to her as a ftm with my baby? I'm not even sure what she meant by that comment. 

Before DH was a bit defensive of his mom. Now he is totally on my team. He told JNMIL that we wouldn't be going to her house at all until she made an effort to come to us. Fantastic. We have not been bothered with going since. 

Today it is ruined. It's DHs brothers birthday. DH wants to go to his brother's get together (at JNMILs house) as they are close and the whole family will be there. Including (obviously) JNMIL. I'm irritated that she is going to get time with my baby and feel like she's won bc my DH wants to attend. He told me we don't have to go, but I know he wants to see everyone and it's really not practical to have our own get together for his brother where everyone else would be there. Going today would just be what's easiest for us. I think I'm going to suck it up and go. 

ETA: after we said we wouldn't bother going at all for Sunday dinner, part of our new compromise was that if we weren't going to weekly OR monthly dinners, that we would still make an effort to go to (some) holidays and birthday get togethers. I thought it was a way better deal to go to these 'events' then have a regular, required monthly get together. And husband agreed. 

I want advice on how to interact with JNMIL. I dont like her. I don't want to be around her. But I do want us to be included in his brothers day and I want our baby to see everyone besides JNMIL. 

Is it just that I can't have both?"
246,"Nothing huge here to report. Just a few questions. We went NC with JNILs back in April and all had been pretty much quiet.

Got a text from MWCW about a month ago. She asked if DH was ok. I didn't respond at all.

So about a week prior to this I noticed a relative(wife of GCBIL) of DH kept popping up on my book of faces wall a lot. This is strange because we never have anything to do them, live about 4 hrs from them, and we pretty much never like each other's stuff.

I know the book of faces has a bizarre algorithm to show the most important people you interact with on your wall.

So I felt it was awfully coincidental that I see stuff from her a week prior to getting the first text from MWCW.

I think MWCW has recruited the wife of GCBIL as her spying flying monkey, but have no way to prove it.

And......wife of GCBIL also popped up again this week on the book of faces wall.

It's been all radio silence with JNILs, so I feel like I am waiting for a new wave of shit to begin.

Or is it because the holidays are closing in that MWCW is testing the waters to see if she can rope us back in?

Because when MWCW realizes we won't be there to spend the holidays together....shit will definitely hit the fan, close to extinction burst level.

Edit for typos"
247,"Fiancé texted me yesterday while he was at work about wanting to go to the pumpkin patch with our 7 month old son, I said sure. I was excited to go to the patch with them and spend time with them. Now fiancés family, including JNMIL, have invited themselves. Fiancé said it was fine because his sister and dad want to see our son. I however am sick to my stomach with a pounding headache now thinking about being around JNMIL. My anxiety gets terrible thinking about being around her and being around her. I don’t want her around my son and I hate being forced into stuff like this..."
248,"Throwaway account so FDH (m27) and I (f26) can do this post together. TLDR at the bottom.

My family's coming to stay with us at Christmas. My dad is very justyes, my brother is 70% justno but will behave with our parents around, and my mom is... I love her very much and we are very close, but she does have some toxic behaviors. Please be kind in your advice.

First up: my parents are bringing their year old dog. Mom told me this instead of asking the first time we discussed holiday plans. The second time we started making hard plans, I asked if they would consider boarding their dog since he gets carsick on short rides and they live 8 hours away. Also, we have three animals of our own (two cats, one dog), and we're concerned how they'd get along.

Their dog is high energy, barks a lot, begs/tries to steal people food, plays rough (biting and scratching), and I'm not sure if he's gotten past his peeing in the house issues (which I know is mainly a product of his age, but my parents aren't the best at training consistently). He's partly crate trained but sleeps in bed with them.

Mom insists on bringing the dog, so I tell her the dog will have to sleep downstairs in a crate. We got new carpet installed a couple months ago, and the only animal we let upstairs is the one cat that is declawed and has a medical condition.

She didn't really like that. She asked if we could compromise and just let their dog upstairs in the guest room overnight. FDH doesn't want the dog upstairs at all, but worries he should just roll over and avoid conflict. Imo, our house means our rules. Plus she has a long history of talking me out of my own wants.

Second issue: our holiday menu. FDH and I are mostly vegetarian. Mom has offered/insisted on buying tons of groceries to help prepare her style of Christmas feast (around 10 dishes including a hella expensive crown roast). She did this after several conversations where we worked out a smaller menu centered on fish (since we all eat that at least). I keep telling her it's a lot of food we can't/wouldn't eat, which would be a lot of uneaten leftovers, and I didn't want her to spend all that money. She's starting to take offense at my refusal and idk how to resolve this amicably.

TL;DR my mom's pushing back on our rules for the dog she's insisting on bringing at Christmas and wants to take over making dinner at our first hosted holiday."
249,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted the second to the last conversation I ever had with TPP. This is the LAST one. Ever. VERY early 2016, when my lawyer told me I needed to break NC and inform her to stop contacting me. (I'd not spoken to her in well over a month). 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *""Hi, can (brother) bring me to see DD for an hour Saturday please? I would love to bring her to the park. After it dryies. I miss her smilly face. Do you think we can put the past behind is go on as a family. I've never hurt you, never put down on you and I will never do either to the baby. You and BROTHER have always been my heart. I busted my butt to help you get what other girls had and loved all the sleepovers. I wanted you on that pedestal like the others. I want to be part of DD dancing or gymnastics. Im sorry I've made you hate me so much. I miss you. I love yall. Please let me see DD.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Are you feeling better?"" (She'd been looking on my EOBs from my forced INS to see i'd been to the ENT).*

*""You could at least answer yes or no. I am worried about you. I don't understand why you hate me. I was always a great mom. I don't understand why you made that comment on fb. People asking me why you said your protecting your child. I tell them from DH's mom not me! We had a lot of fun when you was growing up. I have never hurt you and I never would and I will never hurt my grandbaby. Don't forget all our good times and try and let those few bad times  you have stuck in your memory go. I love you.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Can I come get DD sunday morning and take her to preaching with me at (random church I've never known her to go to that happens to be by my house)? Please.""* 

Me- **""No""**

Tpp, 7 hours later- *""thanks for taking DD and yall visiting grandma yesterday. That meant a lot to her. Now if you will forgive me and lets move forward. I would love to see yall.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- **""Stop contacting me.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP- *""You're my daughter DD is my grandbaby and i have another graddaughter on the way I will never give up, OP. Its called love.""* 

*""You and I was so close once. Why are you hating me now? I have never abused you. We had fun when you was growing up. Can't you remember the fun? all the sleepovers?""* 

Me- **""""sleepovers"" don't erase the belittling, gaslighting, and name calling you've done over the years, but to be most specific, perhaps you should reread your messages to me from November on. If you see nothing wrong with the way you treat me and have treated me then that's YOUR problem but I will not be enduring for any longer, and my children will certainly not be subjected to that. You can stop texting- I have nothing else to say. You an stop asking for DD-I'm her mother, not you, and it's my job to protect her. If you're looking for the most recent example-how you handled the insurance situation. You got what you wanted, I even shared an ultrasound photo of my child with you- and then nope you decided you weren't holding up to your word. I never thought you would-I know you FAR too well after 25 years to believe you'd do something to help me. My children won't be treated as such. Have a nice night.**"" 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *""I had not belittled you. ANd I would never ever hurt my grandbabies and i can not belive you would think I would. I have never done nothing but love you and I have never hurt nor hardmed DD. Keeping you on the insruance is for your on good. Its not to be in your business. Its to help you.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Me. ""**I'm 25 years old. I believe i know a bit more about my medical information and needs than you do. You have zero idea as to how your insurance helps or affects me. You should probably call them and ask them how much they pay for maternity for a dependent. You should also call around and ask how many providers take more than one billing insurance-it's not many. You already know if all insurances aren't presented it's fraud, as you so gleefully told me I would 'go back to jail if i didn't use it'. Of course you don't care because YOUR only concern is being right and in control. And no, you just proved again you do not care for anybody but yourself and keeping me under your thumb. I have nothing else to say to you.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP. *""You have treated me a lot worse than i could ever treat you. But it has never stopped me from telling you i love you and it will never stop me from it. You can change your number but I will get it. It don't pay maternity but it pays lab and other bills Like meds. Its not about me being right , its about trying to help you.""*

*""As for you telling people you are protecting your child from what you went thru. Your making yourself look foolish beause anyone that knows you knows how close we was and how much fun we had growing up and know how protective I was of you. They know I would kick butt over my kids to keep you from being hurt in any way. Your are a mom and an adult OP. Its time to let things go and move past things. You know I would never hurt you and or the babies. It's not about me breing right OP its never been about that it's about wanting to see you and dd. Nothing more. except loving ya'll. And I love you and DD.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she sends me a screenshot of my entire prescription list, dosage, and prescribing doctor and says *""Don't help? ha ok. Your welcome.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

10 hours later, ""*Can I come by and see my grandbaby?""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Head, meet wall."
250,"I recently had a baby. During what should be a nice bonding time with my husband and my newborn, I’m fighting with my in laws.

The people I wanted in the room while I’m legs up fanny out were my mother, and my husband. The hospital only allows 2 non medical people in the room anyway.

My mother in law who lives in a different state and I’ve only met a handful of times flew down for the birth of her first grandchild. Perfectly acceptable, perfectly normal.

My mother in law gets here 2 days before im due to get induced. She says she’s so excited to see her first grandchild be brought into the world. We tell her she’s not going to be in the room, as the hospital only allows 2 guests at a time and it’s going to be my mother and my husband aka the other parents to the human I’m pushing out of me.

She says my husband will be living with the baby and she should be able to be there when her first grandchild comes into the world.

We tell her no and that we’re sorry she was under the assumption she would be in the room. 
She kind of pouts but doesn’t bring it up again.

The day of my induction comes and I’m in active labor when she comes barging in and goes “no hospital is going to stop me from seeing my grand baby.”

I tell her to get out and that she’s not going to be in the room. I admittedly was short with her and a little rude.

The nurse escorts her out and that’s the end of that 

But over the next 3 days we get calls and texts and emails and Facebook messages calling us cruel and saying we robbed her of an experience and we should be ashamed that we didn’t let her in the room. 

I’m exhausted and my whole in law side of my family is shaming me."
251,"Sorry for anyone who saw this in r/JustNoSO. I was advised this would be a more appropriate place. Here's what I posted:

 

I'll try to keep it to the relevant details. If there is a something you want to know sound off.

Only  child. Mom remarried when I was 6. Dad adopted me (not biological, but  in every important way). Mom is the sole 'parent'. Dad never chimed in  regards to parenting.

Moved six  times prior to middle school. This is was so Dad could work in his  chosen (professional, white collar, lab) job. No problem. Also, no  siblings or friends for more than a couple months. So not sure what  'normal' home life was like.

Up  until the last move, was advised by Mom I was fat. Told me bedtime  stories about 'the fattest man in world had to be buried in a piano  case'. 'No woman would ever want me'. Trying on clothes ""not that one,  you look fat"". Crying yourself to sleep was. . . . unpleasant.  Especially when you didn't know what to do about it.

Was  reading and doing math at 7th grade level in 4th grade. No  encouragement or attempt to maybe put in better than public school. (It  would have been easily affordable to them). But I had no idea such  things were available.

By 9th  grade I was doing all the laundry, dishes, mowing the lawn, washing the  car, sweeping dusting etc. No problem, I did get an allowance (don't  recall how much) but I was usually ok for $. Also played 3x sports a  year - Football, Wrestling and Track. Needless to say I was busy.

So  I was this 6'1"" #260 decent looking kid. Quasi athletic, marginally  above average intelligence. Eagle Scout. But I had about 0% confidence  in general. And less with females. I'm sure you can figure how that  worked out for me.

Sorry for  rambling. Hope i wasn't bloviating. Fast forward. I found an angel of a  woman and we fall in love, and get married. We planned to have it in our  pastors office, just the three of us. Mom finds out and says if we  don't invite her, she'll never talk to me again. I'm fairly sure she was  serious.

So, in the rectory, we  begin. Prior to vows, the Pastor had some nice things to say, then my  Mom chimed in. Spoke about her husband / my Dad who had passed 6 years  prior. A good 20 minute ad hoc pity party for herself. Closed her  anecdote by bringing herself to tears. Not about happiness for my  wedding - for her loss. It was difficult for me to reconcile my  happiness for my future wife and I and the desire to be able to use the  Darth Vader choke hold.

I had left  home as soon as I could after HS graduation. I was living in the town  where my Alma Mater was. My wife lived in my hometown, as did my Mom. My  Mom had a ginormous built to spec home. The basement, or as she  required it to be called 'lower level' was a complete apartment even  with exterior access. She offered to let my wife and (step, but only in  name - love her as if she were my own) daughter stay there.

Mom  thought that made my wife and daughter her new BFF's. Which would have  been great, but she was treating them more like 'lackeys' or 'minions'  than friends. Mom and her husband went on a cruise, and asked family to  watch her dog. Ok, no big deal. Then she added 'please pick up her poop  from the yard'. WOW. If it had been a Bull Mastiff, Great Dane or  whatever I could *maybe*  understand. But it was this weird hybrid of yorkie / chihuahua /  pomeranian I don't know. So it's turds were like tiny. Well, family  didn't tell me until after (they didn't do it) but I was livid.

Family  finally moves down, and all is well. Keep contact with Mom limited to  holidays and maybe every other month a visit. This is not working so bad  until Thanksgiving of year 7. She sends me an email right before  Thanksgiving. ""We will be with her husbands daughters family for the  holiday. Sorry for the late notice. And I've decided to change some  things in my will. We can discuss after the holidays"".

Well,  I had seen my Dad's will. I won't go into detail, but she wasn't  upholding the spirit or the letter of it. After playing her game long  enough, she finally said ""This is because you don't love me the way I  want you to. I didn't raise you like this."" I'll spare the details, but  over the years since I moved from home she would send me these thinly  veiled hate mail's like this. Best guess, maybe a dozen. I'd usually  roll over and kind of do the minimal to appease her.

This  time I came back like a tiger whose tail you just stepped on. I copied  and pasted her email in a response, and very critically reviewed each of  her comments. Calling her out on every BS comment. Stating ""what's that  got to do with me?"" frequently. There was also no shortage of 'who  cares?' and 'your point is. . . .?'. This was totally new to her. I had  showed my wife the email and my response, and she said 'well, it'll be a  while before she answers'. I said 'nope - she has no impulse control /  internal filter. She'll send a ridic response within an hour'. Which she  did.

Wrapping up, I know my  inheritance from her should be in the low 7 figures. While that'd be  nice, I'm not willing to play her game for it. Last she mentioned  disowning me, I said 'I can't lose something I never had.' And ended  with 'I expect nothing from you, and I'm never disappointed'

I'm  on the fence. Is it worth my time to even cultivate a relationship with  her? I have no siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins or grandparents left.  Neither does she. My wife wants me to cut all ties, and daughter is  apathetic/cut ties.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far, TL:DR family issues"
252,"Hi everybody here, back at it with Hallmark Horseshit.

I have been effectively NC/VVVVVVVVVLC *(1 very limited meeting on neutral grounds in 4-5 months where my petty self was very pleased that she kept on pushing ""say GRANNY, say GRANNY"" to my 10m old LO (who can't even talk yet!) and he recoiled and crawled very close to me. Petty, yes. Fun for me, yes.)* and my partner has been VVVVVLC as well, and is finally completely on my side.

By which I mean: he finally said himself, out loud, that she is a narcissistic person, who will never change or alter her way, will never see fault in all she has done to him, to me and to us as a new family and he has given up on the idea that he should be able to change her or that she even is capable of any change at all.

I had been trying to get it through his head that HE should not fix this, HE was not at fault except that he could have been more supportive, but that it was Hallmark Horseshit that threated with a lawyer, it was HH that said I was no longer welcome in the house *(to which consequently I said: ""I’m not welcome, then my kid is not welcome."" Jeez, how that backfired for her, hoping her son would come back to mommy with grandchild coming along. Lol, nope)* and it was HH that created this entire wrong, painful and ugly “MIL/DIL-relationship” the moment she decided to compete with me, starting when we first met up to the birth of my child for the affection from her son and then her grandson, our LO.

He literally said that she has this idea that being a grandmother grants her magic rights and authority over us and that he just cannot have a person like that in his/our life. Her entire person is the front of being a champion grandmother (a maternal figure in everybody's life, a matriarch, the family leader in her eyes) while reality is that she has seen her first grandchild a maximum of 5 times in all of the 10 months of life, and has no idea what is going on in our lives, or in her son’s life and is grasping imaginery power trips.

The last blow-up was at the beginning of this week because my SO was up till then somethimes still torn between being partially in the FOG (there was still a juvenile shimmer of hope for some form of reconciliation and her apologizing) and reality setting in slowly, and the reason for this yet another fight was my SO suggesting to her *(after she had been nagging and nagging to see her grandchild. Not to see her son. Not to talk to her son. No, to see her grandchild. The tone and the intent of how she said is is so malicient)* to meet again (about 1 month after last meeting) in a public place.

She blew up at him, send horrible, horrible messages *(can’t screenshot as the language is not English, but will provide a transcript later today after translation)* and pushed my SO out of the fog completely, with the help of my parents to whom my SO turned to for help and have a heart to heart with, because he could not comprehend why his mother could keep on treating and abusing him even after all that has been said and done, after all his limiting of contact and so, she still assumed that she was the nr. 1 in his life and his “boss”, giving out orders and demanding his blind obedience because

“she had always been a good mother and they have paid/done so much for him”

= did the normal parental thing the law requires you, provide food/shelter/clothing and school necessities.

Love, support, let your child be without constant pressure to be some sort of sonsband or even quite simply: do not tell your son that he is no longer your son when he disagrees with how you treat his SO…? Not so parental goodness much in my biased opinion.

Anyhow, now that you have some updates, I do need some input from you guys.

FIL has reached out to my partner yesterday, and asked that he and us meet to talk.We discussed this, where SO said he wanted to have some relationship with his father and I asked whether anything FIL said, could change my SO’s view on the situation, on his mother’s behavior and personality, and thus getting him back into the FOG.

SO swore that nothing his father could say would make him go back to thinking his mother could change, no matter if FIL said:

“but that’s how she is, we should accept her, we should get over it, they didn’t meant it that way, she wasn’t really going to get a lawyer or sue us, OP is allowed in our house, she loves OP as DIL, you’re hurting your mother, she just wants to be a grandmother, she loses the will to live if grandchild is not in her life”

or anything else, we are firm that this is again trying to manipulate us and we will not up the contact, she will not see our child unsupervised ever nor will our child ever stay over there ^((after our announcement, I was barely 2 months pregnant, she was adamant that our child would be staying there ALL the time almost immediately after birth and she’d do all these grandmother-things with HER grandchild ( = taking over the mother’s role, because she would buy the first this, give LO the first that, do the first this with LO,…   It irritated me so much because dammit, I was barely pregnant and already felt like an incubator with her remarks. Shut that down there by clearly saying that won’t happen and I was a mean girl according to her and this is also how she spoke about me to my BIL’s, together with me being a gold-digger and other nice things (see history).))

Anyhow, either way joke’s on her, as LO has never stayed there, ever, no day nor night and has been sleeping over at my parents’ place for a few nights already as both myself and my SO trust my parents completely and had social outings we really did not want to miss. I know she knows this and it kills her. She has a one-sided competition with my parents, whom she met once in 5 years but can't stand that my SO has a much better relationship with them where he even goes out for a coffee with my mom separately from me, then he has ever had with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So... sorry for the long text and the might rambling part of it, but it's been a while since I posted, I wanted to give some background.

&amp;#x200B;

I need you guys to give me some steady, polite but firm comebacks to all these typical narc-MIL/e-FIL statements. I will need to keep that in the back of my mind as a mantra so I can remain calm and get my point across where she burned all bridges and only a very distant acquientance-like relationship can ever be from my family to her.

My SO is taking the lead here, he fully realizes he has failed me in the beginning of our parenthood-journey by being in the FOG and not protecting me after childbirth, and has self-improved so much, and knows we (LO and I) are his new family, we are supportive of him and all his endeavours in his career and life path and just because someone shares a blood bond, does not make them priority over your family or your boss in any form or way. His words are literally that we choose family and that negative people are not welcome in our life, no matter what form of or how many toddler like tantrums they throw.

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 1**: MIL is NOT, I repeat, NOT coming to our house. If it were to be some kind of trap and she tries to sneak in together with FIL, she will get no further than the door. She is not welcome in my house, not now, not ever. My house is my safe place. We think it's FIL working on his own, because he might want to still have a relationship with his son and grandchild BUT we are weary and think that the enabling part of him might just be too big. We have rocked the boat for too long and I think FIL wants to ""get us back in line"" by being the most lenient one of the 2 of them. But should it be a trap and MIL comes to our city/street, well, we do not negotiate with terrorists."
253,"Does anyone have an app they recommend to record phone conversations? My D(ear)H is struggling with sorting through the verbal diarrhea and inconsistencies of information his mom provides over the phone. He’s out of the fog, but has a terrible memory and also has a leftover tendency from childhood to shut down and miss critical pieces of information to just move on when she speaks. She’s also sneaky so he wants to be able to approach conversation with a fresh perspective and identify manipulation tactics once he’s had a break to process."
254,"I’m sorry for my English but I’m in Germany, my storie with my MIL is really complicated she is a raging alcoholic, I try to stay away from her because I’m struggling a lot with my mental health, since I got married I been extremely depressed because his family try to do everything to ruined our marriage, the latest stunt was yesterday morning around 6.30 am she came to our house open our door without knocking and stand in our bedroom screaming why we stole one of her pictures, I don’t even know what she meant with that (she was extremely drunk) I freakout and I scream back to her, she left crying and calling her daughter telling her we kick her out of the house when she want to surprise us with breakfast, her daughter call 20 minutes later telling me I’m a evil bitch! Honestly at this point I’m about to give up not just in my marriage I’m about to give up on myself they kick me to the ground making me feel like I’m insane for wanting to have my own family."
255,"Okay so originally, I posted a long post in another sub about my MIL on Friday and what happened when I told her we are pregnant. 

The TLDR version is basically, when we discussed plans for the baby, me not wanting to nurse but wanting to sleep train etc. she commented “you don’t want to do any of the things that make you a mother”

To top it off that night, she is a heavy smoker and I asked her to not smoke before leaving the restaurant,  since we were all in my brand new car (not even a week old), I’m pregnant and don’t want the secondhand smoke, and I’m asthmatic and she did it anyway. 

The full post is linked 

https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/dk2jak/my_mil_told_me_i_dont_want_to_mother/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

But moving on, my family had a dinner last night for my grandma’s 75th birthday and my parents invited my DH’s parents bc he is their only child and they really have no family. So basically I am still FUMING about what happened Friday night. My MIL says nothing to me at all, but she talks to my DH, whom she told that she didn’t care that I didn’t want her to smoke, and secondhand smoke isnt THAT bad for me to be around and I was being dramatic. 

Now instead of saying something to me, she then tells my mom the whole thing at dinner and plays the victim, saying I yelled at her and asked her to quit smoking on the spot. At this point I lose it, being pregnant and emotional right now... and I just start screaming. I ended up telling her she is disrespectful and rude and that she won’t be seeing her grandchild if she doesn’t quit smoking. She told me “I’m sorry you’re angry but I’m not sorry for smoking around you” and that point I really just lost it and told her I was her only
Source of grandchildren and that if it’s up to me she will have no parts in their life. Honestly, my MIL is making me wish we weren’t pregnant bc I already assume it’ll be a long 9 months.

As an aside, this woman is very toxic, my DH has really had to cut most connection with her, except seeing her &amp; my FIL once a week. My FIL is great, we have a great relationship. My MIL tends to be a manipulator and plays the victim when she does something wrong. In the past, she has called me inappropriate names like racial and sexual slurs, so our 6 year relationship has been bumpy. 

TLDR: Saturday things finally boiled over bc my MIL refuses to talk to me about problems she has with ME and we finally exploded. I told her she cannot see her grandchild if she chooses to smoke, and she will not be able to watch them. She ended up telling me she didn’t care and leaving dinner early."
256,"So MIL came over today as she does every (f\*\*king, another story) weekend and I had planned to be out of the house for most of the day. My plans went down the toilet and so I came home early and in a pretty crappy mood. I went into the kitchen to do some avoidance while she entertained the baby on the couch.

We have very few rules in our house concerning the baby:

1. Don't fall asleep with the baby (this rule is for everyone, myself and DH included)
2. Don't pick up the baby (this is MIL exclusive since she has balance issues)
3. Only feed the baby what we tell you to feed the baby

I'm sure you can see where this is going...

So, I'm in the kitchen and I hear the television stop playing baby songs. Odd, I think to myself, but maybe she is just finding a different video. A few minutes go by and there is still no sound from the room. No television, no talking, nothing. I go into the living room and there is MIL, with baby laying on her chest, sleeping on the couch.

I clear my throat and ask her if she fell asleep. She starts awake, looks around for a second, and tells me she was only resting her eyes. She wasn't really asleep. I tell her not to fall asleep with the baby. If she is tired, call one of us to put the baby in her bassinet. She does that ""you don't know what you are talking about"" sound with a little moue pout to her lips, like she isn't going to listen to me, and says OK. I told her, don't do that. When I tell you something about how to handle my child, I want you to listen to me and say yes without argument, and do what I tell you. Then she goes into the ""but I was only..."" and telling me how she had her hand under here and her fingers wrapped there so if the baby moved it would wake her up. I told her I didn't care what she had where, you don't sleep with the baby because even though she may have the best intentions, if the baby starts to slip no reflexes are good enough to catch her from a dead sleep. These are our rules and she needs to follow them. Then I turn and go back into the kitchen. This is over... right? RIGHT?

NOPE

I'm coming back out of the kitchen maybe a half hour later and she says she needs me to stop and look at her. I'm like, ookkkkkk.... Then she says, as she pats the couch across from her, that she needs me to come sit right here so she can have a talk with me. NOPE.

I don't move a muscle and ask what she wants to talk about. She won't say, only that she needs me to sit right where she tells me so she can discuss it. We go back and forth, I say she can either tell me or I'm leaving. Finally, with a pout, she tells me that I hurt her feelings and need to apologize because I was rude to her and I need to control my tone when I speak to her.

Teeth grinding.

I tell her that she knows she is not allowed to sleep with the baby and that I will speak to her in any tone I feel is necessary to convey my point in a way that will make her understand I am being serious.

Yes, but... but... and she argues with me about how she is mother and mother knows best and I need to be respectful. I notice out of the corner of my eye that DH has turned around and is assessing the situation. (If I had gone to sit on the couch he would have never heard us having this discussion)  She starts going on about how she loves the baby and would never do anything to hurt her and she can't believe I would insinuate such a thing, etc. Knowing I'm about to lose my shit because I only have so much patience for this BS, DH stands up, cuts her off, and tells her no one falls asleep with the baby. Tells her the argument is done, looks at me as if to ask if I agree and after a nod to him, I leave the room again.

Cue another hour of CBF and her glaring daggers at my head as I ignore her and do my own thing. As she is leaving she tries one more time to get DH on her side, saying I just don't understand because I don't know her 'mannerisms'. He tells her they are bad mannerisms and she needs to learn new ones.

We can never let our guard down because she will always see how far that line extends. As for picking up the baby, we tell her every time she comes over that she isn't allowed. Every single time she comes over she stands over the baby and reaches for her to pick her up. We always make her go sit down. Today she said she knows she can't WALK with the baby, but why can't she just STAND with the baby?

Feeding the baby. Ok, so she hasn't done this one yet. YET. But I'm waiting for it..."
257,"This is from years and years ago so there’s no need for advice, feel free to leave funny ass comments because those were cracking me up on my last post! Now, GMIL will probably be a frequent topic with me so I could use y’all’s help with a nickname~

Back story: me and FDH have been dating for six years. I’m 21 he’s 23. We’re both close to graduating college (FINALLY). And when it comes to these stories he always defends me from his family so he’s not in the fog, we are however, stuck with GMIL for a bit due to some help GFIL gave us (see last post). Okay onto first mini story!

When I first met my future in laws it was intimidating as fuck. I was 15, had only been dating FDH for about 3 weeks at this point. He’s the first guy I stuck with this long and he had also just kissed me and told me he loved me for the time a few days prior. Teenage emotions all over the place. He invites me to his family Christmas party, I said yes, was able to talk my crazy ass egg donor (story for another day with her) into letting me go, and boom show up to his families Christmas out in the country. Now, once I get there I realize how close knit his family is. This imitated the hell out of me because it’s something I wasn’t used to. FDH introduces me (as well as a 17 year old boy does lmao) and we go sit down. We eat, talk, had a great time. 

Now it was time for gifts. I had expected to just sit around and watch everyone open their presents and talk with FDH since like I said, we hadn’t even dated for a month and this is first time I’m meeting the family. Boy was I wrong. THESE. PEOPLE. BOUGHT. ME. GIFTS. YALL. It was so sweet, it was only three things but I was not expecting it at all. So I’m feeling hella welcomed at this point to were I finally feel okay enough to stop following FDH like a shadow. I go and sit to talk with his mom (FMIL), his grandmother (GMIL) and his aunts (FM1 &amp; FM2). Normal convo at first “what grade are you, how did you meet FDH, do y’all have classes together” typical questions you’d ask a high schooler. Then *dramatic music* GMIL opens her mouth “when do you think you’ll have kids?” *record scratch* 

wut. 

At this point FMIL is also uncomfortable. I just awkwardly laugh and mumble something about not wanting kids. The flying monkeys swoop in with their screachy voices. “You don’t want kids why not? Kids are amazing! Kids are the only way for you to experience true joy. FDH is the only one to carry on FGFIL’s name you HAVE to have children!!!!” (FDH was born before his parents married because he was a teen pregnancy therefor he has his mother’s maiden name and is the only grandchild to carry GFIL’s name. Not even his younger siblings have that name). 

Thankfully at this point FDH’s spidey senses were tingling and he swoops in to save me. I told him everything and after the party he had a long phone call to GMIL about what she said and how it made me feel. Thankfully I didn’t have to see anyone other than FMIL and his siblings for almost 6 months after that.

I didn’t realize how long this actually was so this will be part one. I will put up more though!!

Edit: spelling errors are a bitch"
258,"I promised old stories, so why not start at the beginning. In retrospect, very much in retrospect when I look back on my time with Pig Farmer, its actually not that hard to spot the first red flag. With that said, she seemed nice so my stupid ass ignored that bright red flappy fucker. 

To set the scene: DH had only introduced me to PF roughly 6 months before this, despite my having known him for 5+ years. PF lived an hour and a half to two hours away. He saw her very rarely, in part due to the big ass rift between them that she'd caused by stealing his college fund and spending it on convertible Mustangs and cruises. With that said, she'd apologized and he felt she'd genuinely changed and decided to give her a chance. We had a very casual but friendly enough relationship with PF and SFIL. We ate dinner together once every couple of months. DH wasn't a big fan of SFIL (who was a JNo all by himself), but we all got along well enough as adults. 

Now SFIL was a serial cheater. I bring this up because it was an ongoing and well-known shitshow. PF was wife #4. He had cheated on all his wives. PF was not his one true love whose loving and forgiving presence kept him monogamous. She got exactly what you'd expect to get when you marry a serial cheater. Remember that whole Ashley Madison hacker scandal? Guess whose name was on that list? If you guessed SFIL, have a cookie.

So, we knew PF and SFIL had issues. They'd always had marital issues, per DH. They hid the issues when we were around and we pretended we didn't know he kept sticking his weenie in women who weren't PF. All was good. 

Until one night we get a phone call from a strange number that turns out to be the county fucking jail in Pig Farmer's county. Its Pig Farmer, calling drunk from the county jail.

Mind you, we knew all about Pig Farmer's criminal record, but SFIL was law enforcement so we assumed that she was pretty firmly on the straight and narrow. 

We couldn't accept the call because Straighttalk wouldn't let us do a collect call. DH tries to get a hold of SFIL, nope, cant reach him either.

Make a few more phone calls and slowly over the next few hours, the story comes out. SFIL and PF go to a party/cookout. SFIL and PF get stupid drunk. SFIL  puts his weenie somewhere it doesn't belong. Pig Farmer slaps the shit out of him. Shit progresses. Someone calls the cops. Now we're all hanging out down at county lockup, trying to get our only adult kid to come bail us out. 

DH and I were broke. SFIL and PF weren't allowed contact with each other. They wanted us to access their bank accounts and come spring them from the pokey. DH can't miss work, so he tells them they'll have to sit 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, neither of them is good with this plan, so they find friends to bail them out. 

We assume it's over, but it's not. No charges are pressed against SFIL. He's law enforcement with connections. Charges are pressed against PF for domestic abuse of SFIL, they stick bc she's already a felon. They stay together, because the whole relationship is a shitshow and they both seem to feed on drama, but PF winds up court ordered into AA and placed on a year's probation.

And that, folks, is what an enormous red flag looks like when dealing with JN-in-laws. Today's lesson of the day: If they start calling you from jail, you should run, don't walk, to NC-land. Nothing good comes from the type of MIL who calls from jail and asks you for bail money. Also, if the judge court orders your MIL into AA, consider that a BIG RED FLAG. 

We should have put the brakes on the relationship then and there. I mean, seriously, I wish we had. Instead, we accepted their apologies and even felt kinda sorry for PF since she got both cheated on and probation while SFIL just got slapped by weak, chubby chick. We even kinda tried to be supportive and there for her since she was struggling so badly with the whole situation. 

SFIL, for the record, continued cheating until literally the day he died. His almost brand new computer was gifted to me after his death and it had all kinds of dating profiles and correspondence on it. His girlfriend was pretty ballsy. She showed up at his funeral, where neither PF or ex-wife #3 (step-kiddos mom) was overly amused to see her. Total shitshow. We genuinely felt really bad for PF because of all this, especially since monogamy was definitely not an issue on her part. I think it was part of why we let our guards down. We felt bad for her, and we'd live to regret that. 


Next time on The Adventures of Pig Farmer: The Hellcation."
259,"Second time posting about futureMIL. First post you all confirmed she is a JustNo. Here we go...

Future DH still lives with his parents paying them rent because the cost of living in our city is too high for either of us to move out. Their house constantly has things breaking and they never pay to fix any of it. Instead they are spending over $12,000 to go to Disney. Anyway, last year their water pump broke and resulted in them running out of water in ~30 seconds. Future DH was showering with a hose in his yard in the middle of winter (not sure how the hose worked but not the shower?). MIL and FIL refused to fix it or accept money from future DH to pay someone. Stating “FIL and his dad will fix it in a few weeks”. When my parents heard about this my dad (handyman) fixed the water pump and taught future DH how to do it should it break again. This was done when MIL &amp;amp; FIL were away for the week as to not intrude or embarrass them (notice they go on a trip instead of fixing the water 🙄)DH thanked my dad and took him out for lunch. MIL and FIL never mentioned a thing even after DH explained that my a Dad taught him how to fix it.

Fast forward to this summer. They saved $12000 to go to Disney. Going above and beyond on all expenses. Then their AC broke during the hottest month of the year. Future FIL and DH wanted it fixed ASAP because they both work 12-14 hour days and it was 40 degrees Celsius. MIL disagreed because she has a window AC in her bedroom and said everyone else could just use fans. Plus she didn’t want to have to “cut back on her Disney trip.” My parents own an HVAC company and my elderly dad offered to come over after work (40 degrees out) to check out the AC and try to fix it for FREE. Turns out the AC needed a new part. My dad offered to install it for cost of the part. Of course all the while my dad was checking it out MIL and FIL never came outside to say hi or offer a drink. Future DH helped my dad while MIL and FIL watched TV inside. The next day MIL says to me “why didn’t your Dad come in and say hi??? We have never got to meet him!” I replied “SORRY MIL but you never invited him in and he didn’t want to intrude while you watched your show!” She said nothing and made a sour face. They never paid for the part and ended up contacting another company to get a quote for entirely new AC but never went through with the purchase. Hurts that they went to another company. Hurts more that they never thanked my Dad for the free service call after he worked all day outside on rooftops. Also, my poor SO works a labour job and had a very hot uncomfortable place to come home to all summer. Especially because MIL and SIL would take all the fans for themselves at night. Not sure what future DH is paying rent for? Their Disney trip I guess 🤷‍♀️


TL;DR: MIL is selfish and bad with money. Charges DH rent but doesn’t do the bare minimum home maintenance. Ungrateful to my father for doing free repairs on her home."
260,"One of the other posters had a serious situation with her herpified MIL and valid concern for her newborn and MIL being too stupid to not kiss LO. My story is similar but it’s the JN who gets the herpes thanks to the “I should be able to kiss who I want in the fammmilllyy” attitude. 

So I’m the one who gets cold sores (thanks to my own grandmother giving me a kiss as a kid - not a baby and it was before there were news stories about it being contagious -and way before the internet - I’m old)

When one of my kids was born the physical stress of labor caused me to breakout with a cold sore (by then we knew about being contagious, so  I didn’t kiss kiddo - and I don’t much now because I’m paranoid about passing it along)

My JNMom had to get right in my face and kiss me multiple times even though she knew I hated it (and she always had dragon breath). Well the cold sore fairy started visiting her after that. Moral of the story, keep your kisses to yourself b*tch."
261,"Since i have seen a few of the costume posts here is mine which is a little on going.

Dd is 6.5 months old and halloween is my favorite holiday. I had all intentions of having her be a black cat or a witch, but when my dad passed she became a butterfly and i mother nature (a dress representing my dad) it kinda worked well as we all loved halloween growing up and this is my first year without him.

Everytime i see mil and i talk about how i love halloween she would suggest dd just wear what my niblings wore. One was a prisoner (i am an leo so not a big fan of it) and i think the other was a dinosaur. I shot that down right away. She brought it up 3 more times. Dh finally said something and it would be done.

When i saw my sil i said how i was excited for halloween. She asked of i got a costume yet and i declared dd was a butterfly and i got a great deal on the price(some of those outfits are pricey even for babies) she suggested i just have dd dress up in her sons prisoner outfit and i should just wear my work uniform. I legit just turned around ""i think i hear dd crying."" 

If you see my history the whole borrowing their stuff and not buying stuff of my own is an on going thing so this was just annoying. Needless to say dd is a damn butterfly, i am wearing a sunflower dresa, skull leggings and a flower crown. My house is not a jail. Nothing major just annoying.

Edit: leo as in law enforcement officer. Haha :) your not the only one who was confused."
262,"Well, she did it. She fucking did it. She showed up with a gift. 

The best part is that she waited until my brother and DH were there to give it to Kiddo. JNM had all morning alone with my kids. It would have been a prime time to give it to Kiddo. Then we sat around in the afternoon watching football while DH napped. Oh no. She waited all fucking day and gave it to Kiddo late in the evening when we came back from dinner. 

I’m so fucking furious still this morning. Like, angry tears over it. Like, I cannot even properly recall the whole conversation because I was so pissed off. It basically devolved into “It’s just a puzzle. It barely takes up any space. You can just throw it away when I leave then.” RAGE. Books don’t take up much space either and I also said no to those. She made me pissed off and I was arguing in front of Kiddo, which I absolutely despise doing. And Kiddo is at the stage where they remember every stupid toy received- I’m not punishing them for JNM’s boundary stomping by throwing away something new that they enjoy playing with. 

Honestly, I want to not go visit at Christmas after this. I’m seriously that mad about it. DH most likely won’t let me cancel that trip though (even though it would save us a couple hundred on a car rental) because he has a faaaaammmily problem. I’m thinking I don’t let her visit for several months more than usual. When she asks why, I’ll tell her it’s because I can’t trust that she won’t bring another gift. I don’t know. I’m already pretty LC with her. She rarely gets to video call the kids, I don’t usually send pictures, and I personally only talk to her on the phone maybe once a month unless a trip is coming up. I have no idea what much more I can do to force this boundary. 

All over a fucking puzzle."
263,"I know it’s a waste of time to think this way but l just would love to have a second set of family. I have no relationship with my ILs.

It’s tough raising a young family these days and l would love to have a MIL or ILs to be part of my family.
To share and feel like the care about us. To help each other out. Dare l say to babysit sometimes.

My ILs have no interest in me or my kids. They live on another Country but never call or ask for photos, they have never messaged on my kids birthdays.

It makes me a little sad sometimes"
264,"My mom did this. I wanted my son to be a hobbit for Halloween last year, instead, he trick or treats as a Dalmatian. I hate Dalmatians. She knows this. 

This year, she started telling me that she had his costume all picked out already. Conversation went like this.

Mom: I picked his costume out already! He’s going to be so cute as ________!!

Me: he’s not going to be ________. 

Mom: what are you talking about, of course he is. We agreed already! (No we didn’t. She talked, I ignored.)

Me: you picked his costume out last year without talking to me. So I didn’t get to get my kids first costume. You’re not doing that this year.

Mom: you’re depriving me of being a grandma.

Me: that’s bullshit. You’re not getting his costume. Not this year. I’ll dress him as a demon if I want to.


Incidentally, he’s going to be Binx, I’m going to be winifred Sanderson and my husband is going to be Max from Hocus Pocus. 

She’s going to hate it and I shall love it."
265,"Venting, ranting, I don’t even know.

We had a party today for my LOs cousin on my husbands side, meaning all of the in-laws were there. I am beginning to realize that I have postpartum anxiety, and that certain situations heighten it even more. Firstly, this party was going to have at least 50 people, which I was thinking would overwhelm my son. Secondly, of course, was the fact that my crazy MIL was going to be there.

The in-laws were an hour late so at least we had some time to play with the other kids uninterrupted. The second they arrive, she made a beeline straight to me and my son and gets about an inch from his face and starts her crazy loud baby talk. My son is starting to get worried and wraps his arms tightly around me. “Oh, he doesn’t even know me. He needs to know his grandma,” she starts with this immediately.

Next, she follows us around everywhere I try to take him. Always trying to touch him, literally nonstop trying to touch him while I’m holding him and he’s trying to squirm away from her. She’s constantly tickling his neck and touching his hands and feet. And still doing the obnoxiously loud baby talk at him.

She starts questioning me on why he is never wearing any of the hats she knitted him. We live in the South. It’s still at least 85 degrees most days. Why in the hell would I be making my kid wear hats? I don’t even put a shirt on him when we’re home because it’s so hot. She gets all offended and has CBF when I tell her no, it’s too hot right now for hats. She has asked me about these damn hats every single time I’ve seen her since his birth.

I finally sneak away from her so I can get my son to nap. We had now been at the party for 2 hours and one full hour was MIL hour. We didn’t get to take any pictures with the birthday kid because of how much she was demanding my sons attention. I walked outside alone wearing him in the baby carrier and he fell asleep. I managed to get my husband to come alone with me so we snuck around to a private room/storage area where it was quiet. MIL must’ve been watching us somehow because the moment we sit down to let my son nap, she comes barging in. Loud AF, “WHERE IS MY GRANDSON, THIS IS A PARTY, WHY IS HE ASLEEP, WHY ARE YOU ALL HIDING IN HERE.”

I know you guys understand how bad things can get it your babies get overtired, so I was mad. I got up and walked directly away from her across the entire venue and straight to my car so my kid could sleep in peace. After feeding and changing him, I walk back into the venue and it’s time for cake.

MIL starts screeching, “Give him to me! You need to go eat cake. I promise I won’t kiss him. Just hand him over.” My eyes have never rolled so far to the back of my head. The truth is, I am totally over people kissing him. The kid eats dog food and plays in the toilet water now... I really don’t think kissing is worse than that. The problem I have is how she repeatedly does things we ask her not to, ex. kissing ever since he was born (re: every post I’ve written on this sub). 

Whatever, I have all extended in-law family sitting here and I don’t want to look like a total bitch, so I hand him over. Well, this super-obese (not exaggerating) woman almost drops my 8 month old baby on the floor.... Another reason I do not like her taking him from me. The only way she can hold him properly is by sitting him on top of her enormous boobs. Her stomach gets in the way and her arms are too short to hold him any other way. Husband is sitting there so he helps but she keeps insisting that she’s got a hold of him.

I have a mini anxiety attack as I walk away from my child with this woman to go get my cake. When I come back, she’s literally kissing all over his face and stops the second she sees me. I’m raging inside but I chose not to say anything because the whole family (uncles, cousins, aunts, etc) is sitting at the same table. She puts my son up on the table and holds him under his armpits. She didn’t realize his leg was stuck between her stomach and the table so he starts screaming. I go to grab him from her and she flings him up and back into her boobs. Yes, flings, like whips him through the air.

“He’s fine, he just wants grandma to hold him close! Sit down, go over there and eat. I’ve got him.” Y’all I don’t even want to know what my face looked like at this point. As to not make a scene, I say, “No, I think he’s done over here. He’s probably bored and all the other kids are playing. I’m taking him over there so he can socialize with the other kids.” She is fuming and muttering under her breath but I just take him and go across the room with him.

Now, as I sit on the floor at a children’s party while my child plays with other children, I have a stream of in-laws come to me and ask me why MIL can’t hold my son... Why the hell does my son need to spend the entire party being held or being expected to be entertaining my MIL? Why can’t he sit and play with other kids? Why is everything always about her!? My DH(dumbass at this point) is sitting there with his cousins oblivious that his entire family is coming at me right now. I just respond back, “She was just holding him, he needs to socialize with some other kids, too.” And they all keep going on and on that I am a helicopter mom, etc.

I really don’t understand why people feel entitled to my child. The only people who have a right to him are me and my husband. And my husband wasn’t really thrilled about his mother waddling after us the entire party. But of course, he said nothing.

When it’s time to leave, MIL comes rushing at us yet again and tries to grab my son from me. “Don’t you wanna come with grandma!? You want grandma!” She’s practically screaming at him. He starts crying, ha ha. “Oh you’re crying because mommy won’t let grandma hold you.” Does this make anyone else’s blood boil?

She starts blowing him kisses and touching his nose after every time. My DH is taking forever to get going because he’s talking to his cousins, so I just tell her I have to go feed him in the car and she literally stands outside the door waiting. Luckily my husband finally comes and tells her she’s acting weird (since I’m breastfeeding and she’s basically standing there watching from outside the car), and they say goodbye. So at least I made it out of there without having to give my fake hug goodbye to her.

I am dreading the upcoming holidays. Obviously she’s now complaining to the entire family that I’m not letting her do anything with her only grandchild. We can’t even enjoy ourselves at a family function without her being up my ass the whole time. When I put him in the baby carrier, she still insists on following us around and touching any part of him that is sticking out of the carrier. I really don’t want to cross the line and just be blunt and rude towards her, but I feel like I may need to."
266,"This is a rant.  Maybe?

My husband cosigned a loan for my mother in law last year (2018) ,and I have no control over it.  

He warned me himself I would hate the idea.  I don't want to control him but holy fuck what do I do?

We're floundering now and he just made a call to her detailing why we suffer.  I don't know if she's willing to let her grandchildren hurt but she did tell me once she let my husband suffer when she though his playing in cabinets was shameful.

She took pictures of him to shame him into ""behaving"".  He was five years old.  

What do I do?"
267,"Back in July, SO’s grandmother had what we thought was a stroke. This was after an interrogation from FMIL &amp; FFIL and after I went to tell FMIL what they did (pretty much just her) was not okay in anyway shape or form. She commandeered the conversation, I feel for the bait, and called her a name. Her ego is so fragile she couldn’t take being call a bitch WHEN SHE WAS BEING A TOTAL BITCH. It’s funny, because she always has to be the smartest, toughest person in the room. Anyway, she basically NCed herself and the rest of the family from us. Worked out great. 

Anyway, so GMIL has what we thought was a stoke. FMIL flew up to her, left her husband to take care of the 5 kids 4yo-18yo by himself for more than a month. While I don’t doubt GMIL needed it, she made FFIL do the whole “back to school” gig all by himself. Now, parenting is supposed to be split 50/50, from my observation literally growing up with this family always around, dad didn’t handle the education side at all. It was her territory and he wasn’t touching it. So boom, he gets sucker punched with all of that. Meanwhile, he’s trying to figure out how to mend the relationship between them and us. 

Eventually FMIL brings GMIL down to care for her. She was upset that GMIL wasn’t on Medicare because now she can’t get paid for being her caretaker. WHAT. THIS IS YOUR MOTHER. Obviously, there is reason to be upset as GMIL is older and doesn’t have any health insurance to help cover the cost of medical care, but why would getting paid to be a caretaker even be in you mind?!?! FYI, they don’t need both parents working, so it’s not like she is needing to work and is missing out on it taking care of GMIL, this is literally just side/extra money she is trying to get at. 

When we saw them after church the day after she got back with GMIL, FFIL was trying to talk to us as FMIL loaded the kids and GMIL in the car. We didn’t get a chance to even say hello- nonetheless, finally get to introduce GMIL to our baby. At this point, GMIL health has started deteriorating more, and she went mostly blind the day before. A selfish part of me got really sad at this because I had the though of, “wow. The one person on that side of the family that would have absolutely loved my wedding dress in now the one person that won’t be able to see it.” A great deal of that come from the fact that when I did a dress reveal with my bridesmaids, and FMIL, FMIL was SO INSULTING. She had a disgusted look on her face, didn’t say one nice thing about anything, and then proceeded to tell me how I could alter it to make it “look better. She piss all of the bridesmaids off AND the ladies in the boutique, all of which were there the day I found the dress. 

Back to the story: when FMIL was getting into the car, she didn’t even look at me, and when she looked at SO, she glared at him in a way that only could be described as a death glare as if he was dead to her. All this, right before me bridal shower. Yay! Obvi, she didn’t go, neither did her daughter that at the time, was a bridesmaid. Or the other daughters that were our flower girls. Yay yay yay!!!

Fast forward, GMIL health is literally spiraling. What they though was a stroke was misdiagnosed, and it is likely brain cancer as she has lesions all over her brain. SO heart is literally breaking at the fact that he hasn’t gotten to see her in the month she has been here. And the only way we can see her? If we go to their house. 

I’m not going to live regretting that we never saw GMIL before she passed. She was alway so loving and kind to her grandchildren and me. When we were dating/older, I’d always have meaningful conversations that I’ll always cherish with her. I’d like to at least let my daughter have some pictures to look back on with her and her great-grandmother. 

Both FFIL and FMIL are under the impression we are going to sit down and talk to them to “sort things out.” Long story short, I sent an apology email, as FMIL didn’t want to meet us in person, for calling her a bitch. They think we are bowing down to them, and in reality, are hands are clean, that’s all that matters to us. In both the conversation I had one on one with FMIL and a later one both SO and I had with FFIL, we have drawn the conclusion neither of them really want to take responsibility for what they’ve done and the boundaries they crossed. FFIL is more receptive to this ON HIS OWN, but I doubt they will listen and respect our boundaries. So that conversation will happen, so we can say, “sorry, you don’t respect us. Until you want to, you won’t be a part of our lives.” For now, we are focused on the wedding in three weeks, and visiting with GMIL. 

I know that sounds crazy, but again, we are going to go visit her, and tell them sternly that is the only reason we are there. The second they try to turn it into something about them, we are going to leave. Hopefully that will happen after we have time to visit with GMIL. I’m sure some of y’all will say don’t go, and I understand why. But, if anyone wants to throw in some tips about saying LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE so we can visit with our dying GMIL, I would defiantly appreciate that 👌🏻"
268,"I’m new to reddit so bare with me. My boyfriend and I started off as a long distance couple. The few times I met his parents were short yet sweet. They would often offer their home to me, if I decided to move to my boyfriends hometown. Eventually I made the move and took them up on their offer. That is when things really took a turn for the worst. Initially, I was given the basement to live in. It was a finished basement with nothing but a bed in the center. There was talk between my boyfriend and his dad about putting a tv down there and such. So when we went to buy a tv and tv stand I didn’t think anything of it other than it was already discussed and okay. I had unpacked my stuff and tried to “settle in” a bit like one would do when moving into a new space. Not even a week into living there we came home one night to her sitting in the kitchen, tears in her eyes, demanding it was time we all had a talk. She had a total meltdown that her basement had been changed without her knowledge. While I totally agree that she should’ve been asked and included in the process, 1. the tantrum and tears was completely unnecessary and 2. I was under the impression that it was already discussed and okayed. Why this was all directed at me and not her son is beyond me. Not once did she direct the conversation towards him, like it was all my fault. She also demanded we be home for dinner every night, that he sleeps upstairs in his room, we must go to every family function, we were not aloud to come into the house through the garage door and other weird and controlling commands for 2 adults. 

My experience with her only got worse. She would walk in on me while I was changing and would refuse to leave the room because it was her house (private parts out and all) . She would take down my personal items and replace them with her decorations. She would go off on me, saying my parents did a horrible job raising me, I had no manners etc. I would offer to cook for the family, cleaned up after myself.. I carried my own weight while living there but it was never enough. There was always a problem. My breaking point (my boyfriends too) was when she resorted to taking a hammer to his car windows. We had plans to run errands after he got home from work. As soon as he gets home she demands that he lets her use his car despite her perfectly good car sitting in the driveway. He says no I need it I have things to do but she would not take no for an answer. I’m in the car waiting for him to get in when I hear yelling, followed by her walking towards the car with a hammer. Yes, she went at it with me sitting right there in the passenger seat and yes I took videos as she was doing it. 

After that I just couldn’t stay. She had totally lost it. I packed my stuff and got the hell out of there and didn’t speak to his family for a year. Despite him still living there he basically went no contact with them and spent all holidays with my family and I. Fast forward to last year.. I moved back but into our apartment. We still weren’t talking to his family until January of this year, when I decided maybe it was time for forgive and move on. He had a talk with them and cleared the air. I decided not to go last minute because I was still a bit too anxious to see her. To this day she has not apologized for how she treated me but at this point i’ve accepted that she likely never will. Anyways, we start seeing them often and it was like she had a change of heart. She was sooo nice. Having us over for dinner, inviting us to go out, always bubbly and excited to see us etc. But slowly she started going back to her old ways. A little more controlling, a little more opinionated.. so on. 

Our apartment is under construction so we had no other option but to stay with them. It was supposed to be for a weekend but insurance wouldn’t cover a hotel so it turned into a month. Now going on almost 2. It was bad from the get go. This woman has no hospitality and does not care if her guests are comfortable. She only cares about what is best for her. On an 85 degree day she refused to turn the air on because she was cold. We have 2 dogs that we are “doing the worst job training” says the woman who had never owned a pet in her life. She has gone against every rule we set for our dogs and has completely destroyed all progress the dogs has made.  We decided it had gotten out of hand and politely asked her to respect how we raise our pets and explained to her why it was important to us that they have structure. She started crying and ran to her room. Her husband’s defense was “its hard for her to not treat the dogs like babies. that’s just how she is. it’s like taking candy from a baby”. This woman is in her 50s... One day i caught her doing something with the dogs we asked her not to do, nicely reminded her the rule we had set and took the dog from her. Her response was to scream at me “jesus fucking christ it’s not a big deal! jesus fucking christ” and she said it over and over again. Then she started breathing deep and fast like she was possessed. I was extremely frightened and ran upstairs and hid in our room. Later on she turned it around on me. She said she didn’t scream at me and that i was “malicious”.  Basically just lied to the whole family about what happened and then exaggerated on top of it. 

Her gift to my boyfriend for his birthday was throwing him a birthday party. She said she was tired and would like us to plan it all. Except the moment we tried she shot down every idea. She turned her nose up at the food he wanted. Spent half the budget on things she wanted for the party. Went and got the cake she wanted to get right after me telling her the cake we planned on getting. At one point i wondered why she told us to plan it if she was going to take over and over rule every idea we had. Planning it was such a nightmare that we could not wait for it to be over. 

Staying here has been like history repeating itself. The longer we’re here the worse she gets. There are a million other things she’s done but i obviously cannot list them all. My main worry is that it will get worse. She is a narcissist, she gas lights, she’s controlling. From what I’ve read, it only gets worse. Right now I feel it is mild because we’re not married and she may think i’m replaceable. But im afraid she has set the tone for the future. I can already see our wedding being a nightmare. If we can’t raise our dogs right then i’m sure how we raise our kids will be 10 times worse. As far as i’m concerned, she will never like me because i don’t give into her games. I don’t baby her, i don’t let her control me. I use the grey rock method and it drives her insane. I know these things might seem insignificant to what other people on here are dealing with but like i said, i’m really worried it will get worse once there’s a ring on my finger. So i’m trying to prepare myself for what’s coming as well as deal with what’s going on right now. 

One last thing. It’s important to note that my boyfriend 100% thinks she is crazy. It took him awhile to stand up for both of us but he is working at it and getting better. He does not agree with her behavior whatsoever and is nearly ready to go no contact."
269,"I posted here about my grandbaby obsessed JNMIL, thank you for the advice everyone. My dh and I agreed that we would come up with a plan and go to therapy. We also agreed that dh would confront JNMIL with me present.

We made a plan, both write out our goals for what we want boundaries to look like and what we would do if they were not respected, I really felt like he listened to me and realized he needs to take this role with his mom.  Spent the morning coming up with shared boundaries and emphasizing us being a unit.

Dh called mih to ask if we can talk to her, she replied that ""if your wife wants to talk about 'the thing' then I dint have energy"" ( note the 'thing' is her obsessive need for me to bear her grandbabies detailed In my past post.) 

I was proud  of dh he's  told her, I am going to talk to you about this before we continue on with our relationship, so it's now or the next time I see you ' then Mil agrees to talk, but says "" I haven't had my feelings heard"" and starts crying.

I'm in for a wild ride, tips welcome. I know I gotta stay cool, but I can get spicy."
270,"Husband and I have been married for 20 years, we’re both 40.

We’ve always wanted children but wanted to have a life before, which we’ve had and have been planning on having a baby the last 3 years.

I’m now 7 weeks pregnant (yay) hubby was thrilled too

Hubby went over to MILs home a week ago and then today he finally told me (after acting sh^t with me the whole week) that my MIL wants me to terminate my baby, her granddaughter.

He’s unsure on what he wants anymore and he’s either talking to me about termination or buying baby things

IDK what to do?"
271,"So let's do the update first.

We (me, dh and kiddos) were sitting at home planning our gingerbread mayhem and selecting cookie recipes for the gift boxes for the holidays. 
As were sitting at the table making holiday war plans- stepmil shows up.

She calls and no one answers. She bangs on the door no one answers. Yes were watching as she goes from door to window harassing us.

What does my lovely DH do? Why he had called the police when she first drove up.

What do the police see when they pull up? A woman trying to open windows of a house she does not live in.

Guess who has gotten trespassed from my house? Also warned the next time she tries that kind of stunt she will be arrested for attempting to break in.  

She was furious! The street tantrum she threw was amazing to include foot stomping, throwing her purse and every curse word in the book.

So me and the kids sat munched in some treats and enjoyed the show.
While my DH stood there strong and silent, filling out the paperwork for criminal trespassing.

What she wanted? Who knows, we don't care.

272,"The last two Christmases I have spent with DH family. The first one was awful. I had the flu, his mother insisted I went to the restaurant dinner and around to her sister's house afterwards. I was exhausted from working until the day before and had a fever and had her insisting it wasn't flu but a cold. She always has to diminish anything I experience. Drives me nuts.

Last year I swore I wouldn't do it again, had a dream Christmas planned with my best friends and horses and DH manipulated me into cancelling my plans and join him with his family. It was a shit show. I spent from 10am till 2am with his horrendous family, I was sick again (Think I'm allergic to his family), DH was manipulated into cooking so I didn't see him at all, I couldn't escape anywhere to try and crash out and sleep. All the while all the normal fun back handed comments I've grown to cherish.

He promised after that crap shoot it was my turn this year. I reminded him, he sulked a bit, but then actually turned it around. He apologised and said he was scared of dealing with JNMIL and JNGMIL.

Well today he told them that we are going away for Christmas on our own for a few days as it's the only time he can take a holiday trip this year as his work is closed over the holiday period and he doesn't want to lose shifts by taking time off at another time. His parents and brother and his girlfriend make multiple luxury trips a year, which is fine but we don't as we can't afford it. By the time Christmas comes round the two of us are exhausted and then we end up doing all the Christmas prep and cooking and cleaning etc. So more work, while his lazy family goes to the pub, watches tv etc.

 His dad was alright about it, but his mum kicked off. I had my back turned and was washing up and she screeched and wailed that it wasn't normal, that it was obvious we didn't want to be with them...etc etc. No emotional intelligence that past few Christmases have been nothing but work for the two of us, and that they haven't even bothered to try and include me at all. (Had it at his Aunts and I'm incredibly allergic to their pets, half the food being cooked with ingredients I'm intolerant to, shooting me down when I ask to include some traditions important to me, not allowing time for me to be able to skype my own family on Christmas day etc etc)

I'm from another country, not once has she appreciated that I must miss my own family, or let me bring any of my own traditions or foods to the event. It's all about her and what she wants. So not very fun for anyone else that isn't her golden child.

DH then had to go to sport practice after he dropped the news, so I hid in our room with no lunch or water for 4 hours until she left to go to work. 

Dreading seeing her. She yells and shrieks and cannot be reasoned with, and we live with her (Cannot move now due to financial issues)

Sometimes even though I adore my partner, his family makes me wonder if getting married and tying this band of nitwits to me for life is a good idea.

Advice, how do I deal with her? If she corners me alone, if she addresses us both and yells to try and embarrass us in front of other people etc?

Partner is out with friends and has decided to stay over with his friend. I'm fuming. I know he's trying to process it, but jesus."
273,"I'm vvvvlc with my bitch of an egg donor. The only time I have contact with her is when we meet up at family events. Today was such an event. In the past I would just listen to her malicious comments and ignore it, but not today Satan! I have absolutely had it with her telling lies about others behind their back.

As usual she started bitching as soon as she got me alone about how SIL never looks after grandchild and makes her GC son do all the work. The actual truth is that SIL works long hours in the middle of the city and GC bro makes his own hours and works from home most of the time!

This time I was ready though! I might have stumbled over my words with the first sentence, but I recovered and asked her why she would say such nasty things about someone who's really the best thing to ever happen to my brother. She DEFINITELY didn't expect it. She started spluttering through her CBF while I just shook my head and left her sitting alone. A short while later she cornered me again and tried to play victim about me not wanting to listen to her 'true' story and GC son told her it himself and how can I be so nasty to her? So I told her that she's always the victim and that I've had it with her lies. More CBF and she left me alone after that."
274,"So I hate my MIL.  She hates me.  We have been NC for years.  What’s the issue you say?  DH still talks to her.  It start after I had my DD and said no visitors.  I’m exhausted.  I want no one here.  So JNMIL shows up at the hospital.  I had severe PPD that started hours after giving birth and I lost it.   
   Fast forward years later.  We have been NC since DS was born five years ago.  JNMIL takes my now 7 yo DD for her birthday for some grandma time.  During this grandma time she asked DD “does your mom talk shit about me?” TO MY 7 YO.  
  This woman has never respected me or my boundaries.   And now she is trying to manipulate my kids.  So I tell DH after DD tells me she said this.  He is pissed.  He confronts her. She is so sorry and should not have said it.   Blah blah blah.   F*** you JNMIL.  So I told DH she is never seeing my kids again. He agreed.   Tonight he tells me that he was hoping I would change my mind and that the kids could go for Christmas Eve since he would be there.  Am I freaking nuts for not wanting them to go?  She is horrid.   She forgot my son  twice at school when he was 5.  That started the rift.  Because she always treated my son from a previous marriage different.  Am I insane?  I do not like her.  I trust her even less than that.  Grrrrr.   Thank you for listening."
275,"So my son is a year old now so this Halloween will be his second Halloween. 

His first halloween, he was two months and I was super excited to dress him up as Toad, from Mario. However, my MIL completely sidetracked me by buying a costume for MY son and demanded he wear it. I was still two months postpartum with depression and anxiety so I gave in to it even though I was extremely disappointed and let my SO know.

Come October, I let my MIL know that I’m going to dress up MY SON because I didn’t get to the first time, which was super upsetting because it was his first Halloween. She agrees with me so we go searching for costumes. 

She completely disregards costumes I LIKE and talks about costumes she likes and thinks that are cute. I still get DS the costume I wanted and all she can do is make snide remarks about he looks cute in his pumpkin costume BUT he would look cuter in other costume.

I’m super annoyed at this point until she called me today, demanding that I have DS wear another costume on Halloween because that is what she did with DH. Honestly, I wouldn’t mind it, but the fact that I feel she’s trying to get her way and undermine me makes me just want to outright tell her no, he’s only going to be what I WANT. 

Am I wrong for arguing over a costume?

BTW when she called me, she said she told DH to tell me that he (DS) should wear two costumes but DH has not told me anything, so I’m under the impression that she thinks if DH says yes to it, I must say yes. 

Gosh I’m extremely annoyed and I feel dumb for even being annoyed by this woman."
276,"So Miss Demeanor is in an uncomfortably fast paced relationship with her newest ex-felon. Long story short, he moved in the day DH moved out back in June; Literally, Miss Demeanor could not help DH move because she was in her boyfriends hometown getting his things, unbeknownst to us until we dropped by the next day while they were gone and found all of this guy’s stuff in the living room. They had been unofficially dating for a month when this happened. He had already been living there anyway, just not moved in. 
Anyway, Miss Demeanor has previously stated that in future relationships she’s looking for people that are either childless or have older children with only partial custody. In other words, she doesn’t want to be a mom or a “mother figure” again (I think this boils down to her need to relive her younger years since she was a young mother and didn’t get to enjoy them like she had hoped, but that’s just my theory). So you can imagine our surprise when we found out that MILBF has two kids, 11 and 4. We’ve pointed this out to her, as if it’s not obvious, and she made a bunch of excuses about how he only had supervised visitation at the time and always had to go back to his hometown to visit them, so it wouldn’t affect her, etc.
Well, surprise surprise, MILBF finished his parole and therefore got unsupervised custody of his kids. Still not a problem according to Miss Demeanor, because he can’t take them over state lines and still has to go back to his hometown on weekends with his kids. But he’s talking to us about bringing his kids to Miss Demeanor’s house, something she explicitly told us she wasn’t comfortable with? No no, they’re not planning on doing that for a LONG time, Miss Demeanor says. (There was an attempt at a break up sometime during all of this, but within days Miss Demeanor was still bringing him to family dinners and such. We never really got an explanation for that.)
Lo and behold, Miss Demeanor called DH just an hour ago to inform him that MILBF’s kids are at her house. They took them to the local pumpkin patch earlier today; the youngest one wants to take a bubble bath in Miss Demeanor’s jacuzzi bathtub, she says. I can almost hear her attempt to sound excited to mask the mild stress response this likely brings. Honestly, this is entertaining. I feel a nervous breakdown from Miss Demeanor on the horizon. We warned her this would come. She’s made her bed, now she’ll lay in it.
Also, I have to wonder; what happened to MILBF not being able to take these kids across state lines? Does their mother know about this? Is this legal? Will Miss Demeanor also be in trouble if this is illegal and MILBF gets caught in the act? I don’t know, but I can’t wait to find out."
277,"My ""lovely"" MIL cannot figure out that we are going to move away, despite the fact that we've told her for two years that as soon as my husband goes back to school, we are leaving our state. 

My D(ear)H and I do not particularly fit in where we currently live as it is a very outdoorsy area with a lot of farmers (yay Midwest USA haha) but we are looking for more of a big city lifestyle that absolutely is not available in our current location. We have explained this several times and have decided that it won't be explained again and will be met with ""because we want to.""

 DH will be going back to school for a higher nursing degree than his current one in a little over a year (fingers crossed on that part!) and we have carefully looked over the schools available for this specialization, considering outside factors like cost of living and everything. We've narrowed it down to a school and a back up (there are only like 30 ish schools that offer the spec,) both out of state but one considerably further than the other.  There is one school for this spec in our state that MIL went to about 40 years ago for a basic nursing degree that she pushes every chance she can get, even when we aren't discussing school or the move. 

Normally, she is met with our hemming and hawing about ""well we'll consider it"" and that's it. Unfortunately, my temper flared and I told her that the in state college wasn't under consideration because it isn't as good as the other colleges which is mostly true. It's a very religious school in a place we want to escape, but it also doesn't have the prestige of the other schools we're looking at. This has now started a whole new round of ""but what about [in state college]? It is such a good college, that's where I went and xyz person went and we both worked as nurses and we did fine!"" Which is, rightfully, driving DH and I absolutely batty. 

DH is now (rightfully) frustrated with me because I really brought this down upon him as he's the one required to talk to her weekly because of loaned money. Ugh. Hopefully she gets the memo sometime before we move."
278,"My LO's birthday just passed. I had messaged Druggie Diva a couple weeks ago telling her no gifts. My jygrandma was able to make the party last minute, but she went by Druggie Diva's place. Now she doesn't tell DD when she's visiting us, but she'll stil come by since we're so close. Well, to get under my skin, DD gave her a card, knowing she'd drop by at least at this point. Now I told DD no gifts, and I told Grandma that I said that. But technically, a card isn't a gift, and I had previously told Grandma to give me things like cards, so I can filter them. She didn't give me the card, she gave it to DH. Now that's fine, except it was busy (remember, kids party) and he didn't hear who it was from. He told LO it was from grandma, but Grandma was upset (knowing what I'd said but also not wanting to contradict DD) and DH was upset, but not at Grandma. He was upset because DD had her pedophile bf sign the card. 

Guys that was what killed me. The bf she was allowing to groom my kid had his damn name in the card. 

I'm not mad at Grandma. I just threw the card away. LO got some nice gifts from us, her friend, and grandma, she can have those things. DD did it to get under my skin, and so knowing that I'm not reacting to her. But damn that woman has balls."
279,"So, my dad called me tonight for the first time in a month. He rarely asks how I’m doing and just goes in to what’s going on with him. At the end of the call, he said something about my mother wanting to talk to me. I feel like I finally stood up for myself. I said “I really don’t want to talk to her” he said “well she’s called you” which she has. And she left me very nasty, passive aggressive messages. Which I mentioned. He told me she didn’t leave me nasty messages. I replied with “I can send them to you if you want to hear them” and he left it at that. 
I have enough of my own stuff going on to deal with her whoa is me attitude. And to top it off, I’ve had a super emotional weekend, and I need to make sure my own mental health is in check and not deal with her bs."
280,"I’m trying to sort this one out but it is beyond me. I could use your wise advice. 


My Narcissistic Mother was a raging bitch. I had pretty rose tinted glasses where she was concerned until I was 28. I met my now husband (first boyfriend, yes at 28!), and she was ok at first. At about the one year mark I think she figured out he was sticking around and went on a campaign to destroy my life. She wanted her personal chef and live-in daughter/spouse (there is no cute name like sonsband for this) back under her thumb. 

The story is long and dirty but has little bearing on my ask for help. Highlight include her sending cops to his house several times (wellness checks/seeking a peace bond/claims we were meth addicts). It was truely insane and nearly destroyed me. He saved me. Got us out of Dodge. And I went LC/NC.  My final words to her were telling her to Go Fuck Herself when she said she’d have my student loans paid off if I left him and came home. She died six months later.  (Cancer. She told me she had it on my 30th birthday. I didn’t believe her, even before I’d found these sorts of online support groups I suspected ‘Christmas cancer’). 

So life moves on. I even repair, sort of, the relationship with my grandmother when I get pregnant. Family. You know. Kiddo is now almost six. And he has figured out there is a hole in the family tree. “If bubba is dadda’s mum, but Omie is your grandma and my great grandma then where is your mother?” Seriously. I’ve never mentioned the woman. 

So yea! We have a talk about people dying. About how she died before he was born. And now, now, now he asks about her ALL the damn time. And it’s like a knife in the heart. We can be cruising along in the car singing to Raffi Radio and he asks if Her Name taught me the words to You are my Sunshine. Or I’m making a favourite dinner and he wants to know what she cooked. And I can’t bad talk her (I did tell him she wouldn’t let me have pizza because SHE didn’t like it and he was round eyed horrified:-). But I’m still so damn angry. And I fucking hate her for the stunts she pulled. And he blindsides me  out of the blue with these questions when I’m just fine and my chest clenches so hard and I want to yell at him to stop bringing her up...but that’s hardly a healthy way to teach him to treat death. 

So what the hell do I do?"
281,"So about a week after the sepsis carry on, I got a phone call about 1515. It's grantrum, screaming down the phone how she needed an ambulance because she can't move. 

After a discussion I establish that she can move, she's been up for a smoke, to let the dog out, get a coffee.... She's not in pain, she's not had a stroke. She's not acutely unwell. I tell her she doesn't need an ambulance, but phone her own GP (DR) to come out, she's saying the won't come. I tell her to phone GP and if they won't come, phone me back and I'll get something sorted. 

She calls back saying they're sending out a district nurse. Great.

District nurse arrives about 1700 hrs, determines she's got a chest infection, starts her on rescue antibiotics and steroids. Good. At this point her observations are good,  BP stable, apyrexial, O2 sats mid 90's, resp rate raised but not concerning. 

DH gets in from work after 1900, I tell him to phone his mum, he says he'll do it later. Eventually she phones us at 2300, sounding fairly normal, says she feels not too bad and is going to her bed. 

Next day at 11am we get a call from District nursing team, who going to check her over again cannot get an answer at the house, or the phone. The district nurse assistant, God love her, climbed in through an open window and found her in bed, blue, floppy and dying from respiratory failure. 

She died in hospital a few days later from respiratory failure caused by a combination on continuing to smoke with COPD and morbid obesity, because she wouldn't comply with the treatment. Even at the end she was thrawn, but we were there every day and she was comfortable.

My husband is still struggling with how he feels about it all, I'm angry at her because it was fixable and she made it so hard on herself. 

She could have had a great relationship with me. She could have had a great life with her grandkids. She was only 68. I'd talked to DH about converting a room for her if she got out, because I didn't like her but I would have done it for him. 

Even at the end, when she knew she was dying she wouldn't let 'her boy' see her struggling, I'd have to send him to 'the café down the bottom floor for tea' so that I could feed her, clean her and tidy her up for him coming back. All she asked every day was if he was okay? Is he eating alright? Will I look after him? 

It's heartbreaking because she did all this on her own/ to herself and it could have been so much better if she'd only bent a little."
282,"See the bot for past posts.

I will continue to maintain NC with my mom. Grandma passed away today in the hospital. I don't want to talk about it but did want to update people who cared. 

Thank you for all of the support I got through all of this."
283,"First, thank you to this amazing community. I’ve been watching from the shadows for awhile, commiserating with the headaches that are JNMILs. While mine may mainly just be BEC moments, it’s nice to have somewhere to vent with like minded people.

Now my previous post wasn’t meant to turn into a debate on vaccinations. I have my opinions based on science and experience in the healthcare field. Others are entitled to different opinions, but those people also have to understand there are consequences for their decisions.

The unfortunate situation I’ve come into is that my daughter is the 7th grandchild and no one before me has ever addressed the flu shot issue (as previously mentioned, JYSIL did make them get the Tdap before the oldest grandchild was born and that was about 5 years ago). DH’s opinion on the entire situation is that medicine isn’t his area of expertise, so he defers to me for those situations. So whatever I say, goes.

Now onto today. I was having a conversation with a friend that is due with her first in December about the whole adults and vaccinations issue. She felt like she was going crazy trying to think of everyone who may want to see her little one after birth. Having just recently gone through that myself, I decided to make the following post on social media, so I don’t have to actively reach out to every single person that may have contact with my DD:

“Since that time of year is quickly approaching, this is just a friendly reminder for everyone:
Don’t take it personally if you are not allowed to hold someone’s baby because you made the choice not to get the flu shot this season.
That’s the great thing about freedom of choice, we’re all allowed to make them.
You choose not to get the flu shot and I choose not to let those people have contact with my infant daughter.
Her life is far more important to me than your opinions.

Also, just because this needs to be said as well:
Don’t kiss babies that aren’t yours.
Not their faces.
Not their heads.
Not their hands.
Not their feet.

Protect those who can’t protect themselves.”

Not even an hour later, MIL is calling DH in a tizzy because “she doesn’t do vaccinations” and “she’s never got any in her life.” DH kindly reminded her she got her Tdap before nephew was born and that’s why we didn’t even bring it up before DD was born. We’re not making them get it, but visits with DD will be extremely limited, if they happen at all. She of course had to get off the phone because she was so emotional.

Lord help me.


Edit: Forgot to add that JNSIL (DH’s younger sister) is due with her 2nd at the beginning of December and MIL is going to be way more hands on with that baby. So even if she won’t do it for my daughter, I’d hope she’d do it that little one."
284,"Hey y'all, I'm a long time lurker but this is my first time posting. I love reading all of these JNMIL stories because some of them really resonate with me and I enjoy all the advice given. Warms my heart that there is a specific reddit for topics like this. 

So my SO (significant other) has two last names. A little background about that - his father has always been in his life and in his adult years they've gotten significantly closer which I love to see. His mother raised him growing up. She's not the most stable I would say - there have been many instances that I hope I can talk about in future posts in where I believe she is diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder. I do have a pretty positive relationship with her and usually it's pretty good. But during her episodes, breakdowns and meltdowns this is when I dislike her the most. Mostly because she treats my SO like shit. There have been many things that have happened within the past two years in their family and it definitely has taken a toll on both of them. I used to come around a lot to family parties and gatherings and visiting JNMIL's home. Since everything has happened, I have distanced myself more and more because I'm tired of the constant arguing and yelling over the pettiest, littlest things. Now, I just resort to seeing JNMIL once to three times a month. 

The last time we visited, we were talking about marriage and weddings because we went to a wedding the weekend before seeing her. The topic of taking last names came up. I've always wanted to keep my last name but was always open to hyphenating it. The problem is my SO has two last names, and he wants to keep his father's last name. His reason for this is because he will be the last one to carry that last name. She paused and started to yell at him saying ""wow this is a slap in my face"" and ""I **RAISED YOU, NOT HIM**"" blahblahblah. Pity party. My SO has always had a closer relationship with his father because in his words ""he is the most normal"" and they connect way better as they share the same interests. She says the *only* reason *she* added his father's last name is *out of respect*. My SO understands that, but it has caused a lot of issues growing up such has having to get both parents to sign forms, both parents to sign permission trip forms, etcetc. Anyways, the only reason I'm talking about this is because I don't want any issues about us getting married. (Honestly, I would've taken his father's name anyways just because it's shorter and my last name is already long). She raised hell when SO's older brother was planning his wedding with JYSIL. That's a different story. 

I guess the point of this is to ask: what would anyone else do in this position? Am I just overreacting and thinking this whole thing? I just want to say to her that it's SO's decision and she's just putting pressure on him and manipulating him in doing what she wants and it has to stop - but she's yelled at me before for standing up for SO. He's an adult and can make his own decisions but sometimes she's too much to handle. WWYD?"
285,"Grinch reference above because this is all about a MIL who goes all out for Xmas and practically thinks she’s Mrs Claus herself. Funds are low this year, DH and myself are trying to keep things relatively simple for gifts this year because A.)LO has tons and tons of toys, many of which are supplied by MIL anytime she visits, it’s getting out of hand.  And B. )Toys really are a temporary happiness that fades quickly with young ones. This year DH had a great idea to do season passes to children’s museum/aquarium. Something that would provide learning, good bonding time for everyone involved, as well as creating fun/memorable experiences instead of just toys that hardly get played with.  Tried to casually bring this up to MIL (generally we get along well) and I could sense immediately that she was offended by the idea of us not wanting her to supply *a lot* of toys for Christmas, things got awkward immediately when I offered that they could go in on a season pass with us..no response from MIL and the conversation immediately ended. I’m not confrontational so didn’t want to push it.  Now reaching out for advice on a nice, yet assertive way to word all that was said above w/o offending MIL. Some of this may be petty too, being as simple as not wanting to be upstaged by MIL on Xmas.  
Other info: MIL is easily offended and plays it off by sugar coating everything but never actually gets over it.  Nothing concerning family issues ever gets talked about, just swept under the rug."
286,"TW: Mention of Suicidal Ideation

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia over 25 years ago. It was a long diagnostic process because: it's a ""disease of exclusion"" so they have to rule out anything else, anyway; it wasn't well known at the time, even in the medical community; and, back then, it was mostly thought to only occur in post-menopausal women, but I was in my early teens. So, it was a pretty harrowing ordeal, capped off by being told, at such a young age, that I would suffer for the rest of my life, likely only getting worse with time, and there was nothing they could do. Oh, can I come back from time to time for brain scans to track the potential degenerative affect of chronic nerve pain on my brain? And, by the way, to ""prolong the efficacy of pain regimens"" no physician was likely to prescribe me pain killers until I was 35. I asked, what should I do until then? Take ibuprofen, I was told after a pause.

During this time, my mother complained about medical bills, enabled my burgeoning emotional over-eating, and fixated on her alcoholic abuser who would ""accidentally"" try to crawl naked into my bed at night. (Now it's thought there's a strong correlation between trauma and FMS.)

A few years ago, I connected with a second cousin on Facebook. I posted something about Fibromyalgia and she commented, ""Oh, you have that too! Just like your mother!""

Come to find out, the year I was diagnosed, when my mother dragged me to a family reunion and I sat at a table miserable and in pain, she flitted about the room and told relatives that SHE had just been diagnosed with FMS. Why? Probably because it was unknown and seemed unusual and she could make of it whatever she wanted. I guess it was more ""exotic"" at the time than her actual illnesses (RA and a secret narcotic opiate addiction).

I was so young and I was staring down fifty, sixty, seventy years of suffering. I was contemplating suicide rather than do it. And my mother wore my pain like a costume for attention.

That bitch."
287,"Y’all, we missed BINGO (or in this case GOBS!) by the thing that was such a guarantee I made it the Free Space. This is something so awful it’s the primary reason we refuse to go out to dinner with her anymore, so on-going she did it at our wedding twenty-four years ago, and so pervasive she’s done it every time I can remember being in her presence ever. 

What was the Free Space, you ask? Foodgasm. 

Imagine if you will your average seventy-two year old JNMIL tucked in to the dinner table (or breakfast, or lunch, or random snack food encounter). She’s really enjoying the experience. Like, a whole, WHOLE lot. Her eyelids flutter. Her eyes roll back in her head. Then the *sounds* begin...

Now think about the noises y’all hear from your average pornographic film. Skin slapping? Check! (Cuz her lips are a flapping and a smacking.) Moans, groans, and ecstatic cries of delight? Check! (Puts *When Harry Met Sally* to shame, because Gobsmacker is in earnest.) Moist sounds that should only be between the participants of an act of love? Check! (It’s truly atrocious.) 

Everyone else is left feeling acutely uncomfortable as they’re made to bear witness to Gobsmacker’s intimacy with her food (except perhaps for FIL, who I assume is quite talented at tuning her out after half a century-ish of marriage). Having a meal with my MIL leaves people feeling *dirty*, y’all, like they’ve witnessed something they weren’t supposed to be privy to. 

We’ve tried mirroring her, we’ve tried leading by example, we’ve tried railing and raving and shaking our fists. Nothing has worked. Until I made Bingo cards and put the inevitable Foodgasm at the center. Who knew.

Other highlights to the birthday dinner/unloading of Overseas Sweets:
- “I’ve missed my babies” comment within the first three minutes. I expected it to be made about SIL’s kids but it was about ours. DH has since pointed out that SIL’s kids are “my precious babies”, and ours are just “my babies”. I hadn’t necessarily noticed that distinction but it definitely tracks.

- That feeling of dread I was having? It was a predromal thing that happens before seizures sometimes. My neurological disorders decided to kick off and I was laying down resting before they arrived. It was bad enough that I was on the walker. Gobsmacker came over to greet me (read: stand directly in my way and keep me on my feet wayyy longer than necessary) and bemoan how she never sees/talks to me anymore. I was just not feeling her martyrdom, so I helpfully pointed out that I rarely leave the house without prior notice (getting ready/going out takes a lot of energy for me, noise and visual stimulation can set off my seizures, and aside from appointments and special occasions I wanna be able to budget my energy usage - yes, this is all very inconvenient and I hate it, but I’m used to it and it is what it is) so I’m easy to find if she wants me. She got a little blinky but recovered quickly and said “Haha, I guess that’s true. I just don’t know what a good time to call would be because I never know when you might be resting.” Okay, I’ll give her that early on we had to seriously smack her with some boundaries about just showing up and ringing the doorbell, because it would rile up the dogs (noise, seizures, yeah) and I was resting a lot in those days after multiple brain surgeries. I haven’t had a surgery in years now. So I established eye contact, smiled real big, pulled my cell phone out of the pouch DH made for my walker, and said “I always keep this nearby. Trust me, I’m not shy about letting people know when it’s not a good time to talk and I need to call them back.” She looked a little chagrined, but also wanted to Look Nice While Being The Martyr. “Well, I would just really hate to wake you up if you’re sleeping because I know that’s important for you.” I don’t know why I didn’t want to leave well enough alone but I wasn’t playing her game. *She* put *me* in the Naughty Corner in January, not the other way around; she doesn’t now get to claim she’s just looking out for my well-being! I put the ball squarely in her court: “That’s nice, Gobs, but if I’m sleeping I’m gonna ignore the phone. If you want to see or talk to me then you can call me or text me or facespace message me anytime. I’ll get back to you when it’s convenient if I can’t talk right then. I’m coming for my chair, FIL, look out.” Then I started rolling, Gobsmacker opted to get out of my way before I ran into her, and FIL got out of the only recliner I can adjust manually with some good-natured snark about being displaced. (Yeah, sorry, the angry brain is particular about angles and pressure and the other chairs just won’t do on a bad day. I don’t feel guilt.) 

- Talked about how “tall and handsome” and “precious” SIL’s kids are, how much we wouldn’t believe it, how much she looooves them, and passed around pictures for our admiration, at length. The niblings are great, I admit wholeheartedly, and I enjoyed seeing pics. But each one is a production, to be paraded around from person to person by Gobsmacker, the story of its subjects and setting told each time, and everyone must have a comment before she’ll move on. This interferes with the experience of interacting with the kids/grandkids at hand. In this case, she pulled out her phone while DD2 was opening gifts. (DD2 retaliated by pulling out pictures of her “fur baby”, a gorgeous tarantula, and telling proud parent stories. I love my family, y’all!) 

- “My boy is an awesome cook!” The comment was, of course, accompanied by touching and feeling by Gobsmacker, and ducking and weaving by DH. 

Today we’re going to birthday dinner with Shame Nun, so more fun times are in my future. Send happy thoughts, and chocolate. So much chocolate!"
288,"Hello everyone! English is not my first language and I'm on mobile. Sorry for any mistakes, grammar etc. This is about my cuz but my exmil is pure concentrated madness I will share stories about her. We have a some court issues with her and she is bringing up all sorts of nasty. 

My (32M) cousin (31F) is having twins (awesome!) and her DF (31) is an amazing bloke and together they make a great team/couple. My husband (33) and I together with her sisters, brother and cousins arranged a baby shower for her, it was fun planning it (last four years they all had babies so it was easy to arrange) but the DF kept telling us his mom is kinda loca, we all thought we all hispanic/latino we know we all can be dramatic or emotional, temperamental etc. But no, he is lc with his mom, his dad is not in the picture and his sisters moved to the other side of the country for work, but he said they moved as fast and far as they could. We made lots of food, party favours, photos of the twins in the womb, photos of the darling couple, of their dog and cat, lots of photos to celebrate their little family.

Well.. His mother arrived 45 min late, well her son did say she would be ""fashionably late"" to make her entrance. But.. We shot her down called her desgraciada and she was shooketh, her bf was silent. All went well till she tried to make it about her but none of us were having it. We're protective of each other and we don't let the mil from hell even try anything. Then she said the food was bad, her son said not to eat the food. Then she drank sangria like it was water.

Then she tried to insult people and cultures which is stupid, we all married into different races and ethnicities (which is great for potluck) and she was shut down. Then she tried to bump and grind with her son? Like.. Wtf is it with these women and wanting to bone their sons? Then she said his seed was powerful and gave our cuz twins? Not how it works and ew david. THEN she tried to keep touching my cousins belly when she was told not to, my cousin has put down her boundaries and doesn't want to be touched without permission. Her body her choice + why would you want to keep touching someone who said no? Seriously my ancestors will smite us with chanclas if we behaved like her mil...

During all this she insulted some of our cousins, myself included, why our mother's weren't there to support their family and cook. We told her they're dead but we could try ouija or summat and she was not pleased with that. She also did not like that the gays and lesbians in our family were so open about it and God would punish us. So she was racist, xenophobic, rude, lannister style and overly religious, happy she's not my mil or mum.

Best part came when she tried to grab the balls of her son, he pushed her down on a chair and walked away.. We were all a bit shocked tbh..then couple minutes later she tried to hug and rub my cousins belly from behind... And my cousin turned around and slapped the shit out her. We were all a bit surprised but we know her so.. Expected. She pushed her boundaries and got slapped so hard she dramatically fell to the floor and began to scream and cry for her son, saying she was assaulted, attempted murder and what not. Telenovela style ofc. Her son told her she was warned and that she wasn't welcome anymore and that he wanted distance and time to think. She crawled towards him and he walked away with my cousin. Her bf picked her up and we walked her towards her car so we knew she would be gone.
The party was fun after and we laughed. But damn, she's marrying into that family and I feel for them but we have a bet going on when nc is going to be implemented.

Thanks for reading! Had to share with people who go through the same thing with their mil or jnfam. Do you guys have any tips for the lovely couple?"
289,"
Hey all, first post, on mobile, standard disclaimer. 

This is more funny than anything else, we’ve had worse issues in the past, but I can’t make this shit up.

Context: FDH is an only child of a divorced mother. FFIL is in the picture and great at receiving boundaries. 

Every year on my FDH’s birthday, my FMIL tells the story of his birth. Not in a cute way, in a way that makes his birthday all about her and what she was going through on the day however many years ago.

Last month, before his birthday, we reached out via group text to talk about something trivial and unrelated. The text went something like this:

FDH: hi mom

FMIL: who’s this? 

FDH: your son

FMIL: Oh, I forgot I had a son! (Because we hadn’t spoken with her in 2 weeks due to being outrageously swamped with our own lives)

Me (having zero time for her passive aggressive BS): No you didn’t, you tell his birth story all the time.

FMIL: Thanks for the call out, OP

I thought it was over with and we had moved on. Wrong.

This week was FDH actual birthday. His mom made it very clear she HAD to have dinner with him on the day of his birthday because ‘as a mother, it’s so important to her to get the ACTUAL day’. Ok. Whatever.  Even though she has gone on vacation on his actual birthday a couple years ago but WHATEVER. FDH and I did our own celebration the day before.

We get to the restaurant to meet his mom and his grandma and everything seems great. She’s pleasant, no passive aggressive comments yet. We order drinks and appetizers. After the waiter leaves to put our appetizer order in, FMIL suggests we do cards. She had already shipped him all of his gifts so we didn’t have to carry them home.

Side note: FDH is infamously hard to shop for so every year he makes a list for his birthday/ Christmas to make it easier for everyone. She got him his entire list this year and had all items delivered to our house the day before. It was a little outrageous and by no means does he expect this. 

He opens his grandma’s card and it’s a cute little note with a gift card to a mega coffee shop chain. Then he gets to FMIL card.

She says “open it, read it out loud.” 

You. Guys. She had typed out his birth story, in detail, down to who was playing the World Series that year, how large his head is, and how long she labored for. 

FDH starts reading it (facepalm moment) and I am sucking down my overpriced Old Fashioned hoping that the alcohol will help me not to burst out laughing and that the circus music in my head will drown out the uncomfortable fucking details about how my FDH came into this world.

It ended with something along the lines of “I always knew you were a kind, loving soul, with a great sense of humor, even before you were born.” Apparently FDH was a hilarious fetus.

The rest of dinner went as expected. A few quips, here and there, a lot of self- esteem boosting comments and stories, a few uncomfortable silences. Mostly pleasant dinner talk.

After, I asked FDH why he read it out loud and he goes “Dude, I don’t know. I’m used to the weirdness I guess.” But he realized how bizarre the ritual is and how much the tradition makes his birthday about her.

Overall, not the worst that’s ever happened, but we definitely talked to our therapist about it the next day."
290,"I had my daughter this past Monday. I went into labor early Sunday morning and didn’t have her until 5pm Monday via c section. My MIL came to visit while I was in labor waiting to dilate some more. I was against it at first, but after the pain meds kicked in I didn’t care anymore. She ended up leaving because it was late and she can’t drive in the dark. She was super bummed and didn’t want to miss the birth. I didn’t want her to be there in the first place. She kissed me goodbye and left. Monday she did the same, visited and tried waiting out to stay for the c section, but it got too late and she had to leave. Another kiss was planted. When I got into recovery I noticed my face was super itchy. I scratched it pretty badly around my chin lips and under my nose during the few times I got sleep. It had scabbed up pretty bad. So the itchiness was written off as coming off of anesthesia and totally normal. I’ve been kissing me newborn and loving on her this whole time. I got home Wednesday evening and ended up washing my face to help with the itching and rubbed my face and lips raw with a towel in desperation. I put aquaphor over everything to help it heal. Thursday rolls around and I notice scabs on my lip. I apply more aquaphor hoping it would heal. Today they turned into blisters and MIL came to visit. DH noticed the blisters and mentioned cold sores. I told him it was from me scratching and applying aquaphor over it. Him and MIL comment on how they looked like cold sores. He finally checks them out and says nvm. Meanwhile MIL is sporting a scabbed over cold sore. We had already told her no kissing baby with cold sore. She decided to press her cheek against her face as she says bye and kisses mine and DH on the cheek. We were too shocked to say anything. When she was gone we both had a WTF realization and decided to tell her tomorrow when she comes back no touching without hand sanitizer and no getting close to her face period. Well I noticed a few more smaller blisters pop up tonight. DH confirmed and my heart sank. I mentioned her kissing me at the hospital several times. He’s not happy and now need to keep a close eye on DD because I had been kissing her forehead since she was born. No mouth or nose, just forehead. I’m so devastated and my husband thinks I’m over reacting because cold sores are common. He has them too. MIL gave them to him."
291,"On a throwaway account, since DH knows my main and that I surf here regularly. TRIGGER WARNING: PREGNANCY LOSS.

My MIL is not JN I think, I'll let you guys be the judge here on that, but she IS a big ass question mark regarding the future and especially regarding my son. This will be super long, and on mobile 

When D(Dear)H (29M) and I (27F) started being serious, she was ultra friendly and honestly still is to my face. She puts in all the right noises and ""awww's"" and ""that's so sweet!"" and polite laughter but makes 0% effort at a relationship when you're not in her immediate presence. She calls her son maybe once every 2-3 months. 

In the early days, I got along with her husband (JN himself for other reasons) far better than her because he's loud and outgoing. For simplicity we will call him S(tep)FIL but I was dating my husband when they got married, she got divorced from FIL in like 2012 while DH was in college. I had 2 minor headbutts  with SFIL that affected MIL: A) SFIL told me something about his job before MIL and she got pissed/jealous big time... and later after we moved away, B) I made a review on SFIL's previous employer's FB page regarding their treatment of him and expressed that it was their loss and clearly the quality of service they provided has gone down hill and they freaked the fuck out. I took it down and SFIL started an argument with me at 4AM expecting an apology about it and I refused because I wasn't wrong, they fully agreed, and I took it down when they asked - Not a big deal but starting shit at 4AM when I first get up got me pissed and they hit my stubborn streak. By this time, I've been with DH two years at this point and started doing some growing up and realizing faaaaamily doesn't mean I have to ""love"" them the same way I love my JYParents. Outside from MIL commenting on my book of faces statuses, she'd be 100% NC of her own volition. 

Right around event B, we had just gotten married and moved to another state, 2hrs from MIL. They're literally the closest to us geographically. After this event, and within the first year of marriage I start having some very weird painful nerve pain around my chest that we could NOT figure out. I ended up having a pain mgmt procedure done that I reacted HORRIBLY to and made my condition far worse. Very JNFIL fled the country and died within a week of his ""move"" (he was a very weird man, and we think got into drugs, and other things since his divorce) and somehow I was saddled with all of his affairs. It was a nightmare, you guys. Between my pain and the stress of managing the affairs of a deceased family member in another state, and since my husband had a great job and was supporting us well, I quit work to manage all the crazy and try to pick up a small side business. It took almost 4 months to get JNFIL's affairs in order with little help from DH's side because no one knew what he was into... and tbh I wanted to shield them a little from how... JN he really had become. DH did help and as the heir to all the madness definitely had a part to play, but I managed the whole thing. Please don't attack him thinking I was completely alone, but this was 1000% hard on DH losing his dad suddenly, on bad terms, and when we were hoping to reconcile. 

Now, this is JNMIL, right? This woman actually calls me regularly during those 4 months to see what dirt I had turned up. She was legally removed from the whole thing after the divorce so it was all for her morbid curiosity and I seriously needed to vent about what a POS FIL was and what damage he left in his wake (including a drunk driving incident where he hit a family of 5 less than a month before he fled the country - everyone was OK!). Within 3 weeks of this finally coming to a close I got incredibly ill. Lots of pain, vaginal bleeding... for almost 3 weeks. 

Turns out.. I was pregnant! That's all we knew for 3 days, until the tests came back as an unhealthy pregnancy. It was ectopic and something was very wrong. My mom stayed for a week and a half so my husband could work because I could barely walk. I had quite a bit of internal bleeding and if we had waited any longer for surgery i would have not be here now. By some miracle, I got to keep my baby making parts. I get one text from MIL and tbh it really... hurt. She at least made an effort, I guess? 

The next year, MIL falls and has to have surgery on her arm... and idk why but I was working remote and offered to come stay to help her out. She declined, thank god. 

DH looks at getting his tonsils out. MIL wants to come stay take care of her baaaaaby after surgery. Thankfully he didnt end up getting it. You get the picture, though. 

Weve lived out of state 3 years now and they've visited twice. Once for Xmas because I started putting my foot down on travelling to EVERYONE during the holidays, and once recently because I am successfully pregnant with our son, 23wks in. Yall, she was late to the gender ultrasound.... she literally almost missed it and brought SFIL without asking. I was irked, but let it go because I'm trying to leave enough rope for her to hang herself when her and DH realize that I've been giving her every opportunity to step up and have a relationship with me and she is blatantly ignoring it. 

She has not called or texted me once about the pregnancy. We invited her to the event center where we are throwing the baby shower (mostly me throwing my own because I'm doing a very non-traditional party since we only had a courthouse wedding and my mom is quite lost with what I want). Shes not contacted me until i made a FB post asking about photographers. That's the 3rd time shes talked to me directly since I became pregnant. Also, she recommended a sketchy friend who did boudoir photo shoots and tbh the quality was... not great. 

Baby shower is next week. DH and I were talking and I asked him if he had talked to his mom about baby stuff. Practically zero. No idea what she was planning to do when labor hits or visiting after. Our current labor game plan is me (duh), DH, my JYMom, and the doula in the room, JYDad outside but in the hospital. MIL and SFIL are welcome at the hospital but again they havent talked about this at ALL. And MIL and SFIL got their vaccines at my request, which brought all this up. 

DH knows that we dont have a relationship and he has similar concerns that MIL is going to push me and my boundaries with my son because shes not tried to get to know me at all. She seems to need someone depending on her to function and she was a STAHM most of DH's life. I'm 100% afraid she is going to want to move up here and be a stay at home grandma even though shes never said anything about it... it's just my underlying fear becsuse she has no ambition and has had the same job at a hardware chain for years - no retirement, no plan and my husband is already preparing himself for us to support her in her old age... and I dont agree with how she made certain decisions with raising DH, she has 5 loud yappy dogs, and I have planned everything out how I want it because I am a little bit of a control freak when it comes to my ""space.""  I'm working from home for the first 6mo of baby's life too. 

Essentially what I hope is that she continues her current path and doesn't got MIL crazy when my son is born because it's an opportunity for a do-over baby. I know she will be a FB Grandma like shes the most involved person ever, but at the moment, we dont plan on baby ever staying the night with the IL's until he's old enough to communicate with us, and we know she will get jealous of my parents' relationship (she already is) with us/LO because they... idk, put in the effort to come see us and invite us to their house regularly (2.5-3hrs away). We see them about once a month. We see MIL on major holidays only.

So all this rambling history comes down to - DH asked me to reach out and call her to try and initiate a relationship. I agreed, but said ""I will call her once and once I make that contact, and she doesn't call me afterwards or ever again - I dont want you to ask me to try again. It's a two way street and I'm not going to force it."" Tbh, I dont mind how little contact things are now, but she better not expect me to bend over backwards when she hits grandma status. Am I overreacting? Do I have a JN or am I putting too much into this? 

Thank you so much for reading through all this!

ETA some words and be more clear. Words are hard.

Update 1: After asking some questions and trying to see where he is going with this request he did back off and say I didnt have to do this, but it would make him feel better. I pointed out the big doors I've left open for MIL and how she has behaved towards me in the past and he definitely sees where I'm coming from, but I still agreed to open the door this way, one more time. He said he won't prod me to do this again because that is unfair. He's just frustrated because he and I both feel this is going to blow up someday - he's conflict adverse and I am definitely conflict friendly (I believe conflict is not inherently bad and provides a good opportunity to communicate as long as everyone can remain calm and level-headed). I will make the call in the next 8hrs somewhere and I asked that he is there. It's super awkward and stressful for me. I plan to have it on speakerphone.

Update 2: The call happened and I cut it off at 30 min. We mostly talked about her work and then the baby shower. She offered to help and such, but she has made such noises in the past and didnt follow thru. Like I said, she says all the right things when you're on the spot with her. DH said we will see if she follows up with anything she said she would do. But, it's done."
292,"This is pretty tame compared to other stories I’ve come across but it annoyed me enough to want to put it out into the internet void.

In general, I get along with my MIL very well. I’ve been with my SO (not yet engaged or married but working towards it) since high school, about 9.5 years. It’s not super relevant to the story but for some background, there were some significant bumps at the very beginning (first few months) of our relationship with MIL. Seemed she had difficulty letting go of her “baby” for the first time. It was challenging but things got much better after the first year. For the most part she minds her business, is very loving, and stays in her lane.

But sometimes. She drives me up the wall.

My SO got the job offer of his life this week. It’s something he’s been working very hard to accomplish, we moved halfway across the country for this and it’s amazing to see his hard work pay off. He of course called his family, told me, I told my family - it’s an exciting time! 

I was texting MIL today about something unrelated (honestly I was sending photos of my dog in her new winter coat because reasons) and during the conversation I said “did you hear the good news?!” And she responds with “I did!!!!!! That is exciting. But it mean’s long hours. So not much time to see you.”

Now, I could be overreacting but hear me out. The job he got is no doubt going to be extremely demanding; it’s a harsh industry though, luckily, extremely high paying. And also, we moved here to support this and it’s been an awesome adventure. This is his dream and I know he’d support me in mine no matter what, he has shown me so a thousandfold. 

This is a happy moment, why are you dragging it down by pointing out a negative ?? That’s like telling someone your favorite movie and being met with “oh I didn’t like that movie at all, it suuuucked.” I’m sorry ??? I’m not an idiot. I know what I got myself into. My SO and I talk about our expectations and our future plans at length. We compromise, we have worked really hard to grow into having positive and productive communication skills. I don’t know how else to say that I literally don’t need her fucking input. Especially when it’s just so idiotic and a waste of words. Your son just accomplished something wonderful!! This is so uncalled for ?? Especially considering I hadn’t at all thought about in a negative way. And now the thought is in my head when this should be a happy time for all of us.

I responded with a “well that’s a downer!” And she sent a quick “sorry” and I reminded her how hard he worked to get here and changed the subject. 

I get that she might have had other intentions, etc. but frankly I think this was inappropriate. She has these moments of being completely out of line and somehow not reading the room or social cues. It’s usually with a sex or fart joke which is fine ??

Anyway. It just pissed me off. I told my SO and he had the same reaction as I did but not as annoyed, more of a “Jesus Christ why”.

Again, I know it’s not as crazy and part of me might be overreacting but when the anger subsides I know I’ll still be very annoyed by it."
293,"Apologies in advance I suck at writing, there is no excuse. 

So things were nice and quiet for awhile. In the past year I have been doing some counselling and was recommended to not let my In Laws have power over me. Make things they do and say roll off my back like water off a duck. DH has taken over communication and setting boundaries with his side of the family. Things were getting better.

Was it possible that my JNMIL, was becoming more like a just-*maybe*-mother-in-law?

Heck, she even believed me when I told her that her Golden Child BIL was acting like a slob. (Seriously though we moved empty boxes out of his room and cleaned over an inch of dust from his floor. The guy is 27 and can't take care of himself. He was losing weight from poor eating habits and at 6'1 weighs 130lbs.) This was also when I found out I am very allergic to dust mites... Needless to say he has stepped up and is making slow improvement because both his parents, DH, and I got on his case.

I disagreed with her style of helping/harrassment, but BIL was solidly not listening and I am not wanting to look after a 27 year old man... Enough about BIL, this is about The Accountant.

So with things going well enough we invited my parents and his parents to come with us for our first house viewing. A cute place out of town cause housing in Canada is going nuts at the moment. The house had some charm and had a nice country feel that reminded me of where I grew up. Or at least that is what it showed online. DH and I wanted to check it out and use it as a first experience.

My InLaws think it's nuts to look at houses now even though nothing is getting cheaper for a long long time.  My parents got that, they were happy to just be brought along. MIL thought we were uber serious about thinking of buying this house. 

So we saw the house. It was a ""pig with lipstick"" scenario and the amount of renovations to make the house livable, when neither DH or I are particularly handy, would bring us over budget. The current owners only addressed surface level stuff. So it was a no from us.

So MIL in her infinite wisdom took it upon her self to educate DH and I through email. Starting to recommend town homes in the city, telling us moving further out was a mistake based on her experience, and doing up a budget for house hunting for us based on DH's investment statements (he didn't realize he wasn't getting them in the mail and had been checking them online). 

She decided DH didn't know what his take home pay was after taxes, that he couldn't see his portfolio online, that we were ready to sink all of our time and money into a place, that we intend to move while I am in school, etc... So she was going to help us and make as many recommendations as possible. She started to open his investment statements she had been detaining. 

Two days ago, all was revealed. During a call with DH about a house she found, she said she was making a budget based on DH's savings. DH was confused and she enlightened him that it was funny that we kept telling BIL to move his mail/update his address when DH hadn't gotten everything changed either for DH's investments. Then kept is as an inside joke between her and FIL, possibly others as well for TWO YEARS.

Two bloody years! Gah! WTF?! Why not tell DH sooner and then do some good familial ribbing about it? Nope, she went the route of federal crimes.

Yesterday BIL is trying to tell MIL no he doesn't need her to overlook his designs for the house he is getting built, to step back a bit, and that it isn't great that she is micromanaging him or DH and I. Her response to that email boils down to everything is done out of love and affection. Since she actually has accounting experience and has owned a home and that we know nothing. The nerve of that email to belittling all of us just because we are under 30. Like fine, when do we become adults then, eh? BIL is 27, DH and I are 25. Do we need to earn the ***""I can adult badge!""*** To finally get her to back off?

So I wrote her an email not only telling her no more ""advice"" and stop opening mail that isn't hers or her husband's. We put her in time out. No more contact. Here is what I sent.

*Dear MIL,

I am very disappointed with what I have heard from DH.

It is illegal to open other's mail, to obstruct it from them, or to keep it a secret. This matter is very serious to DH and I. I am saddened to hear that it was taken lightly and seen as a joke. We are not laughing and there will be consequences for this decision.

Two years' worth is absolutely past the point of toeing the line and goes straight into overstepping boundaries.

DH and I are very disappointed and feel a loss of trust. We feel let down and saddened by your and FIL's decision to not tell us about this. It is almost as bad as when you said our marriage will fail because we didn't send out thank you notes immediately or within your ideal timeline. It honestly does not improve my relationship with you or DH's relationship with you if you see us as incompetent and unwilling to treat us as adults. 

It is unacceptable that our lives are constantly critiqued and we are talked about behind our backs. Just allow us to make our own decisions and mistakes. I know that you are trying to help, but the amount of advice is overwhelming and unwanted. 

We feel that we aren't listened to and that there are assumptions and perceptions being made that are incorrect and detrimental to our relationship with you and FIL. DH and I know to ask for help on subjects we don't fully understand; our mothers did not raise fools. Many of the things you are critiquing us on are actually in line with our thoughts. If this was not communicated at Tim's that we did not want that house, it is unfortunate.

Additionally, your email to DH and BIL needs to be addressed. How the email was worded is inflammatory, quite belittling, and insulting to all of us. DH and I have a balanced relationship and we feel hurt by the fact it is perceived as otherwise. DH and I have talked about this last night and today and have come to a decision.

We will need some space after this. This is not open for discussion.

Commisural_Tracts and DH*

And her response. In square brackets is where I will add some notes in for additional context. 

*Hi DH,

I copied C_T on this e-mail so there is no miscommunication.

First of all, I never said your marriage would fail if you didn’t send out thank you notes immediately or within my ideal timeline.  I will swear to on a stack of bibles and my grandparent’s graves that I didn’t say anything about your marriage failing.  I will guarantee you that.* 
[You can see in my post history that I over heard her while she was **yelling** at DH over the phone]

*Secondly, we apologize for not giving you the investment statements.  We should have but you kept going on and on about BIL and how he should redirect his mail and you apparently didn’t do it yourself.  I bank with TD Canada Trust and you cannot see the statement on-line if you have chosen to have the statements sent in the mail.  I know that you can see the balance of your investment on Easyweb but not the actual statement if you are getting the statements mailed.* [This is categorically untrue. Hubs can and has been checking online.]

 *We were waiting for you to actually care enough to want to see the full statement.  It is very important to keep a close eye on your investments.  Your father never looks at the statements.  As you know, I am a bean counter.  I need to know where we are financially.  I think everybody would be further ahead if they paid attention to where their money is going.*

*Thirdly, I do understand the loss of trust.  I understand it will take you guys time to trust us again.  We are sorry.  I didn’t really start looking at the statements until recently because I wanted to know how much of a down payment you might have to buy a house.  As for my advice on buying a house, I know it wasn’t appreciated but I just couldn’t stand by and not say something.*
[She wants us to get a frigging town house in the south part of the city. Not that town houses are bad, I just don't want one. She thinks living within the sprawling city will have short commute times. It does not.]

 *Also, we did realize at Tim Hortons on Sunday that you guys weren’t interested in the house(see C_T's email).  Honestly, since you guys have been married(with the exception of the last few days) we have tried not to interfere but apparently we are failing.  We will try to not give you advice unless you ask for it.  It will be hard so no promises.  We will try our best. Also, we do not constantly critique your lives and talk behind your backs.  I’m not sure where that is coming from.*
[She talks to other ""mature adults"" or his grandparents and tries to use that to add weight to her arguments.]

*Let us know when you want to talk again.


Love, Mom*



Honestly I can't get past her try to both apologize and justify her actions. It is a very ""I am sorry, but..."" type of email. Go suck an egg through a hose MIL."
294,"SIL is pregnant with her first and MIL decided to throw her a baby shower. Okay no problem except that she told me about it the day before the shower! Even worse, she put together a basket on my behalf of things I left at her house in case my baby needs something while we are visiting. She did this in her words because she knew she was informing me last minute and didn’t want me to show up empty handed. I’m annoyed. That was MY stuff that she just gave away. Albeit, not great stuff but what is my baby to do when we go over there and I forgot wipes or whatever? Also, she put together a basket of throwaway stuff so it makes me look bad. Whatever. I still got SIL a gift. Her gift to her golden children was a mountain of homemade blankets and burp cloths and such. Definitely did not get anything that thoughtful from her for our son. Thanks for listening."
295,"Let's start with the wedding....
MIL wore a short white dress to my wedding. In her toast, she called me the wrong name and laughed about it but didn't correct herself and just ended it there. When doing table visits, she hugged me and told me she was going to learn to love me. After the wedding, she asked the photographer to do a photoshoot with her and her daughter. I didn't know about this until I got my photos two weeks later and at the end is just a bunch of pics of her and daughter. She was supposed to help with clean up, but just left. She was almost late to the wedding because she was yarn shopping. 



Skip forward to Sept. DH and I live in a touristy area. She and boyfriend (who she calls husband) decided to come for a long 4 day weekend. We tell her ok, but we have plans and I tell her I can do dinner one night and we would go on a hike with them. Weekend rolls around and we call to ask how its going. She says she isn't coming anymore bc bf got into a fight. 



The next week she calls DH to tell him that she has rebooked her trip to the ENTIRE WEEK OF THANKSGIVING. She knows I'm a teacher and have that week off and expects us to ""hang out"". DH only gets off Thursday and Friday, but expects him to take off the whole week. I got DH to call her back and let her know that he is not taking time off of work, I am not hanging out, and we are not hosting Thanksgiving. She is upset bc she spent $ on airfare and hotel. Idk if she is still coming, she is ""too upset"" to talk about it. 



Last week we called to tell her I'm 8 weeks pregnant. She was delighted. She then began asking how her son is doing and ignores me. Does he have anxiety about having a baby? Is he sleeping ok? Doesn't ask how the pregnant lady is doing. She asked if he know the gender and she was crushed when we told her no, its too early and we are waiting to find out. When she found out the due date, she was also upset because the baby will be a Taurus....



How do I establish boundaries for this pregnancy and expectations for the birth? She seems to do things out of left field that I wouldn't know to tell her not to do (private photoshot piggybacking on our wedding photos) and I'm trying to be clear about things that may be more common (planning visits)."
296,"Yesterday was JYFSIL’s 18th birthday so that means she is legally an adult in Australia and can drink (yay!)

Her JYparents planned a really nice party and OH and myself get invited so we organise for my JYMum to watch our 3yr DS and 7 week old DD.

We show up and start chatting and having a few casual drinks with YBIL and FSIL and as time goes on I asked YBIL if his parents are coming and he says yes and shows me the message from his Dad saying they are running late because Susan didn’t feel well earlier.

I told OH when he came back from getting another drink and he laughed and said “so they won’t be coming then”. 
I laugh and replied “Damn I was really looking forward to seeing how FSIL’s parents interacted with Susan and co because FSIL’s mum doesn’t like her already.

We ended up staying a little over an hour at the party because OH had to work that night and just as we left we spotted FIL and YSIL1 standing at their car getting ready to come in with no Susan Satan! She actually didn’t come! I was so relieved for FSIL so she could actually enjoy her birthday without Susan hovering putting a negative energy out and not interacting with other party guests.

On a side note at least we know she is “under the weather” so if they ask us to come visit tomorrow so they can meet finally meet DD, I can test them by asking if anyone is sick and see if they are willing to lie about being sick (again) so I can call them out and say no sorry YBIL said Susan was sick last night, too bad so sad. 😏"
297,"So I think I mentioned  in a past post that Zinnia once cheated on my father before she knew she was pregnant with me. Anyway the tl;dr is she went to a bar (with my dad's permission) got drunk went home with some rando and slept with him (got crabs and my dad had to help shave her to get rid of them)...then found out after the fact that she was pregnant with me.

So there's the important background for what I'm going to talk about next. Zinna has always been able to remember each of her children's original due dates...even my older brothers who she pretty much signed away her rights to and played the victim over. Anyway that being said I've asked her a few times what my original due date was and she always told me she couldn't remember. Now for years I've been pretty much whatever about it because she can't remember everything right? But I've been really thinking about what she said to me after my dad died (read my post history) and it finally hit me that it's not that she doesn't remember it's more of she doesn't want to admit that she fucked up and there's is a sliver of possibility that I could be another man's child. This bullshit she did also explains why my grandfather had virtually nothing to do with me. Why when he came to see my father on his deathbed why he talked to my younger brother but walked past me giving me nothing more than a dirty look.

I'm trying like hell to let this all go because I don't speak to Zinnia anymore  and the one person I really want to ask about this has been dead for almost 23 years. I just don't get what Zinnia gets out of telling me this after my father died."
298,"Me and my mother in law who will hence forth be named ""MamaBear2. 0"" or MB2. 0 for short..

Blew today.
I invited her to my sons bday on the 27th last month and she blew it off saying they couldn't get the time off to travel 4 hours.
I said OK and accepted it. Today I showed all the party bits I'm super excited as my sons now has genuine likes and dislikes.

She blew up saying it was so wrong to keep throwing a party knowing they can't come. I yet again extended an invite and offered for them to even sleep over but that wasn't OK..

I think she had a bad day but when she hung up without saying goodbye I have to admit I cried.. I've had a rough week and this just blew me over the edge.
I've texted asking if she's had a bad day but no response...

We made great progress and I won't let this little bump ruin it but it was a big shock to the system"
299,"just want to start this out by saying I have absolutely nothing against formula, I was 100% planning on it myself before randomly deciding to bf the day I gave birth. A fed baby is a happy baby.
Now, my MIL has been hounding me to get my ebf 2 month old to take a bottle. We've been trying different bottles and nipples but honestly, I'm not too concerned about it right now. I'm a SAHM and I really dont mind it. Just yesterday she said ""you're going to HAVE to give her a bottle eventually"" to which i replied ""no, i really dont."" And then she revealed the true motive ""well I'm gonna need some alone time with MY baby"" *excessively rolls eyes*
But even my usually JYM has tried to make jokes about how I'm ""keeping her to myself"" My mom isn't controlling or narcissistic and she always tries her best to have healthy boundaries with my sisters and I. I can tell there's a bit of a difference between my moms intentions and MILs but it's still annoying. (My mom felt bad after i told her MIL said the same things because she knows she's JN and doesn't want to be like that) But why is it such an issue with the grandmas and in general that generation of women? Neither of them pumped or breastfed and I think that really contributes to it. I understand they want to babysit but to me it wouldn't be normal to let my 2 month old stay the night with anyone anyways??? And mil especially wont be getting any extended ""alone time"" so she best give it up 😂 anyone else that needs to rant about this you're welcome to lol"
300,"So for the past couple of months I’ve mostly been enjoying my LO and figuring out this motherhood thing. My friends and family have been amazing. MIL has been behaving pretty well. The only person I’ve had major boundary stomping issues with has, quite unexpectedly, been SIL. Now, SIL takes after her mother in the sense that you can’t ever say anything about her own behaviour, because she’ll blow up, throw tantrums and have crying fits. It’s really interesting how SIL and MIL both recognize this behaviour in the other person but not themselves, but I digress. 

Anyway, the other day DH, LO and myself were over at the ILs for dinner and asked them for their perspective on this issue we are having with SIL. MIL mulled it over some and then said “well, see, I don’t know any of this for sure of course because I don’t really know what SIL’s motivation is. But I can imagine that since DH never indicated he had an issue and it was mainly OP’s request..” I think she realised where she was going as she was talking, because she didn’t finish her sentence and said she needed to collect her thoughts. I asked her a few minutes later what she was trying to say and she repeated the above, and then DH cut her off and said “If my sister isn’t honoring a simple request because it came from my wife and not me, that would be extremely problematic right mum, dad?! My wife is part of this family and she needs to be taken just as seriously as you take me. I won’t stand for unequal treatment just because she married in.”

I’m so relieved DH finally took a stand and spoke out! I’ve been waiting for this for a long minute. Because MIL was testing the waters and checking whether DH would agree with her that it was all no big deal, and instead she got ironclad reasoning thrown back in her face. I hope she’ll finally fucking realize that our boundaries are our boundaries, that we have a right to enforce them and we will."
301,"MIL has a long history of being an excessive, toxic, passive aggressive gifter. She used to absolutely inundate us with clutter and crap. DH has a new spine and we set a boundary this year, saying one gift per child, per birthday/holiday (they were over the top before, spoiling the kids badly). 

In the past, the gifts always arrived a month early via amazon. ALWAYS early!!!!

Two months ago on a FaceTime call, MIL made a point of saying “We’re going to HONOR your REQUEST about the gifts” (her way of verbally trying to reframe/take back control).

So today is my daughter’s birthday and yesterday she texted DH to ask if the gift had arrived yet. Nope. So here we are, and I can’t help but feel she either consciously or unconsciously waited til the last minute to mail it herself (no amazon this time), so that it wouldn’t arrive on time. 

A lot of people would think I’m crazy for being so suspicious about this but I figure people here will understand. 

I feel she is subtly punishing my daughter for my setting a boundary. The present is coming... but she won’t get to open it on her birthday... and also it will end up opened separately, away from the other family gifts, on a different day (attention). 

Just nauseating."
302,"So my family has a genetic condition we can confirm and monitor with blood tests. My mom has had the disease so she understands the test results. I bring it up as I've just had mine done, but my aunt was in the room. Aunt says not to worry as her results are similar to mine. Okay.

I walk out and mom follows me ""don't talk about that in front of aunt!""

Why, it genetic. She has it like me.

No she doesn't.

So in one interaction I was shamed about talking about a family generic condition. And my aunt is lying (who also has same fucking condition) 

Why? Why does it matter if aunt knows. It may be helpful for me to gather all information so I don't fucking worry!"
303,"TLDR of last post- basically bf wanted me to sit down with fmil and we were both going to apologise for everything and just move on. Well, that's ideally what he wanted to happen.

He approached her with this idea and she shot it down, saying she isn't ready to see me. There's a family dinner in a few nights that bf now isn't going to because she refuses to sit down with me and she wants me excluded from the dinner. She also invited his brothers partners families, behind my bfs back. He was absolutely furious. I'm not sure where we go from here? He says the ball is in her court and there's nothing else to do but continue how we are, him with low contact, and me with no contact. I just feel like she doesn't actually want to resolve things, she lives for the drama and wants someone to hate. It's just getting boring at this point, playing the wicked witch role is getting old, she needs to just get over her own issues and do what's best for her son. Any advice from someone in a similar situation? I know a lot of people think I shouldn't say sorry, but I'm willing to do it the once for my partner. I've told him it's a once off and if she continues the behaviour then we have some real issues. But she won't even meet with us to sort it out??? I'm just lost, confused and over it. If her son was important to her you'd think she would at least try. Sorry if this is messy, I just woke up and I'm still confused."
304,"Alright friends. So as you all know my MIL MitM (monkey in the middle) threw a FIT when we told her the rules for visiting our newborn. *please read that post for background* so that was a whole doozy in itself. Basically she lashed out DH stood up to her and put her in her place, she said she’d “respect our wishes”, and the fact she wasn’t respecting us was rug swept. She pretended like nothing wrong every happened. Which I’m pretty pissed about, you don’t get to just act out and then play victim.

So fast forward to the issue at hand currently. DH and I sent out a message to our families about getting the flu shot. This is the message we sent. 

“hey family!  it’s flu season! children under 5 are one of the groups most at risk of being hospitalized / dying from the flu. they are predicting a really bad flu this year. LO won’t be old enough for her flu shot until february. we’ve spoke to her pediatrician and the best way to protect her is by what they call “cocooning” (where those around her get the flu shot themselves). we acknowledge and respect that it is everyone’s own choice whether they get their flu shot or not. we respect everyone’s decision, but we’ve decided we’d rather not have anyone hold /touch LO during the holidays and throughout the flu season if they haven’t had the shot. sometimes it takes up to two weeks for the shot to build up enough antibodies, so we ask that you get it before november 14th.  if you decide to get the flu shot let me know! if not that’s totally okay, we just ask you respect this decision to try and keep her as healthy as possible. as a reminder, no kissing. we love you all!  thanks for understanding”

So that was pretty respectful in my opinion? So anywho DH sends it to MitM. At first she replies “okay cool.” then she says “well just for her help keep her home” DH replies to say that it’s not that we want to keep her at home it’s just we aren’t risking her getting sick. MitM replies “i completely understand it’s your responsibility to take care of your littles so i will respect your wishes” (if you’ve read my other post- where have we heard that before??)  So i was confused if she meant she understand she would get the shot? Or she understood and she wouldn’t hold LO? I asked him to clarify and she said she’d get it. Problem averted right? Just kidding! I wouldn’t be here if it was that simple. 

So a couple hours later she messages DH. This is how the conversation goes. 

MitM- “hey DH, i know they flu is a big deal right now and they say it’s gonna be bad but babies get sick and there isn’t anything you can do to protect them so she’s gonna get sick and when she does it’s not going to be anyone’s fault” 

DH - “yeah we know. but she’s seven weeks old and can’t fight anything off like we can.”

MitM- “ i know baby i know. i understand that we are always all going to want to protect her and i absolutely will respect your wishes but i just want you to know that kids get sick. Look at all the things that we dealt with with BIlL1 siezures and you with strep throat it just happens “
“when i get home i will send you proof that BIL2&amp;BIL3 have had their flu shot 
“i’m very proud that you are an amazing father. we’ve only seen her once for 30 minutes in the hospital and it honestly hurts my feelings but that’s besides the point.”
“so you said february so we won’t see you all for christmas either?”

DH -“no we said we’d come by before then and for christmas.”

MitM - “i guess we will see when the time comes” “i feel like i’m being asked to have my heart hardened but that’s fine i’ll  be okay”

We OBVIOUSLY know children get sick and we can’t protect her from everything. But I would fail myself if I didn’t do everything in my power to protect my baby. You don’t have to agree with my choices but at the end of the day, IM HER MOM. So if i don’t want you to hold her then that’s it. 

So what do you think? She’s blatantly not respecting our wishes right? How can you say you’ll respect it and then bitch about it? I just feel like any parenting decision we make she has a problem with and tries to tell us we are wrong, all while under the disguise of “i understand i will respect your wishes”. That’s not respecting them, right?? Am I wrong? Would you address this issue? I want to. I don’t think it’s okay to say one thing and then do the complete opposite. She doesn’t respect us as parents and need to be put in her place IMO."
305,"DH met with JNMIL about 3-4 weeks ago.  I was panicked.  I know her true colors but thought she would manipulate him back to her.

Surprisingly, she kept true to her god awful self.  She would not apologize or own any behavior.  She kept changing the subject and DH recognized it was manipulation.  My husband said he tried to own his part of the argument and asked her directly 3x to apologize to which she kept saying she did nothing wrong.  My husband eventually just stood up and left.  I was so proud of him.  

Since then, they’ve communicated by text.  She continues her rug sweeping behavior by sending texts, pics and memes.  She even asked us to go to dinner like we were besties now.  

I could tell it was still really bothering my husband so I even reached out to her and asked if she would like to meet with both of us and try one more time to reconcile.  She said she did nothing wrong.  When I explicitly explained what I’d like answers to, she says “I don’t have your answer sorry.”  I said only you have these answers and you can’t move on without explaining.  She got mad and told me to “give it up.”
 
The next morning text that when DH and I are “ready to stop this stupidity” then maybe she will try to take baby steps to reconcile with us, but she’s never talking about the past with us again.  DH told her that we aren’t moving on without this discussion and not to contact until she’s ready to do so.  (Sidebar- she’s had this happen with SIL before) She said “do you think I’d have a relationship with SIL if we rehashed everything?  You just have to move on.”  DH said no more rug sweeping.  She said that’s the only way and she will never talk to us about this again.

I’m so proud of DH but I’m also heartbroken for him.  He’s going to therapy but I wondered are there any resource I can give him like a book that talks about these hard relationships?  I found the missing missing reasons page and I think that site helped him see he isn’t being unreasonable asking for her to own her actions and apologize.  

Thanks for the support along the way.  I know this isn’t over but I feel a little more at peace for some reason."
306,"FH and I waited until our 12 week scan before telling anyone our good news. When we told his parents, we also told them we'd be finding out the sex at 20 weeks and JNMIL immediately told us she doesn't want to find out. I really don't understand this logic anyway because 1) why would you want to be the only person not to know and 2) how does it impact her anyway?!

Well we know the sex now and are crazy excited. I bought a couple of gender specific bits after we found out and I'll get more today just because I can! The problem is, JNILs are coming to stay for a few days soon so JNMIL will probably expect me to to hide any giveaways and resume saying it instead of s/he. I'm obviously not willing to do this because why the hell should I - it's MY baby, MY house, and I love not having to say it. So that'll probably cause extra amniosity. But even if they weren't staying, FH has her on fb so we'd have to make sure never to put anything on there or tag each other in anything that hints at the sex. This is my first child and it's the sex I was hoping for so I have absolutely no interest in censoring my life just for her. If I want to tag FH in a meme about about fathers and their son/daughter then I should be able to! Not think ""uh oh JN might see so I'd better not"".

I am going to let FH know I'm not pandering to his mum. All this only really occurred to me now and he's at work but I needed somewhere to vent!

Probably worth adding that his parents don't live near us so contact is already minimal but, now I'm a human incubator, I get the impression that I'll be seeing a lot more of them.."
307,"Hi, I'm a lurker on a throwaway and I don't even know if this post is ok here but I've been reading the posts on here and it's honestly so cathartic! I relate so hard and I just need to vent really badly. So, apologies if this isn't an ok post! Also I'm sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile.


I'm also sorry that is so unforgivably long.




My SO has no contact with his mother; he was basically raised by his uncle and grandmother. I joke that his uncle is my MIL but it's really his grandmother filling that role. 




GMIL has hated me since day 1. She blames me for SO pulling away from her, yadda yadda, pretty standard JN stuff I think. She showed up halfway through our wedding ceremony and marched in with 15 uninvited guests (kinda a big deal, we had a guest list of 100 and we made the food ourselves).  I could go on about the insane crap she's pulled for infinity but I'm trying to keep this (relatively) short. On the other hand, at times she has been incredibly generous; she bought my SO a house while he was in college, and put him on the deed as 50% owner. She's a multi-millionaire and has bought all of her grandchildren houses, cars, etc... But none of the things she buys them are ever ""theirs."" They're always hers, to take back as she pleases, if they piss her off. It's a weird situation to be in because my SO feels like he has to be grateful, but at the same time, he feels like he has to do everything she wants.



And she doesn't want me.



Nobody in SO's entire family stays married. Like, NOBODY. The norm in their family is to get married, have a couple kids, then kick the spouse out and get full custody (sometimes lying in court, backed by GMIL's personal lawyer) and then all live together. They own over 20 houses between them, and they all live together and rotate which house they stay in (all being GMIL, uncle, cousins, cousins' kids).



Way before he ever met me, SO decided he wasn't into this, and wanted to have ""his own"" family. He doesn't think their dynamic is creepy the way I do, but he just knew it wasn't what he wanted. He already lived 2 hours from them. So when we got engaged, GMIL threw a fit and accused me (to SO, not to me, I didn't find out til later) of only marrying him because of his house. She insisted we sign a prenup, which I was fine with. 


So here is where the trouble started: I got pregnant. 



We only occupied one floor of the house, the other being used as a rental, and the area we were in had 2 bedrooms. One of the bedrooms was SOs, and one was Uncle's. It was full of Uncle's stuff, and it stayed locked 100% of the time. No one was allowed to go in it. Bear in mind, Uncle in no way, shape, or form, lived there. He lived over 2 hours away, in multiple homes. He also NEVER visited us. Not one time in our marriage did he come up and use that room. I was pregnant and feeling nesty, so I wanted to ask about clearing out the room to turn into a nursery, and SO got... Weird. Evasive. Cranky. Totally out of character for my open, kind, affectionate hubby. I asked if we could paint the bathroom. Same reaction. I asked if we could change the curtains. Same. Finally it came out that he didn't want to change a single thing about the house for fear of infuriating his grandmother. More than half the space in the house was taken up by furnishings I'd been assuming were SOs, but were actually GMIL's, Uncle's, and Significant Female Cousin's. So despite the fact that they now never visited, because they hated me, our house had to be a shrine to their tacky taste and impractical decor.




Cranky, pregnant, newly-moved-in newlywed me was not going to let that stand for long. Maybe I came on too strong but in my mind, we were either going to live our lives in that house, or we were going to have to move. SO ended up agreeing, albeit reluctantly. He asked Uncle about clearing out that room and HOO BOY did that set off a firestorm. Every member of SOs family was messaging him, calling him, telling him what a disloyal and ungrateful jerk he was, that he was burning bridges over some ""skank"" that wouldn't even stick around, and other various insults about what a bad choice they all thought he made in me. 



So we didn't clean out the room. We had the baby, and she slept in our one tiny bedroom, while the other room sat, unused and unopened. As a compromise, SO agreed to let me redecorate and rearrange the rest of the house, but it was slow going and every decision felt like a fight. Every time I brought up the room, he fought me, saying he didn't want to hurt Uncle's feelings. This just made no sense to me. Who thinks they have the absolute right to complete ownership of a room in someone else's house, that they never visit, never use, and barely speak to?? How would his uncle even use the room, since it was attached to a house containing me, who he wanted to avoid? 



So, when our oldest was 10 months old, we got pregnant again, and I lost my mind. I picked the lock and started boxing stuff in that room up because I hadn't had a good night's sleep in 10 months and now I was pregnant again and just not having two babies in our bedroom. I'm a SAHM (another thing his family disapproves of) and at some point in the day, I need a break! SO started helping me and agreed that Uncle had known how we felt, and had been asked repeatedly to come get his stuff, so it was reasonable. We cleared it out in 1 day, stored the stuff very carefully in the garage, and set up the dual nursery. And I was happy in that house for the first time. I felt like we actually had a place to live for the first time.



Until GMIL found out. After DD2 was born, the beans were spilled about the nursery. She reamed SO out, telling him he had no right to use that room and that he needed to ""find somewhere else"" to put his children. Around this time Female Cousin also started making a lot of really strange comments to SO, about how she couldn't wait ""til you move back"" and how my daughters liked her more than they liked me and that would be good for when they all lived together. I was confused about these comments at the time, having not yet caught on to how NOPE they were. 




Then I realized that she, and the whole family, viewed me as a completely temporary inconvenience, and that they all assumed I'd show up for a year or two, lend my outside genetic material, and then evaporate. Looking back I don't know why I was surprised; that's their normal. 



SO took GMIL at her word, and we began the process of moving. She was outraged when she found out we were moving, and threatened to sell the house. SO said, ""sell it, why would I care, you made it clear it's not my house."" She denied ever intending to kick us out, but also sent an extremely cruel letter calling my husband a lazy failure and irresponsible (could not be farther from accurate) and telling him to move out. She even went so far as to have eviction notices tacked all over the house, referring to my SO by name and me and the babies as ""John Does 1-3"". (These were just filled out by her and not legally binding in any way, because my SO is on the deed!!) We were in the process of moving out, because it was just too much mental stress to stay there, no matter what the legality, when she sent workers who cleaned out the rest of the house and took everything to the dump. They made a point of busting up my furniture and leaving it out next to trash cans. This is a woman who hoards EVERYTHING, who never met a piece of crap she wouldn't keep, and she took clothes, toys, books, furniture, mementos, most of it in totally good condition, and threw it out. There's a thrift store that's always taking donations just a couple of streets over from our house, and she would have had to drive PAST that to take it to the dump. But of course if she'd taken it there, there'd be a chance we could get it back, and she couldn't have that. Then she changed the locks. When SO called to confront her about it, she said that she never told him to move so she assumed that he was abandoning the property (clearly a lie) and that we'd had ""plenty of time"" to get out since she told us to move. In my opinion, she's clearly getting on in age and not fully ""with it"". Either that or she's just the least reasonable person I've ever met.


I'm still shaken and upset by the loss of my things. About half of my clothes, my girls' baby clothes, and our furniture, is gone, and it's not like we can afford to replace it all; my husband sacrificed years of his life caring for his sick grandfather, until he passed away, and doing the bidding of GMIL-- for no pay, of course, just the promise of the house. So he doesn't have much work experience, and jobs in the field he got a degree in are hard to find. Anyway I'm not complaining about that, we definitely made our own bed on that one and we've both accepted that money will be tight because we had 2 kids so quickly. Still, we're so happy together, as long as we're not thinking about his family. But sometimes I still get angry. SO technically has legal grounds, I think, to press charges for loss of property, and for changing the locks, which is illegally barring one owner from using the property, but he just has no energy or desire to fight it. He's seen GMIL's lawyer get her off when she broke the law so many times, he says it would absolutely not be worth it and that we're better off just walking away. I agree, but I still just get  angry about all of it sometimes. Especially since we found out recently that she's selling the house, and planning to give the money to my SO's estranged drug addict, con artist mother, which feels like an extra ""eff you"" to him. 


And then SO has the gall to suggest we go visit them for the holidays, or feels bad that they don't get to see our daughters, and I want to rip my hair out. I've tried to get him to see what an impossible situation that is for me. How am I supposed to be around people who hate me, who threw away my daughters' toys, who called me a skank, who took away our home? How can I take my family around people who don't even want it to exist and are just waiting for me to disappear? Sometimes I feel guilty, like I really am in the wrong, and I got in the way of this close-knit family. 



TL;DR: GMIL buys SO house, kicks him out of it for getting married, I'm not over it.

Sorry again for this being long. I hope it's not considered off-topic. I'd love advice.


Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented. It helps a lot. I should have stated that I'm not really looking for legal advice at this point, since for our own sanity we'd rather walk away, but I get where you're coming from and appreciate it. I was more looking for advice on how to move on, and whether we should still interact with them on any level. I want to clarify some things with regards to my SO-- he's not spineless or weaselly, he's incredibly strong and devoted to our children and to me. Nothing in life is ever certain, but him leaving me would genuinely shock me. We are in love and have been for years, so I have no plans to find a divorce lawyer or anything like that. It's hard to communicate a whole relationship in an online post, even a really long one, but this is absolutely not a man who considers me a meat shield, or disposable. This man would walk through fire for me and/or our kids. He has verbally stood up to JNGMIL, but doesn't want to pursue legal action for reasons stated in the post and comments. Again, thank you all for the support."
308,"Just some mild BEC. 

I'm going to preface this with the fact that I do like my GMIL. She has a heart of gold and is really very sweet. Just a little dense and the epitome of ""old people fbook"" 
I get along with her just fine, she's a wonderful grandmother and great grandmother. DD is also the first grandchild/great-grandchild on both sides. 

To start, I've had to start sending her videos instead of pictures of DD, because within 5 minutes, she'll have it posted. I didn't want to post a picture of **MY** daughter, thanks /s (it wouldn't be so bad if she tagged me in the post or something, but no). I also decided just to post any pictures on my own profile, and tag her (and my mom, MIL, SIL, my grandmother and grandfather). Just makes it all easier. 

So I had people comment how beautiful my daughter is, how sweet etc. GMIL was replying to comments saying ""thank you""... ? I mean okay, but that little person came from me, not you.. shouldn't it be *me* saying thank you? 
Out of two dozen comments, 10 alone were from her.. 

I loves ya, Nan, but get off Facebook for a day or two would you?

*Sigh* 

( *Like I said, she's not a JustNo, she's a retired, sweet little old lady with the power of social media in her palm. Dangerous things that make my brain go fuzzy when I see her post online* )"
309,"Hi I’m new. This happened at 10:30am, it’s now 3:20am the next day and I can’t sleep because I’m still so mad and have to head back to the hospital in the morning. I’ll keep this short, I just need to vent. 

My husband needed a surgery to remove a goiter that had grown into his chest.  It was supposed to be a major surgery with a long recovery and 4-5 days in the hospital. We asked MIL to come help when he comes home from the hospital in a few days. She is a nurse so I told her she would be most helpful when we come home. While he’s in the hospital he’s being well taken care of. She pushed about wanting to come for a lengthy visit to “help” and wanted to be there for the surgery, but we said we would prefer her to wait and she agreed. I should have known better. She waited until I told her the surgery started so my husband couldn’t say no anymore and then called to tell me she booked a flight to come the next day. I went insane on her, I honestly can’t even remember what I said exactly. I think I told her I am sick of her being sneaky and that I can’t believe she did this and that she is making everything even worse for me as far as stress about waiting during the surgery. I finally stopped word vomiting all over her and she just says, “ok, so can I come tomorrow?”  I said I would call her later and I couldn’t deal with this right now. Thank God my husband’s surgery went fine and actually ended up being much much less invasive than expected. When I called to update I was just so freaking happy that the surgery was over and went well that I said she could come. Now that the high of the good news has worn off I’m back to a full rage over this. 

I posted about this in a FB group Im in, unrelated to MILs and got told I’m wrong for not letting her be there for surgery. That I must not be a mom (I am) and no one would EVER keep them from their sons. Good luck to those FDIL. I got chastised for worrying about her instead of my husband. So, I guess they all think it’s ok to lie and manipulate to get what you want?  It’s ok to add stress to a stressful situation and show up days before you were invited? Or am I really the messed up one for not letting her come for a surgery?  I could go on and on, but that’s the gist of it.

Edited for additional details:

I did not describe the situation in full detail when I shared this. We informed her what was going on and she asked if she could come. We never asked her to come at all, but we did say she could come and to wait to make plans until we knew the details. When we got the details...date, time, expected days in hospital, expected recovery time at home she said she could take two weeks off. We decided two weeks is too much time, but that we would let her come for one week. We let her come because she is his mom and we didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but to be honest we did not want her at all. She’s too stressful for both of us to be around. So we were putting our feelings aside to be kind to her even though my husband was the one having the surgery. We decided that the one week that would be the most “helpful” would be when he was home. I’m not sure if those details make a difference to those that think she should have been there, but there ya go✌️"
310,"AV texted me asking if it would be okay to get our baby a bouncer because she wants to go shopping soon. She knows it is not my designated reply day, but I had no intention of using a bouncer or similar items after the rock n play was recalled (yes, I know it was user error but who can say I'm not going to be dog tired one day and mess up). I don't want her picking things out not on our registry since I've done my safety research on those items. DH says we're not in a position to turn down free stuff, and he's right on that. I just don't want things that I haven't gotten a chance to research."
311,"So it's the week before the wedding and my mother has pulled her head out of her arse and started helping. I have to wear the dress she got now because my baby bump exploded. Yesterday she had a spat with her husband, my dad, and threatened to divorce him because he called her out on being selfish and lying to him. Irony is she was bringing up issues from ten plus years ago as reasons but her cheating and aborting the child her and her lover conceived to cover up her irresponsibility (which my father has zero clue about) is 100% not applicable in this situation in her eyes - I told her that if she was going to seriously divorce my dad then he has a right to know how badly she fucked up. Today she decides to come up to FINALLY sort the bridal party flowers. The florists gave her an earful about leaving it so late which was a huge win in my eyes, but she proceeds to do something both FDH and I think is horrendous. She takes out a photo of the last ultrasound of FDH and my own son and shows the florists. We're both absolutely gobsmacked. I was mentally and physically abused by one of her friends as a child and as a result am highly protective of my son. I'm only just learning now not to repress the awful things she does so it's taken this long to process that it's not okay. I'm going to be having words about this tomorrow and am fully expecting to be called ungrateful and overprotective. Her grandparent privileges are already severely reduced for allowing me to be mentally and physically abused for 17 years but this may be the end of her photo privileges. 

On a lighter note, FDH and I are considering sending her a glitter bomb every time she threatens my dad with divorce and tries to drag me into the middle of it."
312,"Oh my goodness this is getting old. We had the whole previous drama that was ridiculous but it was finally over more or less. We went to visit JNMIL and JNFIL and the rest of DHs family for a family reunion. It seemed pleasant and like all was well again. Apparently not. As I mentioned before they gave us lots of “gifts.” Which is what I thought they were. This included buying us a new car. They offered it completely on their own. We didn’t ask for it but accepted it, which I now realize was a complete mistake. We used the car in a cross country move so we have it several states away. A couple days ago they let us know that since DH isn’t planning on finishing his degree (he is but we are taking a break to get settled financially) we now need to take on the car loan. I had absolutely no idea that the car was given to us on the condition that he returned to school in the fall or I would have flat out said no. We are in no position to pay for a car and won’t even get approved for a loan. I feel like this is my fault for even accepting this stupid “gift” but it was before i noticed just how JN they were. I want to just drive the car back to them and leave it in their driveway to deal with but we can’t afford another car anytime soon. It is such a mess to be entangled financially with In-laws. DONT DO IT. I’m guessing JNMIL and JNFIL will say we can pay them to put the money towards the car loan but that sounds worse to me than not having a car at all. We decided to move last minute and DHs parents decided to buy us a car last minute but I kind of feel like they are trying to manipulate the situation so that DH goes back to school and we move back closer to them and bring the first grand baby back to them. It’s almost like they can tell when we are extremely vulnerable (just barely had a new baby, rough financial situation), swoop in and offer to do something nice and then a little bit later decide to cash in on those supposed “gifts” I don’t want to demonize them and want DH to have a good relationship with them if he wants to but I feel like I keep falling into their traps"
313,"Y’all have read about my MIL. This little (big? Huge? Muy grande?) rant is about my LOVELY bio mother. 

Before you read on, I’ve done over a decade of different kids of therapy and have worked out the trauma. I’m very open about my story. 

Trigger warning: sexual abuse mentioned below. 


When I was a wee little babe, around 4, my bio father began molesting me. It went on happening weekly or bi-weekly until I was 12 years old. Something in me snapped after 8 years of abuse and I realized that what was happening WAS wrong and wasn’t normal and not every daddy loved their daughters that way. I had two younger siblings in the home and two older half siblings, related by mom. 

After 8 years, at 12 years old, I disclosed about being molested. 

Shit hit the fan. 

I wasn’t home when I chose to disclose. My father was promptly questioned and arrested. He was bailed out by mommy-dearest. My mother, not believing me and telling EVERYONE that I was narcissistic and simply angry with the family for enforcing rules (wut.), supported him and his relationship with the younger kids. 

He was eventually sent to prison with a 12 year sentence. About 6 years in he won an appeal and the DA felt as though they wouldn’t win a second trial now that I was a grown woman and did not hold the same emotional appeal to a jury offer him a plea bargain: 3 felony counts: 2 different charges of statutory rape, and deceit with intent to harm a minor. He was allowed to buy a house next door to the local elementary school and did not have to register as a sex offender. He obviously took it. 

My mother had remained married to him and resumed her life with him. My younger siblings - then almost adults - also chose to resume their relationships with him. They had never believed me. 

My older siblings however did. We had maintained strict NC with my mother. Her and I attempted reconciliation, but it ended in disaster and she was escorted out of more than a few therapists offices. My older sister defended me. 

I moved across the country to be closer to my older sister and be away from mother. Sister now has 3 kids and her husband encouraged her to allow mother to be in their lives - however limited. 

Mother recently announced (now that bio dad has been dead for 3 years) that she’s moving across the country to be nearer to the kids. I talked to my sister about it who told me that she was furious she would do that as she didn’t want we kids to have a close relationship with her. She maintained this stance for months. 

Yesterday, my grandmother called me to tell me that mother bought a house and sister was upset at how far the home was away from her, that sister has been buying plane tickets for mother to come out multiple times per year to see the kids, that they (sister and BIL) found the house for her, but didn’t think she’d buy it, and also found her a stable full-time job. Grandma said sister has been in regular contact with mother for months now and they’ve resumed their relationship. Mother is now asking where I live and where my husband and I will be buying our home so she can plan to see it and spend time with me in it because MY SISTER TOLD HER THAT IVE BEEN WANTING TO RECONCILE NOW THAT IM OLDER. Oh, and my grandma will be moving in with mother because she can’t afford the entire mortgage comfortably. 

I realize that I can’t control everyone, I do, but I am so massively hurt by the way everyone has handled this. The damage was done to me, but fuck do I feel alone right now. My sister was really all the solidarity I had from my blood family and to find out that not only is that no longer true, but she’d been straight-up lying to me about it is so incredibly hurtful. 

My husband has, of course, vented more anger than I have because he has to sit and watch the effects as the little bit of family I had left crumbles away - and just before the holidays, too, which is already a REALLY hard time for me. He has said that he no longer wants to interact with sister and BIL because he doesn’t think he’ll be able to respect them any more. I’m choosing to try my hardest to ignore it in order to keep my relationship with her babies. 

Sorry for the likely nonsense garble. I needed to vent. 

I’m blessed to have been adopted by a wonderful family a couple years ago (as an adult from the foster care system), but I will never have that parental bond with them. 

Life is such a strange adventure."
314,"Still working on getting the hang of this but looking to wrap my brain around some behaviors and make sure I’m set up for future issues.. PS, on mobile. Not sure what that means but I keep seeing people including it so figured I should too. PPS, obligatory might be a long post. 
So my MIL isn’t exactly a JN but not exactly a JY either.. DH and I have been together for almost 4 years and married for just over 1, we are also 35 weeks pregnant and so getting super close to due date. Well way back at the beginning of the pregnancy, we planned to tell my mom and dad of the baby on my moms birthday. I wanted to keep things fair and so we sent a package to MIL telling her too. We included messages with both gifts saying we’d like to wait to tell the rest of the world as we were still fairly early on and weren’t quite ready to tell everyone else yet. Now my parents were understandably excited and would have loved to tell all my aunts and uncles (my mom has 8 brothers and sisters) but they respected our wishes and kept it a secret. MIL apparently didn’t think that “please don’t tell anyone” included her sister or her mother or her nephew... thankfully we were able to contain it to just those people and double thankfully, my DH was just as irritated by it as I was (new mom hormones means I cried for like 2 days about it and still get irritated now) DH kinda yelled at her but I don’t think she understood that she did anything wrong. Whatever at this point. 
Now DH and I live in the Midwest and MIL lives on the east coast so I’ve only actually met her three times in the 4 years. DH and her talk on the phone every week but I’m not always available for the conversations. Not really gonna complain about that. But anyways when she was most recently visiting, she brought up coming to visit after LO is born and how she is going to want to set up FaceTime calls so baby will be able to know grandma. I said that would be fine and we can get her IPad set up when she comes down to visit. (She’s not super tech savvy and I don’t know if she could figure it out on her own) Well just today, I learn that her and her husband are going on a cruise the week before we are due to deliver baby and now she might not be able to make it out to visit us until late January or February. Seems a little bit of a strange priority but maybe the cruise was booked before we announced the baby? (I don’t really think so but again, whatever..) My fear now, is that if she isn’t coming until Feb. I’m going to be heading back to work around that point, babe is going to be starting daycare, and then what? What if she asks if she can just watch babe at home for us (for the week she’d be staying with us) instead of sending LO to daycare? I don’t know if I really know or trust her enough for that? Plus we would just be getting to the point of getting back into a routine and it would be thrown all out of wack again. And last time she was here, she complained quite a few times about my having to work so much while she was in town. (I had a major project going out the day after she left, literally nothing else I could do to change anything). I know it doesn’t really due to worry about things until they happen but I’ve already been dealing with anxiety issues even before getting pregnant and all the extra hormones aren’t helping. 
Also, my parents came to visit this past weekend (they live about 2.5 hours away and are very much JYParents) Well they went into the nursery (which is very gender specific and we haven’t told anyone the gender prior to this. I do trust them not to tell anyone else though). And it might be a little petty but I don’t feel the least bit guilty about not telling MIL the gender in order to keep things “fair”. DH supports me 100% in this and I love that I can count on him to back me."
315,"Had some issues with MIL in the past which are resolving over time. She's not a mean-spirited person, just kind of unaware of her behaviors. Definitely has narcissistic tendencies (pay attention to me, look at the great stuff I do, I am right cause I'm the mom, blaming DH for a number of irrelevant things)...

But she's recently, within the past year or two, had a lot of very random health issues pop up which affect her energy, muscles, etc. I believe she is completely telling the truth (I've seen the issues in person) though I worry the doctors' diagnoses are not as thorough as I'd like (she's taking a shit ton of meds and is not even 60 yet). 

So today wasn't the first time, but she's told DH a few times now that she is done and wants to die. I get she's upset and doesn't feel well all the time but is this something that a typical mom does? He's obviously beside himself dwelling on this and I am angry at her (I think?) because this is something I believe she should be sharing with her husband or therapist, not with her son. There have been definite signs in the past of a little bit of emotional incest (oversharing with DH, acting like she should join  him for 'friend' events, telling him she's always lonely). 

So, just looking for insight for those who deal with parents dropping too much emotional baggage. Is it okay that she's telling DH she wants to die or is that something that she really should be discussing with more appropriate people like FIL or a therapist (the latter of whom she refuses to speak to)?"
316,"Ok so to start off I will say that I am ADD, so I apologize if this post is all over the place.

I live with my boyfriend and his mother. She has a strong personality and clashes with just about everyone. When I first got here and she realized me and SO were in a relationship she sat us down and started talking about how no one will take her kids away from her. He is 23 and her oldest is 37. They are not kids anymore, not that I’m trying to steal him from her. I’ve had many opportunities where me and him could move states away to be with my family but I didn’t do it. She is a very toxic person and plays games way too much. She likes to move my things and post subliminal messages about me on Facebook and lie about it. My SO knows how she is but has lived with it his whole life so he is used to it. 

Currently me and my boyfriend are not speaking with her because this has been going on for far to long and we confronted her about it. She lied about the whole thing. She doesn’t think I’m smart enough to notice her bullshit. She’s the type to complain about everything that happens in her life. So when she said the post was about something else I knew it wasn’t because 1. I’ve never heard those names before and 2. She hadn’t complained about it. The night we had the conversation, confronting her, she confirmed that she had a hand in a lot of things that had happened previously between me and other people. Those things left a mark on me emotionally. She doesn’t care. She even said that she wanted me out of her house, and that if my boyfriend agreed then he could go to. But his name is on the lease with her. 

I’ve lived here for over a year. I had a job but it fell through so I’ve basically been a housewife and job searching for months. Problem is, where we live there aren’t many jobs. My boyfriend has been very understanding because he sees all the work I’ve put in. In fact I have an interview in a couple of days. She says that I haven’t been doing anything around the house and that I need a job if I want to live here. My boyfriend disagreed with her. He has been paying for all of my bills which I hate because that’s something I should be able to do. She asked me if I even feel guilty. I said yes and asked her if she feels guilty for letting her son pay majority of her bills while she stills owes him over $200. He’s too nice to collect. She says he gets paid more than her so he can afford it. 

I’m really just over living with her. She doesn’t care about anyone but herself. Her recliner is even in my name because her credit was to bad to get a new one. I’ve been severely depressed and anxious for the past six months or more because of everything that’s going on. I really hope I get this job because when that happens me and him can begin to move out and start our own life together free of the drama and games.

Oh and because she says I have not integrity or respect. She says I only do things when people are looking so I look good. So I am stopping. I don’t say hi or even look at her. I don’t thank her for anything, not that there’s anything to thank her for. I don’t wash dishes, clean bathrooms, take out the trash, sweep or mop, vacuum, or do anything that makes life easier for her at all. Since I’ve stopped, the house is an absolute disaster. The garbage cans outside are full because she won’t take them to the end of the driveway, which I did every night on sundays. It’s stopping now. It’s like I’m not even here. 

The irony in this whole post is that in the beginning she said no one will steal her kids from her. But now I’ve realized she runs them off anyway."
317,"Hello my fellow Reddit peeps with crappy MILs and Moms! It's-a-me, the Catmother! 😅 

Things have been quiet on the Spare the Rod front. Her birthday was last month, DH and I just bought a cake and had a 15 min visit. It was GRRREAT! As per my therapist's advice, I am only visiting her when I feel ready, which has basically led us to be VVVVLC. As usual, my useless siblings didn't do shit for her birthday and my younger JNB tried to hop along the cake idea and present it as him being onboard all along...

HAHAHAHAHA... NO....

Anywho, just as an FYI, I have a long ass commute. I usually spend three to four hours each day commuting to and from work. Why? Because I love that we live in the middle of nowhere and it gives my introvert ass the perfect excuse to bail out of social engagements!  Work party? Sorry, I live really far. Annoying social gathering? Sorry, I woke up at 4:40 a.m. today and I am SOOO tired. This is relevant, I swear.

This was a rough week for DH. He suffers from severe anxiety and he has been under medication for several months. He had a crisis on Tuesday and got sent home on sick leave for three days. I did the commute alone on Wednesday because I didn't have to drive (here in my country you are forbidden from driving solo or without a full car depending on the last digit of your plate. My day are Wednesdays), but I decided to WFH on Thursday because it has been raining like crazy lately and I didn't want to do the 2+ hour drive alone in the pouring rain.

So where does STR come in all this? She texts me on Thursday around noon, asking at what time I arrived at my hometown. I answered back saying I was WFH and asked why. Her response?

""I wanted to go out for coffee""

Here is where the success part comes to fore. I told her no, because a) I was tired, b) I had to work the next day and c) I did not appreciate such a short notice on plans. I also outlined that if she wanted to hang out, please let me know several days in advance so I can check my availability, because you know... I kinda have to work....

Her response?

""But your sister is coming!""

This is what she actually meant:

""Your sister is coming. You know? The GC who actually gave ME GRANDBABIEEEESS and works HARDER THAN YOU because she has BABIEEEESS and who is my perfect child because she stayed in church and remained obediently married to a cheater and an abusive man that is God's leader in church. You cannot possibly say you are busy, because you don't have or want BABIEEES and you don't make time for MEEEEEE""

My response?

""Good for her"""
318,"Spoiler: the guest list doesn’t change any time she asks me. 

Wanderer is my JNMum who left me and my two older brothers (B1 and B2) when we were teens until just before Christmas 2017. 

FDH’s JYMum invites us over for dinner because FDH was supposed to help her move shit but we keep forgetting every time. I asked JYMIL if Wanderer was invited, she said she could be, so I invited her along. 

I know she’s been stressed with a whole bunch of things recently and needs a short break. 

FDH heads out first to make sure he helps his mum and I head out with Wanderer after she gets to our place. 

She mentions she’s got until next Monday (28/10) to move out of her home and she’s desperate. I thought about telling her she could sleep on our couch to lessen her stress, but that’d kill me from stress and we just don’t have the space. I didn’t even bring the idea up to FDH until I told him about Wanderer’s situation and that I thought of a terrible idea even I turned down. 

Onto the story though... 

She asked me who was invited from our side of the family. I have a mantra now; siblings, parents, grandparents. 

Wanderer asked if I’d be inviting my Godmother. (Enter mantra). She then asked if I’d be inviting my older Godmother (I have 2, mother and daughter) as I won’t have my grandparents there. 

I don’t have her parents and JYDad’s parents can’t come (from home country) as they’re not well enough, but I do have Stepmum’s (Lady Menopause’s) parents. They’re my grandparents too. 

I told Wanderer this and repeated the mantra. 

She asked a couple more times before I told her to just cut it out because it’s annoying. 

Didn’t bring it up again. 

On a completely separate note, when FDH and I saw JYDad and Lady Menopause the other day, they both mentioned wanting to speak with me alone in regards to paying for something to do with our wedding. As to why they don’t want FDH there, I don’t know, but I called JYDad and told him FDH could drop me off before our movie session tomorrow and we could talk then. JYDad might be working till just before, so we’re not sure. It’ll happen at some point and it’ll be nice to have a bit of money pressure taken off. I will make sure they know there will be no strings attached though."
319,"JNMIL has been call DH leaving messages stating “I miss you” “I’ll keep calling  I speak to you” 

As a pre curser DH went NC with his parents after the realization that they have made zero effort in trying to be involved in his life since he moved out and in with me Three years ago. 

DH didn’t tell his parents anything he just asked for time and space. (This was in April) 

So today for about 2 hours he and I sat and talked about calling. He had a bathroom panic attack and then made the call. He chose to have the phone on speaker (husband has sever social anxiety and majority of the NC is DH has been so anxious over speaking to his parents he gets
Physically ill) 

Once JNMIL realized she was on speaker (.30seconds in) she became demanding “could
I please speak to you privately, after all I did call to speak to MY son” (I frankly didn’t give a crap) 

She told him how the past 4 months have been terrible for her and what ever she did or said that she was sorry. 

      -before the call I let DH know since
They have zero idea what is going on they will be accusing me of the rift, and encouraging him to
Cut them out.  Her response to being on speaker seemed To be a confirmation of that theory. 


So he told her that them as parents failed him by not treating their children different and that he has a medical diagnosis for anxiety that if they would have believed his behavior as an illness and not “acting out” that he would have been able to be treated earlier and get counseling.  There is more but it’s personal. 

She did blame me for not sitting down and talking about things the last time
I saw them (she made it sound like my family emergency trip down there was me treating their house like a revolving door... a 7hr drive with a 1yr old both ways over three days.) I reminded her that her and her husband were adults and I’m not responsible to read their minds and guess what they want. 

So just a rant I guess"
320,"Hi Redditors,

my FJNMIL is honestly the most cunning and manipulative woman i know. she will never come off as a b**** because she talks sweet and knows how to shut people up indirectly with the way she talks.

Backstory : FMIL and ex husband were married and had my FDH. They divorced when FDH was 3 months old. He had never met his father and as per his mom his bio dad never wanted to stay in touch. idk if i 100% believe it because FMIL lies too much to make herself seem like the victim. Anyways, they stay no contact till he turns 25. (now in another country) They talk on/off. FDH kinda hated his dad but also stayed in touch until he was told that FMIL’s family (brothers specially) were so hurt that they were there as a father figure to FDH yes he still wants to stay in touch. Basically emotionally blackmailed FDH to cut off contact. Bio Dad died a year later. FDH has younger under 18 half siblings. FDH wishes he at least met his father once. He hated him growing up but then understood life and realized he wasn’t as terrible.

Current issue. After Bio dad passed away a few months ago, the kids have been broke. (FYI FDH hasn’t met these kids they just talk online on/off) FDH i suppose helped a couple times but not as such cause he doesn’t believe he deserves to be given a responsibility of 4 kids when he didnt even know they existed for most of his life. I don’t disagree. FDH said he would help as much as he is comfortable with.
Now FMIL calls me and plays victim again and wants to be “good in front of God” by sending them money. she is very proud and likes to show off her money. FDH said no and said its his family and if he wants he will take care of them. Her brothers said no. She called me yesterday and asked me that she needs me to stay quiet and secretly send money to the kids through my app so FDH doesn’t find out. We don’t go through each others phones. Anyways, I told her i’m not comfortable lying to FDH and he will be too hurt. If she wants me to help her with something she needs to ask in front of FDH. 
Also over the phone she said “The watch ur parents gave my son as an engagement present was so beautiful. I got the same brand watch for my mom from Walmart - trying to show that my parents didn’t give a pricey present. It was $500 btw”
Also mentioned “Since FDH is out this weekend, she will call me to check up on him”. Very intrusive in his life. I told her “Oh MIL i wish i were lucky enough to know his whereabouts, we give each other space when we’re OT with friends” 
Ugh and other things that were so cringe. She constantly tells me how FDH and her are so close and do cute stuff. Kinda really cringe to me because its couple-y stuff she talks about. Legit was telling me when she used to drive to see FDH in his old city they would fall asleep on the couch watching TV and she would then put a blanket on him when it would be cold. ????? ew

I’m just so fucking mad at the money transfer situation though!!!! like why would you want to do it in the first place AND then lie about it to your OWN son. 

FYI: She’s been married to a loaded af guy for the past 15 years. He is very sweet and caring and mostly unaware of all these things she does."
321,"No advice needed....I have put up with her for 40 years!

My MIL is a widow and treats my husband like a surrogate husband.  She had been complaining of a cold and cough for 24 hours and was upset about ""not getting better""...because colds do not last more than 24 hours in her world.  My DH made the mistake of telling her we were going to the emergency room where they had just air lifted my critically ill brother.

I was up over 24 hours with my brother in his ICU room  and get a text from a FM that they were taking my MIL to the emergency room for her cough. I said ""OK, thanks for taking care of her....let me know if they keep her""...they knew I was with my brother who had nearly died...shocked his heart 3 times!

I found out the next day that the FM's were ""appalled"" we did not leave my brother's side and go the ER.  News flash ...they did not admit her to the hospital.  When I finally went over to see her at her house the next day...she was too weak to go to the store...she almost starved to death in her home with a full pantry and refrigerator.

DH thinks she purposely escalated her illness to see what he would do....stay with me or go to her? Nope...he stayed with me.....he thought she was being ridiculous. She  is so jealous of my family and there has always been this underlying competition with me.

I reviewed her ER visit paperwork....chief complaint ....cough....discharge diagnosis....cough....no pneumonia, nothing!! I called her out on letting FM text me when she knew I had been up over 24 hours ....and she said, "" I might have overreacted...I just did not know if I would ever feel better.""

Guess what?? She now feels better and was off to play cards....common cold...last 3 days! We were supposed to drop everything and go to her side? Nope.....success!

EDIT: my brother gave us quite the scare and will need medication the rest of his life...he is doing very well...thank you all for your concern...love this subreddit!!!"
322,"LTL, FTP. Buckle the fuck up kiddo's, its gonna be a wild ride, and long as hell. Worth it in the end, though.

&amp;#x200B;

 I need to preface this by stating that this ensuing story specifically deals with my sister, though somehow I got dragged into everything and am now in time out with my VLC parents. Not that I give that first shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I should start by explaining about my mother. Due to her own shitty childhood involving a murdered mother and the subsequent  14 years in foster homes, my mom has always been very protective and overly involved/opinionated in her three children's lives. However, since adulthood, my mother has never been able to have successful, healthy relationships with all three of us at the same time; one of us is always on the outs. In my teenage years, this was largely me, due to being born with a shiny platinum spine, zero tolerance for bullshit, and no filter. Its also commonly acknowledged that my brother is her favorite. This claim can be backed by, instead of making sure my sister and I had the braces we desperately needed, she paid for his divorce and his half-assed attempt to get custody of his daughter, which failed spectacularly. Since the custody attempt, he hasn't seen his daughter for more than a week total, in 15 years. Instead of setting aside money for us to go to college, she spent 30,000 over the course of 10 years bailing my brother out of situation after situation. When my dad flat out told her that she needed to choose between my brother's fuckery and her daughters, she got pissed, packed us up in my senior year of high school, and left my dad for a year. My dad, loving his kids and his wife, eventually talked her into coming home. I feel he should be nominated for sainthood.I t would be prudent of me to note that my mother is very money driven. Though shes got no problem with spending hers on ridiculous shit, she absolutely insists on her cut when its perceived that she's owed something. Case in point: At 15, I had a job, and had to pay her gas money to pick me up three nights a week from my after school job that was a mile from my parent's house. This was in the early 2000's, and I was paying her minimum 40$ a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I left home at 18, joined the military, and deuced the fuck out for four years. My sister, however, stayed in our hometown. She got married at 18 (largely, I think, to get the hell away from my now-becoming-more-obvious-in-her-controlling-nature mom). She got pregnant almost immediately, and due to complications with her pregnancy, and my niece was born 8 weeks premature. I was deployed at the time, so I got frantic emails keeping me abreast of the situation while managing to simultaneously berate me for bailing on my family, even though I'd already be enlisted for almost 2 years at this point, wasn't in the country, and couldn't go home on leave if I sold a kidney.

&amp;#x200B;

But this isn't about me. My niece ended up being just fine after cooking a bit longer in NICU, and my sister went on with her marriage. I came home from the military after being guilted into it by Soul Destroyer, because ""you know that we love you and miss you. Your dad isn't doing so good health-wise. He just wants his kids around him for as long as he's got left."" 8 years later, my dad is still kickin' and doin' it better than most people half his age. I got married, moved over an hour away, started college, and I'm basically living my best life. My brother fucked me over in a HUGE way last year, so I and my sister currently aren't talking to him, though my mom ""just wishes you three could get along."" Never mind the fact that whichever kid shes on the outs with at any given time is relentlessly put down and talked shit about behind their backs, to anyone who will listen. She's a real peach.

&amp;#x200B;

 Fast forward to this past November. Turns out, my BiL had been cheating, and told my sister that he wanted a divorce. After a decade of marriage, putting him through school, and a now 9 year old, naturally she was devastated. However, I was not the only one born with a sparkly spine, so she told him to gtfo and that he could send her the papers. She also, after having 5 back surgeries, including 2 fusions, has continued to work every day. Even so, she was struggling to make ends meet. Sister also decided that she was too young to give up on relationships altogether, so she has recently gotten back to dating. This is important later, I promise.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where Soul Destroyer comes in. Last month, she and my dad convinced my sister to give up her rental and move back home to save money. Even with a strong work ethic, my sister doesn't have a college degree and as a result, doesn't make a lotta cake at her job. Soul Destroyer and my dad told her that she and my niece could live in the fully finished basement, as it's basically an apartment, didn't have to worry about paying rent, ""just worry about getting back on your feet."" I'm sure you're all rolling your eyes and know what's coming right?

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after moving in, the harbinger of the death of hopes and dreams starts in on my sister. The basement ""apartment"" isn't up to her cleanliness standards, she doesn't like my sister's dog, claims he poops in the house (he doesn't), and that my sister needs to spend more time with ""the family"" upstairs. Note that the only people living in the house are my sister, her kid and my parents. Anyway, after a couple of weeks, my sister's bull-shit capacity was reached, and she got into it with my mother. Soul Destroyer was pissed that my sister hadn't gone to work that day, and was instead taking my niece to doctors appointments that ""your dad could have taken her! You need to work so you can get your life in order!"" At this point in the conversation, she also demands that my sis start paying 150$ a week in rent, 200$ on the weeks when my niece is in the house and not at her dads. My mother then tells sis that if she wasn't being such a whore, and fucking anyone that would pay her attention, that she would be a better parent and not being living off the charity of my parents. She also told my sister that she is an abusive parent. While I admit that my sister is stern and strict with my niece, she kind of has to be due to my niece being just like us two, having a mouth and plenty of sass. However, she is not abusive in anyway, shape or form. At this point my mom started throwing shit and told my sister to get out, to go live in a womens shelter ""or one of the men that youre fucking can pay for you."" Side note: in 4 months, my sister has slept with 3 people. While some may judge her for that, shes not dating around my niece or bringing random dudes around, and it's noones place to judge.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets good though. See, before my dad, my mom had been married twice before. She married 1, met 2, got divorced. Married 2, met my dad (3), got divorced, married dad. Each marriage has been better than the one before, in terms of jobs, homes, cars and retirement plans.  It's not a state secret. So, after all of this is slung at my awesome sister, she looks birth giver right in the eye and says ""Yeah, I'm strict with the kid. Yeah, I'm having trouble getting back on my feet. Yeah I'm dating. But I've also never used the men in my life as a ladder to climb to a higher income bracket. I've never slut-shamed someone I claim to love (this is something she did to me regularly before I got married). I've never treated the people who have been there for me through thick and thin like shit like you do to me and MountainDewandSmokes, while thinking the sun shines out of brother's asshole, no matter how he screws up. I really hope your tantrum was worth it. Im taking the kid and going to my sisters. I'll be by this weekend to pack my shit.""

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, my mother was the perfect mix of CBF, rage, and confusion. My sister was never one to really fight back, so I think she was shocked that she very flatly laid birth giver out like that. She apparently recovered, started throwing glass jars of shit, packed her own stuff when my dad refused to take sides, and went to my aunts house. When she doesn't get her way, she runs away until he caves. Oh well. After 30 years, he knows what hes getting into.

&amp;#x200B;

 She came to my house, and last week moved into her own place. Soul Destroyer has called looking numerous times looking for her, and when I refused to give info or become her flying monkey, I was a betrayer and am now persona non grata. Not that I give that first fuck. She currently has her neighbor and best friend trying to message my niece because ""you know grandmommy loves you right? You know your mom is just using you to get to me right?"" She's been blocked in every way known to man from us all, and last I heard, my bum brother just moved him, his woman, and his kid into my parent's house. He hasn't held a job since Bush was in office, so I doubt he'll be leaving anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long rant, I just thought I would share the awesomeness of my sister."
323,"Hey y’all! 

Of course the Monster in law is up to her MiL shenanigans, what else is new? I’ll tell you! I finally called her out on her shit in the moment. 🥳🥳 This woman is always talking about family and making memories with each other and being together and acting like time is better then money. I couldn’t have been more wrong when believing this BS, stupid me. 

Last Christmas I had my friend make a custom Christmas ornament with “baby SO last name est 2019”. I know you’re probably wondering why and I often ask myself that but it’s who I am. I’m always trying to fix things, people and relationships, it’s who I am to my core and I’m ok with that for the most part. But anyways, she cried and seemed to love it and made a post on the book of faces about it and put it on display front and center of the tree. So this year I purchased a Cricut and desired to make my own ornaments for the grandparents because I thought it was something they would love because it’s a custom ornament for her first Christmas and I made it personally for said grandparent. I made MiLs first because I wanted to do a test one first, you know just in case. I honestly worked hard on it and I think it actually turned out great (for those who don’t know, cutting the vinyl and putting it on things that arnt flat is pretty tough). Excited I send a picture in group text and fSiL says it’s cute and sends hearts, nothing from MiL and SO said I did an amazing job and it looks so great (god I love this man). 

I don’t think anything of her not replying because she’s been so busy with her divorce and court sometimes I don’t hear from her in days and I don’t care much if she messages me. I live in Canada and we have thanksgiving in October so of course we go over there for thanksgiving dinner (separate from my family, I rather the 2 didn’t mix) while we were sitting and eating it gets brought up. I mentioned that I had forgot it but I’ll bring it next time we come over and she straight up says she wanted a more expensive and better one and that in her family they like more extravagant things. 😳 without skipping a beat I gave her a dirty look and told her that what she said was extremely rude and I genuinely worked hard on that ornament for her. My fSiL actually backed me up and said it was very rude to make that comment, MiL looked mortified that A) I called her out and B) her daughter backed me. After we left we didn’t talk for days, then I get a text of this BS apology basically saying that she’s sorry she let her kids see how she treats me and that I should let her do things her way and how we always seem to butt heads because we both do things different but both have strong personalities. I haven’t replied and don’t intend to anytime soon, I need to think how I’m going to address this “apology” so there is clear communication that she will understand. I.E I’ve never been about cost of things or buying love and I don’t understand it but if that’s how she is then so be it but I will NEVER be that way and I will not accommodate that in my life. 

I will never understand this woman, says one thing but means another. Fuck it though, I’m just going to continue to stand my ground and call her out 

Thanks for reading this far! I love this group, makes me feel less alone in this MiL battle"
324,"Hey everyone. It has been a while! I’m currently 36 weeks pregnant, exhausted and soooooo ready to not be pregnant anymore lol I wanted to update you all and just needed to share this insanity with you. A lot has happened. This will be very long, apologies in advance for length and if it’s all over the place, I’m way too pregnant to function at 100% right now lol

Anyway, IGG was originally set to host my shower on X Date when I would be around 33-34 weeks pregnant. 2 months before IGGs planned shower date, I advised her that per the request of my OB, the shower needed to be rescheduled sooner. The reason being we live a few hours away in the mountains and my OB didn’t want me to travel that far after 30 weeks. Doing so could possibly cause issues (significant elevation changes, stress on my body/the baby, preterm labor, etc) IGG was unable to host it any sooner so my family said they would instead. IGG was *just so heartbroken* that she “wouldn’t be hosting the shower anymore but completely understood! And of course the health of the baby was most important, blah blah blah.” I should’ve known then she was planning some fuckery. 

My family scrambled together last minute and threw me a lovely baby shower right at 29.5 weeks. It was a chill backyard bbq with burgers and beers. Just a very relaxed co-ed hang out with mine and my DH’s friends and our immediate families. Totally our style and vibe. Not overly fancy/expensive/excessive, you get it. IGG and FIL were in attendance and seemed to enjoy themselves while there. 

Bonus burn #1: IGG brought champagne and orange juice and set up about 12 “premade” mimosas on the kitchen counter.....which no one drank because 1) my family doesn’t drink at all, except for me but 2) I can’t drink right now, obviously lol 3) many of the other guests were my girlfriends who brought their toddlers and weren’t going to be drinking then driving and 4) all the men in attendance were out back around the grill drinking beer....so IGGs gesture was a huge fail and she pouted/CBF’d the whole time while chugging mimosas alone hahaha it was great. 

After the shower ended, IGG tried to get us to load some of our gifts in her car because she assumed they wouldn’t all fit in our midsize SUV...No, thank you, they all fit fine 🖕🏼 I wasn’t putting *anything* in IGGs car. She then insisted that we park inside her garage for the night (we stayed at the IL’s house during our trip, unfortunately) because our car was full of gifts and would be a “sitting duck” for thieves. We did park in their garage and I triple checked our car was locked in case someone got sticky fingers. Little did we know, a month later she would be the biggest thief of all. 

Now onto the meat: IGG’s baby shower and her thievery! This happened a month after the shower my family threw for me, nearly the exact same weekend IGG planned to host my original shower if it didn’t need to be moved. IGG called it her “grandma shower” (which apparently are a real thing?!) but the invitations (fucking formal invitations!!) all said “baby shower” and you wouldn’t know the difference if you’d attended that this was a party meant to celebrate IGG becoming a grandma. Oh, no. There were socks/booties/beanies strung across walls, baby shoes, blue themed everything, baby’s breath flowers stuffed in vases as center pieces with toy cars strewn across the tables.....The. Whole. Fucking. Nine. It was a damn baby shower, plain and simple. *For her.* 🤢

The kicker? We didn’t know anything about it, or that this was planned, or had even happened until IGG texted us several days later “Please know how much Baby Name is loved” and then sent us photos of her opening gifts and beaming while holding up little onesies like some *pseudo expectant mother.* IGG also posted photos of her “shower” to her namesake where she captioned something like “thank you for helping celebrate my son, DIL and soon to be grand baby.” Upon viewing her photos, I saw an image of her invites where she used our names and OUR BABY REGISTRY.....but we were never included in, or notified of, this bullshit at all. 

It was absolutely sickening. I’m honestly surprised she didn’t wear a fake pregnancy belly to really live the experience!! I wish I could show you all the photos without risk of being identified. IGGs friend actually hosted it and IGGs “tribe” of other narcissistic old bitties actually went to, and supported, this craziness. I have no words. Just....WTAF, you guys. 

A week later IGG brought gifts from her “grandma shower” to us, because like I mentioned, I’m not able to travel. If you remember my last post about IGG coming here, this visit was at least planned AND she brought along poor eFIL as her meat shield to protect her from her evil DIL and disrespectful son. As soon as IGG walked into our home, she stuffed her hands in her pockets and CBF’ed while glaring at everything. On the flip side, this was eFIL’s first time seeing our place since we moved here a year ago, and he commented on how much nicer and bigger it was than our previous home, and was genuinely happy for us and our situation. 

While they were here we showed them the crib in our bedroom and eFIL touched it and ran his hands along it and pulled on the railing, just checking it out and testing stability while grinning at us with pride and obvious excitement imagining his grandchild in it. Meanwhile, IGG stood a foot away, refused to touch it and sneered at it.....all because MY mother purchased it for us. IGG also commented on wanting to see the massive amount of diapers my mother purchased for us (about 800 lol...my mom is insane, but in a good way haha) because IGG just couldn’t believe my mom actually bought that many....🤔 ooookay....lol 

IGG then demanded we open the gifts she brought for us (yeah, the ones IGG *already opened* at her baby shower...) and I immediately noticed SEVERAL items that were purchased off our registry mysteriously missing. Like the fucking BASSINET. Along with a bumbo seat, an activity play center, and a bouncer. You know what gifts IGG brought up for us? Clothes. Just clothes. IGG kept everything else. Oh, but she left a bag with grandma specific gifts (like a coffee mug and candle) in with the rest of the gifts she brought us.  IGG obviously didn’t care about the grandma gifts, it was never about her being a grandma. She sifted through everything and took what she wanted for her weird fucking nursery 3 hours away. 

Knowing she kept things, I looked at IGG and asked, “Oh, where’s the bassinet?? I saw it was marked as purchased on our registry, is it being shipped to us?” 

Cue deer in headlights (yeah bitch, you’re caught) “Oh, um, oh, well, they messed up and shipped it to me so I kept that for MY house...” trails off...

Me “....Why? It has a max weight of 15lbs, which Baby will reach by about 4 months...And if they start rolling over or pushing themselves up sooner you’re supposed to stop using it for safety reasons.....We cant visit “area you live” until the spring when Baby is just about 4 months old because it’s going to snow for months after Baby is born.....We were really looking forward to using that here...” *stares at her* 

IGG “Well...I just....I wanted to keep somewhere for the baby to sleep when you visited!” 

Me “The bassinet folds up and is portable, we would’ve brought it with us....we also have a travel pack n play that we planned to bring when we visit.....I receive email notifications when something on my registry is purchased (I don’t actually lol) I was really excited when I saw someone bought it for us....” *continue to stare at her intensely* 

IGG realizing I know she kept more than the bassinet “....I also have the bumbo seat....which....all my girlfriends like, made a really big deal about! And said it was an awesome item! So, I kept it for Baby to have a place to sit at my house....” 

Me “.....that also has a weight/use limit because they can injure themselves tipping over....” 

IGG *panic setting in* *wailing* “I just wanted to have things at my house to make things easier for you when you visit!” (...riiiiiiight) 

Me “You should’ve asked me, or bought your own, instead of just keeping ours.” 

IGG *hangs head* *pouts* “So I have to wait 4 months to meet my grand baby?!” 

Me “What? *sigh* No, IGG, that’s not what I said at all. You are welcome to come here and visit us. Baby is due in November and WE are not traveling to YOU until at least March. Anything you kept at your house won’t be used until March, or won’t even be used at all, if Baby is too big for it by the time we’re able to come down there.” 

IGG *sniffles and cbfs* 

This whole time, FIL and DH are awkwardly standing there watching the exchange go down, clearing their throats and shifting weight from foot to foot. We all go to dinner after that fiasco and IGG drops the bomb that she wants to be called as soon as my my water breaks and “be there” when Baby is born (hahahahahaha, nope) She’ll even pick up my mom and drive her up too (nice bribe, not gonna work) and IGG said wants to “help for the first 24-48 hours.” AKA: hog the baby fresh out of my womb since Baby won’t need The Incubator (me) anymore, IGG is here to take care of him! I just smiled and nodded “of course we’ll tell you.” 

IGG and FIL uneventfully left from the restaurant and DH and I went home. I’ve never been more glad they live hours away. And now I have even more clothes to wash, fold, sort and put away mere weeks before giving birth when I’d already done this a month ago after *my* baby shower.  Ugh. 

Bonus burn #2: IGG later texted us she would bring the bassinet when we notified her I was in labor. I told her no need, my mom already ordered another one and had it shipped to us. It’s in our living room now 😁 

Up next, the inevitable birth story. Can’t wait to share that with you all. Don’t worry, the hospital is aware of my “situation” and my visitors policy, which 10000% absolutely will include a password that only I know. DH can’t be trusted with it in case IGG forces it out of him in a moment of weakness. Wish us luck. 4 weeks (or less I hope, get this baby out of me lol) until shit really hits the fan!"
325,"TW: homophobia mention

hey y'all, I've read this forum often, just now posted, etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

my SO and I got engaged this spring (which I'm very excited about!) and its been a trip ever since. we've been dating since high school and I am a senior in college this year, so I've known about FMIL antics for a while now.

shes always been overbearing and has always had a quarrel with me, particularly because I'm bisexual and SO's family is very religious and finds this to be a terrible sin. she also doesn't like me because she often feels I stole away her son. shes simmered down in her terribleness since then, and I tend to just avoid contact with her since I'm at school anyway so it's worked out for quite a while.

the problems began around July this summer when I started getting ready for the wedding, which we've planned for October 2020. I went dress shopping, and only my mom and three of my close friends were invited to come with. I muted my phone during this since it was a big deal for me to find the perfect dress, which I did find and got then and there because it was instant love and I felt really comfortable in it (I struggle a lot with my body image).

after we left, I checked my phone to see 20 million messages. my SO mentioned to my FMIL that I was dress shopping, and she sent me giant paragraphs not to waste my money, why wasn't she invited, etc. I responded along the lines of she was rather far away (which is true, I live about 4 hours from FMIL) and I just wanted a small group to find the perfect dress. FMIL just responded I had a surprise for you.

immediately I knew this probably wasn't going to end well, but I went through with being nice and told FMIL she could show me next week when SO and I were heading down. the next week, she was super giddy and excited and dragged me into her bedroom to show me HER wedding dress, and just said ""Well, what do you think?""

this dress is the epitome of poofy princess sleeve, can't-hardly-breathe-corset level of princess, which is basically the complete opposite of the dress I got and not particularly my style. I told her it was a lovely dress, but I had already gotten mine and was rather happy with it. she continued to pester until I tried on the dress, simply stating she wanted to see me try it. I did thinking it'd appease her, looked like a whale drowning in it, and promptly left with SO. I thought it would be whatever and didn't hear much for the next while.

about a week ago, SO got a message from her asking to reconfirm my waist size. when he told me this, I was of course rather annoyed and told FMIL that I was not going to be wearing that dress, I already had my OWN dress of which I had already sent to be tailored and was really happy with. she never responded to me, I figure she's annoyed but will live.

couple days later and I get a call from FSIL, tells me how she really didn't think I handled things maturely. I was obviously really confused and asked her to elaborate, and she tells me how FMIL is running around saying I yelled at her, called her wedding dress ugly, ruined it in some furious rage of brattiness, and that I was going to ruin the family by marrying her son. SO has attempted to talk to her about this over the phone, but she always changes the subject and won't answer about what she's been saying about me.

my SO thinks I should just wear the dress to appease her, and that it's easiest to just do since he doesn't think she'll give up on this one. I really don't think its bratty of me to want to wear the dress I chose, and that I want to feel pretty on my wedding. I've let her bully me into a lot and I really don't want to change my stance on this.

UPDATE: I sent a message to FMIL saying how I didn’t appreciate her lying about me and how I was stern in not wearing the dress, and if she felt that upset by it she was by no means required to attend the wedding. She hasn’t responded, but if she continues to harass me I’ll likely just block her number. I told SO how I thought it was shitty he didn’t have my side, he apologized and agreed to talk to me tonight about it when he got home

thanks for the advice, I’m glad I wasn’t being crazy about this upsetting me"
326,"This is my first post. I am shaking I am so mad. I’m on mobile so sorry if formatting isn’t correct. 

My husband and I have been together for 9 years and married for 6. We have an 18 month old boy and a little girl due in December. 

His mom (who I have no nice things to say about right now) owns two reception centers and my husband basically runs them. A few years back there were three main people working for her: Employee 1 who did the hosting, appointments, planning sessions and showings etc, My husbands brother who did the yards and general maintenance for the buildings and my husband who did all the catering and food. Over the years they both quit, and their job duties were put on my husband with a very small increase in pay. She also had a boutique that he would have to go to before/after working the reception centers and work there. He worked long hours basically running the two centers. We’ve taken maybe 4 vacations together over the past 6 years because she can’t function without him. Even our honeymoon had to be shortened because their was a wedding that weekend he needed to work. 

Back in 2017 they got into a huge fight. She basically said he didn’t really do that much and he definitely wasn’t doing the work of three people. He quit on the spot. He was done. He called me and told me cause I was out of town for the weekend and I just told him we would figure it out and make it work. We were no contact for quite a few months. He ended up taking a job at a car dealership making a ton more money. His bonus checks alone covered our mortgage payment so we had plenty of extra money for savings and spending which we did not have when he worked for her. July of 2018 she contacted him about coming back and working for her. She had made a poor investment in a house and lost a six figure earnest money deposit. The girl she had running the centers was dumb as a rock. She would double book weddings and his mom would have to refund one of the weddings and switch them to a different day. She would discount food and whatnot to well below cost so they weren’t making any money at all. His mom was struggling to make ends meet. 

He agreed to go back after she made a few conditions:
1) beginning of the year he would get a raise (he was taking a significant pay cut to go back)
2) he would have a work truck/catering vehicle which would allow us to get rid of one our car payments to help with the pay cut
3) she would pay the difference of what it cost to add him to my insurance (about 250 a month)
4) he would get a percentage of the weddings he booked and planned as part of a bonus at the end of the year 
5) he would be doing food only and she would keep the yard guy on and the girl would transition to just hosting and showings. 

Well it’s now over a year later and the only one she’s somewhat followed through on is the insurance and it’s not the full amount. The girl ended up quitting, she let the yard guy go, so he’s back to doing everything. 

Now. Tuesday night my husband went to play basketball with some of his old neighbors. He ended up coming home pretty early and I noticed he was limping. He said one of the guys dove to try and get the ball from him and ended up hitting his knee. I asked if we needed to go to the er and he wanted to wait til morning and make an appointment. I took him to the doctor the next morning and it turns out he tore his ACL and MCL. The doctor was extremely surprised that he was even walking (it was more of a pathetic hobble). He’s supposed to be non weight bearing on crutches until his mri today. He called his mom when we were leaving the doctor giving her an update and she was extremely annoyed saying how there was a wedding this weekend blah blah blah. He was extremely upset after the phone call and cried because he felt like he was letting everyone down. He was worried about surgery and not being able to carry his new daughter when she comes. 

Thursday he went into work to mow the lawn and move the tables for the wedding Saturday. Friday he went into finish mowing, cause he was in too much pain. Today he told me he was going in to decorate the cake (which I get, I wouldn’t want his mom touching my wedding cake) and said he’d be home after and then go to his mri. I got a text from him that said “can you send me the paper for the mri? I need to cancel it.”

He met his mom at Sams club and she was apparently crying in the produce for whatever fucking reason saying how she didn’t know how she was going to do it today. 

So he’s working the whole wedding. A sandwich buffet. Really? Your mom can’t handle making sandwiches and putting them out? I told him I’d find a babysitter and go work the wedding cause this is ridiculous. There is no reason she can’t handle a wedding for 30 people without him. 

She is so manipulative. She freaked out full well knowing that my husband would step up and do it for her because this isn’t the first time she’s pulled something like this. I couldn’t tell you the last time he was able to use a sick day. The way I see it is she needs to be a mom first and then a business owner. And to be honest I’m at the point where if she’s not going to care about her son and his well being then she shouldn’t have the privilege of seeing her grandkids. 

So I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or someone to validate my crazy pregnancy feelings. I’m just so angry that she takes advantage of him as much as she does. I’ve talked to him about other jobs. That we (my, son and future daughter) are his family and we need to come first and he needs to stop trying to save her businesses. She’s running them into the ground with poor decisions and then blames my husband when they aren’t racking in the money. He’s just the type of person who tries to take care of everyone and I know he’d feel guilty if he left her high and dry."
327,"title says it all. i’ve had issues with my MIL for years now, and it’s only gotten worse since my pregnancy. honestly i have so many stories, but i’ll focus on the most recent and the one mentioned above. when i was in labor, she texted and asked me not to post any pictures until my SO could get there (he works in canada until november and missed her birth by a day). she then posted the pictures i had sent her before i could post anything and didn’t ask beforehand. she’s also implied i cheated and DD is not SO’s (she is, unless i’m somehow the new Virgin Mary). 

onto the story. SO is canadian and currently working in British Columbia. MIL lives in Ontario, I live in the middle of the Midwest. when SO is finished with his job, he will come live with me and DD during the offseason while i finish school. we were facetiming the other night and he casually mentioned that MIL wanted him to bring DD to canada for the whole month of December. oh, and i’m not invited. this means not only would my EBF and incredibly attached baby be away from her mother, i would also miss her first Christmas and New Years. MIL sees nothing wrong with that and thinks i’d be selfish to disagree (she also thinks i’m incredibly selfish for finishing my last year of school). i laughed out loud when i heard this, because over my dead body. 

i’m not sure where to go from here, because it’s only getting worse. i’d love some advice on setting boundaries or keeping her away from my baby, because she’s also incredibly manipulative and is not an influence i would ever want around my child. she’s also been known to take my SIL’s baby out of her arms/refuse to give him back when asked."
328,"So I posted pre party at my JNMIL house. I couldn’t justify spending an arm and a leg on a carrier to wear my baby so I went without one 

Before we went I decided to send them a text stating only myself my SO and MIL and SIL would be allowed to hold DD as long as they weren’t smoking or having just smoked and if MIL was drinking she had to be sitting when holding my daughter no exceptions

The response? Two thumbs up emojis. Now not a complete acknowledgement and agreement but whatever

I conceded to let them hold her because I honestly didn’t want the fight but also it’s her party so I knew they’d be too busy to hold my baby lol

Turns out, I was right! It went great. Found out my SIL is having another girl so that was fun nobody tried to take my baby but FIL and seeing as his kids wanted nothing to do with him I let him hold my baby for like an hour before we left which he was super happy about. 

That was an update to my last post now on to the new shit

My mother is very just maybe. She sways from serious no territory to very yes. So needless to say we have a strained but decent relationship. Her thing is she’s a new grandma and is easily excited and tends to want to be proud and show off my baby but doesn’t really have anyone to show off to lol

To start my family doesn’t have an issue with vaccines or anything my mom got her shots so she can snuggle baby all holiday season long. Okay cool no biggie. 

But this woman knows I hate a select few members of my dads side of the family. And this backstory is necessary for this story so please don’t take this down!

*my grandparents on my dads side died 7 weeks apart right before my 16th birthday many moons ago. My father was the only kid that went down to be with my nana before she died and therefore was the one who had to deal with both of his parents dying and taking care of their funeral and the properties they owned etc. his brother and sister (all of them were adopted because my nana couldn’t have kids) only showed up to go through the jewelry that was left behind upon my grandparents deaths. Like the fucking vultures they are. Upon leaving my dads sister decided to visit the shelf where we placed their ashes (cremated and in the same box together) and had the balls to say “oh Mom and dad you’ve become a catch-all!” Aka a junk shelf. I saw red haven’t spoken to her since not even at my sisters wedding a few years ago. She was and is the worst person I’ve ever met she’s selfish rude and just so many other horrid things*

Now my mom HAD to get me and DD and SO to come over tomorrow to have family meet DD. No problem. I was told it was my aunt (one of my moms sisters) my grandma and my god parents (my dads brother and his wife) as well as my sister and her hubs. No biggie right? WRONG.

THIS WOMAN INVITED SOMEONE I HATE AKA MY FATHERS SISTER. I feel betrayed by my mother. She knows if I had known before I wouldn’t have agreed. I’m in a spot where I can’t back out because my god parents as horrible as they used to be, have actually gotten better now that they child is an adult in college and my sister and I are full functioning adults. So I don’t want to punish them. They’ve been super patient about meeting DD and deserve it. My aunt and grandma too. It’s just that the woman who I want zero to do with is being blessed with not only my presence but my SO and baby’s presence as well. 

I’m easily going to be the most miserable person there tomorrow and my SO is aware as well as my sister who’s trying to chill me out because that woman literally has zero boundaries and zero fucks to be given about how anyone but herself feels. So I know she will snatch my baby from whoever has her when she shows up. 

I already anticipate getting there and stating pass the baby will not be tolerated. My god mother and my mother will be who I allow to hold the baby seeing as my other aunt and grandma have held her each one time previously. I am basically barring my god father my fathers sister and her son from holding my child (and my sister and her hubs and my father but they don’t tend to want to hold her really lol)

I feel like I’m being an asshole but I’m trying to be fair and also take care of my baby. Idk how to appropriately tell my mother that she’s fucked up in inviting my fathers sister over as well as not telling me about it without flat out saying “hey bitch you fucked up go fuck yourself” because that’s exactly what I want to say. I also don’t know how I’m going to handle that thing trying to touch me or my child without hitting her or being outright nasty. 

I’m in a spot I never thought I’d be in and I need some support and advice to keep me from spiraling /:"
329,"Back again, on mobile all that wonderful format that does not work..you get the idea.

This bitch! My stepmil - thought she would not only 1) exclude me from the entire family holidays, 2) exclude my children, nephew and adopted kid 3) tell me that she was just going to take SD when she wanted

Ha ha ha ha ha- NO.

So I get the call today from Aunt who I guess would be the Matriarch of the family (DH side all irish) her first words are ""now sweetie dont be mad I handled it"" - that's when you know it's going to be good.

She informs me first that me, DH, and all of our children are family and we will be welcome to Thanksgiving and Christmas events. That no one will be acting out or they will leave.

Confused I ask what happened. In the course of the last few days since I sent a message asking what could I bring (5 teens, 3 are athletic boys who eat like crazy) stepmil has done the following:
1) claimed me and my children (to include my daughter, son, nephew and the sweet trans teen I adopted who got thrown out) were really not family and had no right to be invited to holiday events..only my DH and stepdaughter. 
2) claimed she was just going to show up and take my stepdaughter (14f) and just have her own holiday and go shopping just for her as the ""others"" didn't matter

The best one

3) that I would be dangerous....that because I am a combat veteran i should be locked up in a psych ward.

The entire family responded- fuck off-

Yep. They all told her that she was only married in, just like me. That in the (DH last name) family they do not tolerate that kind of malarkey. That they are a military/police/ government types family and are so proud that I served. That all of my and DH children were seen as family no matter where they came from and it's a package deal. She was told her and her horrible bitch daughters can fuck off an they will revisit them attending maybe Easter if they learn there manners.

I had to laugh...oh yes I was pissed. This bitch will not interrupt my holidays.

But she doesn't stop there she made the mistake of sending the same shit to my DH...who calmly went into the garage and unleashed hell.

She made a bigger mistake by trying to bring my stepdaughter in and texting her the same shit. I have only seen my DH that angry when Fee fee FELICIA- tried to get in the house. Silent fury which he called the lawyer and another round of cease and desist for them with a big green bow I think.

My stepdaughter came home gave me a hug and asked me and her father to block her stepgrandmother and aunts.

She said she will not be around someone who would talk so badly about her sister and brothers and especially me..all the sephora and ulta  stepgrandma wanted to buy she can keep it not worth it.

So now another set of family (step mil and DH two sisters yes they backed their mom up and said some stuff as well but that's for justno family) we are no contact with.

So I'm just sitting here, being an angel and letting the bitch hang herself with Christmas lights and tinsel as decorations. 

Deck the halls and cut out drama ..fa la la la.."
330,"(Long back story and an example of TC’s back stabbing) I have many.. many stories. I have shared a few in comments but figured I could maybe start sharing in posts. My DH and I have been together since high school. (We were 14 but I was a grade ahead of him.)  She was not the best mom and their history involves things that would likely get social services involved now-a-days, and before I met him she’d packed her bags and left to live with another man. His Dad (not biological but the man who took him in and loved him like a son) is the parent I knew for the first while. 

When DH finally accepted talking to her again (after she just up and left) she invited us up to see her (and her new man). She said things like ‘You’re the daughter I never had!’ and such. For years I thought we had a pretty descent relationship and that things would be pretty good. DH and I dated through high school and both our parents (my mom&amp;dad and his dad) got anxty about us dating for so long, making suggestions like we find someone else. His dad turned into a JNF (JYFiL in the future) for a few years but TC kept things pleasant and made her place a place of refuge where we could be together. Turns out she was using accepting me/being nice to me as a means to try to get her son in her life more. She figured out by being nice to me and asking me to visit she’d get more access to her son. I had no idea the level of crazy/manipulation she was already wielding.

My first year of university my DH was in grade 12. We didn’t see much of each other, we’d been together about 5 years by this point, but his (at the time) JNF had pressured him so much (calling me a princess and bad mouthing me and such) that he decided to break up with me. I was in mourning and couldn’t eat for a week. TC continued to be nice to me (we chatted on MSN at the time) and invited me up to Thanksgiving at her place (about a month after the break-up)-promised DH wouldn’ be there but I figured out by then that it was likely BS and I could expect him there. (Ultimately we talked after TC went to bed and decided to get back together but keep it a secret from everyone-which lasted a year or so.)

A few months go by, he’s still in school and I’m still in Uni but we talk online all the time and we get cell phones and start texting (I got mine for safety walking in the big city-this was back before every teen had one before grade 9.) keeping everything a secret-even from our mutual friends. Everyone believes we’ve decided to just be friends so hanging out together with everyone is considered normal. Sometimes we’d sneak out to see each other in secret. When summer comes I decided to go live with my oldest sister (we’re 17/18 by this point) for July/Aug to spend time with her/her kids and get a summer job in her town (a flight or many bus trips away from home town). I stay in contact via MSN primarily with DH and friends. 

Guys, here’s where it really hit me that she was crazy. This whole time she had stayed in contact with me, being nice and offering advice and so on.. and while I was away living with my sister SHE WAS TELLING EVERYONE I HAD RUN OFF BECAUSE I’D GOTTEN PREGNANT WITH SOME OTHER MAN’S CHILD! DH and I were still only secretly together and no one knew we were dating, including her. What. The. Fuck? What possible motivation could she have for that? 
I’ll tell you: make her son feel bad and hate me so he ends up needing her and moving in with her and loving her for saving him. She almost always uses any excuse (made up or real) to put a rift between us so he’ll come running to her “oh mommy, she hurt me, thank you so much for saving me, you’re the best”. Sorry, lady. He knows far more worse things you’ve done over the years and every time you try to make me look bad you’re making it worse. 

Over the years DH and I went through periods of NC or VLC but that doesn’t stop her from inflicting her crazy on us. I’ve learned since that she tends to make shit up and will frequently play the victim card. Crazy Drama Queen to the core. 🙄😑 Sorry for the long post."
331,"Hi. It’s the MCAT my mom said I’ll never be a doctor girl. I aced my midterms (so far. One left.)  btw thanks y’all for encouraging me!! I’m gonna keep working! 

My mom has gradually gone down the rabbit hole to anti-vaxxism. She didn’t used to be this way. She used to be science minded until she got rejected from Med School. It was a slow undoing of her rational mind, until 2016. This latest shit show started when Tr*mp was elected. 

The problem I have today is the way she treats me about ME getting vaccinated. Me, a grown adult, getting vaccinated. I tend to get a tinsey tiny bit sick after vaccinations. Nothing more than a 12 hr fever and fatigue, which is normal. Rather get a little sick then fucking die of meningitis. 

However, she has to dramatize it. She acts like I’m dying (I’m not) and then proceeds to belittle me about my choices for vaccination. 

example 

Me: I can’t go out with you right now, I’m feeling really tired.  I want to chill for a bit. 

My Mother: ITS THOSE DAMN VACCINES THEY’RE KILLING YOU!!!!! YOU ARE A SHEEP!!!!!! 

I recently got my flu shot for this year a few weeks ago. I ended up a little more sick than normal (I think I was already sick and didn’t know it so my body freaked out on me). She flipped her shit and told me I was letting big pharma kill me. Let the record show that she stated this is one of the reasons I could never be a doctor because “I would let big pharma kill all my patients because I’m too stupid to know better”. 

I couldn’t catch a break (got strep, some stomach bug, and a minor cold) and of course my mother is contributing that to my flu shot and not the fact I work in an ER and sometimes you can pick things up even if you’re careful. 

Today was awful in that she would NOT STOP patronizing me. I’m so tired of it. I’m so tired of always being called dumb. She always insists I know nothing. I’m some dumb sheep in a propaganda machine that slaughters children with our “vaccines”.  Then she said the kicker: You are the way you are because I was stupid enough to vaccinate you. I’m sorry. 

WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN????? I JUST?????? WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING???? I’m so fucking tired of her bullshit oh my god.

I’ve had enough for a long time. I’ve been plotting my escape. I got an acceptance letter to another university (love my current one but this one is better and is 1500+ miles away from my mom), my job is transferable over there, and I’m almost at my preferred savings goal. I’m keeping it a secret so none of it backfired.

She has threatened that if I leave I can never come back and I’m internally like “GOOD!!!!” but it scares me because there goes my safety net. But I have to do what’s best for me and my future. I have to remind myself I’m not that 17/18 year old kid anymore. I have a job lined up, savings, and multiple back up plans. I have a goal and I can reach it. I guess I’m just scared of failure but I also can’t stand being treated like this anymore. Does that make me a brat?? Not wanting to be around my mother??? Idk I just need advice and encouragement to take the leap of faith."
332,"My MIL NEVER reaches out to come see her ONLY grandchild. She constantly complains that she “never sees him” and “misses him so much.” She texted my fiancé today saying “I know you guys have plans for Halloween but you should come over to our house because SIL and BIL are going to be here” If you want to know why I HATE being around this woman so much you can read some of my post history. I really do not want to go over. 1) I have plans with my sister, it my nieces first Halloween as well and we wanted the cousins to trick or treat together 2) my son gets CRANKY when we’re out late and is really uneasy around MIL 3) I HATE THE BITCH. I genuinely HATE being around her. She’s rude, condescending, manipulative and constantly plays the victim. She has never apologized for any of her wrongdoings let alone take responsibility for them. Am I wrong to not want to go over? I just think if she really wants to see her grandson on his first Halloween she needs to get off her ass and come see him. IM DONE making the effort and giving her what she wants. I can’t imagine this will go over well with fiancé..."

Feeling alone in motherhood

Motherhood is tough. With all the hormones and constant worries and anxieties on my mind. I find that if surrounding family and friends can be understanding towards the Mother and care for her feelings, it’s half the battle won.

My mil is naturally a little overbearing even before I gave birth. After I gave birth she has been offering to come every Friday after her work ends at 3:45pm to help out. I told her that I will let her know if I need her. 

Why I did not accept her help readily is because I am afraid she’ll be overbearing, I won’t have my personal space, and she’ll comment a lot on how the baby is taken care of and I wouldn’t be able to stand my ground. I don’t rly need much help as of now anyway because I don’t work in the day. 

She has been over to visit a few times, but as newborns are, they are sleeping all the time and she doesn’t have “enough time to talk to him”. 

So anyway she tells my Husband she is coming over today. We obliged but I told my Husband that if baby is tired, baby is tired. He will go to his room to nap. We have to be firm on this. 

I expected her visits (like all other visits to be a comfortable 1-2 hour visit).She came at 11:30am in the morning. Brought along some groceries and announced she will be cooking dinner here. I was shocked, thinking to myself “you’re planning to stay that Long?”

Anyway I didn’t wna make it ugly so I just let her. 

She proceeds to also tell me and my Husband to go out and leave her alone with the baby. I am totally not prepared for this and I was taken aback and immediately felt my protective instincts rise up and I politely told her there’s no need, I’ll be home taking care of LO. She keeps insisting but I don’t want to. 

Shortly after, she brought my helper out to grocery shop more and says she will teach my helper how to cook certain dishes later. All these she did without asking me or my husband, she just casually told us she will be doing it. When she was out with my helper, I told my Husband that i didn’t expect her visit to be so Long and that she’ll be doing so many things. I need my personal space and my rest. 

He didn’t find it a problem and told me that his mom is just trying to help. I told him I don’t mind help but only when it is really helpful to me, especially emotionally. He just responded that he is caught in the middle. I suggested why not gently let her know if she wants to stay so Long to help out next time round, give us a heads up beforehand, otherwise we may assume it’s just a normal short visit and we may have other plans. He doesn’t seem too keen on telling his mom this. 

Her help makes me feel burdened. I don’t rly think she rly has good intentions to help me, she just wants to feel good about herself. I do not feel like I need to teach my helper those few extra dishes, and they are not dishes that I particularly like as well. What would rly help me is e.g. coming to visit and asking about how I’m feeling and giving me my personal space. 

I proceeded to go into the bedroom where my LO is napping. And I broke down crying (not for the first time since 5 wks ago when he’s born). He came in about an hour later and find me crying to myself, and he basically tells me he’s not going to talk to his mother about this issue at all and I am the one that’s going to have to control my temperament and emotions. 

We’ve been quarreling abit due to him not understanding my heightened emotions now and Saying I am demanding or unreasonable when I nicely tell some visitors that it is not a convenient time. He thinks I’m too controlling and easily stressed out now by everything.

I honestly can’t help it and I know it’s the hormones but I feel so alone in this. I can’t help my feelings and I don’t wna be mean about it I’m always tryna put inconveniences across to people the nicest most polite way I can. And try to explain to them why it is not a good time to come etc.

He makes me feel like my feelings are invalid. So I’ve been crying a lot due to all these stresses. And it makes me feel like I can’t be a happy mother and a competent Mother. Sometimes I feel like I wna run away with the baby since I am alone in this anyway. Might as well truly be on my own, so I will not be bothered by others anymore. 

Because of this I’m second guessing myself so much. Thinking I may be really demanding. Unreasonable. Selfish. Controlling. All these things he said. 

I don’t wna sound ungrateful. But I’d be appreciative of help when it is needed and I can truly feel relieved by it. Sometimes I just feel like nobody in this family cares about what I am feeling. They just do whatever they want bcuz they think it’s what I need or it’s good for me. Or they just wna feel useful and good about themselves.

Update: she left as my husband told her she can leave once she’s done as I’ll be in my room resting. Do I need to text her to thank her for her “help” today or will that just enable her??

2nd update: thanks for the replies y’all. It’s truly heartening to be reminded that I need to stop second guessing myself and place my needs first! There’s no excuse bcuz I am a new mother in the 4th trimester and other pple who are not supportive are gonna have to deal."
334,"My JNMIL has difficulty with boundaries. We didn't have much contact at first, so I had no idea that this would be a problem. Cue first grandbaby, and boom, problems. JNMIL is weird about pregnant bellies, randomly kissed my stomach when I was only a few weeks pregnant with my first, no warning.

This is a story from my pregnancy with my second, after all the issues came out. I was probably around 7 months pregnant, and we were over their house. She desperately wanted to feel my daughter moving, but my daughter was sleeping at the time. I told her I'd let her know if my daughter started to move, otherwise please just wait for me to say ok. This is not a new discussion, she's well aware I don't want her touching my belly randomly.

Well, she didn't like that. She tried to catch me once, and I reminded her of the no-touch until permission rule. Then out of no where about 20 minutes later, she grabbed my belly so I couldn't back up quickly. Of course she didn't feel my daughter, still sleeping. It felt so violating. When I confronted her, she said ""it's my granddaughter, I have the RIGHT to feel her move."" So friggin pissed about it, almost a year later. Of course, she has no idea why I don't like her. She knows ""she's a loving wonderful nana,"" as she's told me."
335,"\*\*edited to fill in some blanks etc. Added to the end\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep this is brief as possible, but it's pretty complicated and there might be a lot of gaps to fill. It might also be all over the place, sorry.

My wife and I (early 40's) have been married for 6 years, together for 12, and we also dated in our mid-teens for a few years (our respective first relationships) and found each other again as adults. We are very good together, no major issues, it's a good marriage. Though we do come from different socio-economic backgrounds. Hers definitely blue-collar, low income; me, upper middle class. Never been an issue for us, we've both learned a lot from each other - but, the extended family dynamic is one that I never really was accepted by her immediate family, particularly her mother and her older brother.

She previously had 2 kids, who were in kindergarten and grade school when we first re-connected. Now one is post-high school and figuring things out, the other is in middle school. The older of the two has serious, serious abandonment and rejection issues, and did before I came along. Basically from toddler age onwards. His bio father skipped out pretty much after he was born. My wife made the best of it, raised him well on her own (and with her mother's help), and by the time I reconnected with her, and met him, he was a genuinely nice, polite, and pretty adorable young man. His step-brother came along when he was 4/5 years old, and was planned. That relationship soured immensely after he was born, and that marriage ended, so she was now back to raising 2 children (one on her own, the other shared custody, and still is).

My relationship with the two boys started off strong, and still very much is with the younger one. At some point in his mid-teens, the older one suddenly decided he hated me - not a huge shock, because teenager + step parent. It was expected, to be honest, in one way or another. We dealt with it as best we could (with a lot of love and empathy, as well as maintaining our roles as parents). It lasted longer than we both thought, however, and we only recently found out why, some 4 years after the rebellion started.

Long story short, he went to his grandmother (my wife's mother, my MIL). Someone he, and we obviously, trusted and loved.

We only recently found out what she did, however, and it's what caused the implosion of the family. She does not like me, and apparently never has (no particular reason imo, I'm a decent human being, not an asshole, etc. My wife has no real understanding of where the hatred comes from, either). So she took what our son/stepson said, and ran with it. ie. rather than helping him through a pretty typical teen/parent relationship, she took it as an opportunity to remove me from the equation. As much has been said by others who were on the periphery, so it's not my imagination or ego that's telling me this.

Over the span of about 3 years or so, she's been ""working"" him, as well as his girlfriend (of about 3 years, as well. She's great, too, and we adore her). Thankfully, his girlfriend questioned a lot of things over the years, brought things to our attention when she felt necessary, and went to her mother numerous times (also a wonderful person, in our eyes). It ultimately became his girlfriends mother who started to unravel things over the last few months, because she, as well as her daughter, were pretty much caught in the middle of it all.

The first thing she really, truly questioned, directly to my mother-in-law, was when she told HER mother (our son's girlfriend's grandmother!!!) that her daughter was only with me for my ""money"". The grandmother thought this was an odd, and inappropriate thing to say about her daughter, never mind to her in particular, so she brought it to the girlfriend's mom's attention. She then questioned the mother-in-law directly, got some lame apology, and that was that.

Literally the next week, our son's girlfriend started being cold to my wife out of the blue. Like I said, we absolutely adore her, and we're in regular touch with her, and even spend time with her by herself (she often asks what we're up to. Seriously, she's a keeper). Over the span of a few days, the way she talked to either of, messages and texts, was very cold, and clearly something wasn't right. I reached out to her mom to see if everything was okay, and it turned out that my wife's mother told the girlfriend that my wife had called her an asshole. Her advice to her 17 year old daughter was to take a couple of days to process it before she asks questions and/or overreacts, which she did. We all got to the bottom of it (it was a lie, obviously, and we were able to prove it beyond a doubt), and all was well again with our son's girlfriend.

That was, what we thought, the beginning of the end for what she was doing, but she decided to go all out and light fire to everything. She first backed off the kids for a couple of weeks, then announced she was depressed and on anti-depressants, and wasn't well, and had had a hospital visit, had a bad flu, blah blah blah.

Thing is, the kids (and girlfriend's mother) kept their distance from her during this time, but ALSO from us, even more so than before. We're still pretty much in the thick of that, which sucks. Things have become clear for everyone involved now - more was discovered once we all started comparing notes and \*actually\* talking about issues (among them, that my wife's mother is convinced I have her daughter under some sort of control, that she's told our son he should never talk to us again, and that she outlined her daughter, my wife's, past sexual and relationship history (with a LOT of lying I might add) to several people, INCLUDING our son's 17 year old girlfriend. There's more, too much to list, and equally as horrifying).

So here we are. The mother in law's insane manipulation and horrible gossip, and just all-around terrible behaviour has been outed to all involved. Yet she's not only still in their lives, but it seems as though all has been forgiven. We just had Canadian Thanksgiving, and she hosted at her place this year. No invite for us (not that we would have gone, anyway), but everybody else in the family did.

Basically, she somehow managed to ""win"", despite everything she said and did - most about her own daughter - coming out. My wife has no one now. For that side of her family, that kind of behaviour is not uncommon, it's just that she never saw her own mother turning on her like that. She lived through that sort of thing her whole life, but the shittiness was always directed towards other people, so she's always known her mother was capable of this. But not to her, and not to the extent it happened. Her father's side of the family is extremely small, and they are very much ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"". She and I have both tried to talk to her father about the very basics of what's been going on, but he will literally shut it down within seconds and change the subject. Of her two brothers, her oldest one followed right along with their mother, so forget him. The younger is a combination of happy-go-lucky and oblivious, so he's no help, either.

She has basically been abandoned by her immediate family at this point. And her own mother - who she, AND I - loved, figuratively stole her oldest son, my stepson, from her, and then set fire to her character to cover her tracks. It's insane when I think about it, and worse when I write it out.

Help? Advice?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\* extra details\*\*\*\*

\- we have NC with her, and haven't had any for several months now. The last thing she said to my wife, her daughter, was ""\*\*\*\* you and your husband"". This was in response to my wife sending her a very civilized message in regards to how she's treated her, me, and others. Our son, his girlfriend, her mother, and several others were shown this message, and were horrified. Yet they kept her in their lives.

\- we tried counselling with our son, but he balked every time. He's 19 now, and no longer lives under our roof, so there's not much we can do

\- our younger son (going on 14) is, well, going on 14. He's more interested in friends, video games and YouTube. MIL hasn't reached out to him (that we know of, and he says not) in god knows how long. He knows the gist of what's happened, but not the sordid details, just the basics. He's 13, after all. As he gets older, if this is still an issue, he will be told exactly what that woman did and said about his mother, and me. Right now, he's too young. We have made it a point to tell him that we are NOT keeping him from his grandmother or family, and we're not, in theory. Nobody has reached out to him anyway, but if certain people did, we'd make sure he was busy that day. But ultimately, if he ever insists on spending any time with them, we won't stop him - that'd only make things worse. He's surprisingly mature for this age, and is not happy about any of this to start with, and we'd make sure he knew what to look out for, or listen for.

\- we do have contact with the older son, but it's pretty minimal. He doesn't live here, he's 19 and figuring out life, and he still has the over all mental issues he's always been dealing with, which are largely directed at us, me in particular. He's a very negative thinker - always thinks the worst will happen, and did long before I came along. His bio father really did abandon him and his mother when he was an infant, and has basically done it again recently, after him getting in touch several years ago. He didn't do well in school, and it was always because the teachers didn't like him. He'd never try anything new for fear of failure. That sort of thing. He's still the same, and he needs to see someone in a huge way, and nobody but us have ever spoken to him about it, to the best of our knowledge. He's surrounded by people who either don't recognize his issues (and blame it on us, me, or other external sources) or people who say he'll figure it out on his own, in time. While most of those people do love and care about him, it's not a healthy environment."
336,"An update to a previous post. I finally deactivated my FB because just limiting her access to my profile/blocking didn't keep her from being able to passive aggressively mess with me throught her friends. We went to lunch at my ILs house and she and her friends just grilled me and judged  me all afternoon--why am I drinking a glass of wine with lunch? How am I feeding LO? How many times does she get to see grandma? Why am I still working? OMG ENOUGH! We left early and I shut it down that night.
On an unrelated note: I didn't realize how I compared myself to other mothers until the past 2 Fb-less days. I feel much better now haha"
337,"So, for some background, I have been will my DH since we were 14, and my MIL has always been narcissistic, controlling, and spiteful. For that reason, I was not very surprised when she seemed to have no interest in our wedding (almost exactly one year ago). 

She showed up when she had to, but otherwise did not offer to help at all. The only thing we asked of her was to not bring her shitty, abusive boyfriend. So at the wedding, she got absolutely hammered and hardly spoke to us. This was fine, and the wedding and reception were amazing and we had a great time.

That night in our hotel room, we decided to open our presents. We got to two boxes with no tags on them. As soon as we opened them, I knew it was JNMIL. They were old printer paper boxes filled to the brim with trash and junk. We were dumbfounded. The boxes were full of old bills, dirty socks, paper towels, old homework, and various cards and pictures. Hardly any of it was even DH's.

When DH finally confronted her weeks later, she was angry we did not thank her for the ""gift"" and insisted she thought she would like it. To this day, she gives us bags/boxes of assorted junk and trash and smirks and says ""I know how much you hate getting this stuff."" She drives me crazy."

The Baby Grabber(MIL) just sent this to my SO asking when my birthday was and why we didn't announce it to every one.

Like, HELLOOOO. I'd just had major abdominal surgery.

Why on earth would we go paintballing only 2 weeks after I had just ejected a whole human from my abdominal cavity?

Kinda wish we did cos I wanna shoot that witch so hard..."
339,"All my posts here before have been about my father-in-law's significant other. My husband's biological mother has always been a reasonable human being, except that she's *convinced* that we're going to have a third child because we don't have a daughter.

When I was pregnant with #2 and we didn't know the gender, she bought us baby girl clothes. When I asked her what we would do with them if we had a boy, she said we'd save them for our third child. When I reminded her that her son only wants to have two children, she told me I would ""just have to get myself pregnant."" Conceiving a third child against her son's will was okay, apparently, because ""you've already trapped him twice."" (Look, lady; it's not a 'trap' if he actively participated in the conception, k?)

When we knew that #2 was a boy and she was making plans to come visit after the birth, she mentioned that she was going to use it as an opportunity to convince her son to have a third child. I warned her not to because my husband's father had tried to convince him *not* to have a second child after our first was born, and my husband was completely fine not speaking to him for several months. I reminded her of this and told her not to try it. She replied that it would only be a *little* talk. 

When she was here visiting and she and I were alone she started talking about us having an ""accident,"" with the clear implication that I would be causing this accident deliberately. I told her bluntly that I'm getting an IUD, after which she switched over to talking about us having ""a real accident."" 

On a separate occasion, she mentioned that when we bought a house it would need four bedrooms ""for when you have an accident.""

On another separate occasion, she brought up how, when I get my own car, it should be a van ""for when you have an accident.""

When my husband drove her to the airport, she apparently spent the whole ride telling him that I am lying about being okay with having only two children and that I am desperate for a girl but am too dutiful a wife to tell him.

Apparently she hadn't realized that I was reporting each of these things back to him, starting with and including her instructions for me to ""stealth"" her own goddamn child (who by the way she should be *far* more loyal to than whatever random woman he's married and could divorce tomorrow, even if I *did* desperately want a third child.) But she's sure as shit aware of it now because she landed to a nice text from me in which I told her to leave her son the fuck alone about getting me fucking pregnant already. 

Jesus, can't I have any *sane* family?"
340,"So i recently moved out of my mothers house to live with my dad and i’m not sure how bad this is but heres a list of what my mother has done and still does she has, compared me to my drug addict brother constantly said i have replaced her with my girlfriend tells me to not look call my dad family cause it hurts her used to use the belt on me and my brothers and has blamed me for her depression and because she has lost weight we are all below her not sure this is bad if it isnt comment and  ill remove it"
341,"A little info to start; My wife's parents are piles of shit and have been in and out of prison for her entire life leaving her paternal grandmother to raise her and her siblings. Her sister had two wonderful daughters but was killed in a head on collision with an oil truck 7 years ago because she was texting and driving on the way to buy drugs mere minutes after (thankfully) dropping the girls off with a friend. Wife's grandmother is now the legal guardian of the two girls, our nieces. 



My wife had septoplasty on Wednesday, it is Friday as I type this, and her grandmother(JNGMIL) offered and comitted to come over our way (6 hour drive) to help out with our kids and my wife so I didn't have to miss more work than the day of the surgery as we are shorthanded at work. 


The day before, Tuesday, she tells us that her husband is having diabetic issues and wont be able to make it. This was inconvenient but understandable. I had agreed to work some time over the weekend along with my usually thursday shift in order to make up my time plus help out so I had to tell my boss I needed to back out. He understood but was of course unhappy about the situation. He and I convinced another person to come in and rearranged the workflow to accommodate the change. I am the most qualified person in my department so my workload is not going to be the same as our other guys and took some finagling but we made it work.


Wednesday comes, my wife is out of surgery and got back to her room right as I returned to the hospital after running home to let the dog out and have something to eat and informs me JNGMIL is now coming after all because she feels bad and is willing to pull the girls put of school and come that day. I tell my wife to let her know that wont be necessary but thank you anyway, I have it all sorted out. I have plans of taking care of my wife, hanging out with my kids, taking them swimming and whatnot once my wife can be left alone for a few hours at a time. But my wife and JNGMIL both insist that she should come anyway and stay til Sunday. Ok, fine, if that makes her happy then ok. One extra person in my house helping out isnt all that bad. I can do some extra stuff around the house while she takes care of my wife. I was absolutely incorrect. 


Thursday morning brings news that ""they"" are on their way. They being her and our nieces. I love these two girls, but you'll read why this is a problem. By when they said they left, they would be here around 4 or so. Didnt get here until 6:30, delaying dinner way later than we usually eat which was annoying but whatever. I grilled burders and made fries since these people are all picky and I wanted to make something that everyone would enjoy. I wasnt pleased about suddenly having to cook for a total of seven people, either.


Dinner went as I expected, I cooked and served 7 people myself. The kids (10, 8,7, and 4, mine being the two youngest) all hardly ate and demanded different food for each of them. My kids are usually good about food but they feed off of their cousins and follow their lead. Then bedtime was infuriating. The three girls (cousins and my daughter) were up until 2 am despite threats and many reminders that it is bed time doing ""a dance contest"" and gymnastics in her room while I was trying to sleep with the intention of going to work on my own accord in the morning (5 am). You may be wondering where JNGMIL is through all this; Downstairs on the couch with the occasional yell up the stairs telling them to go to sleep. Finally I doze off around 1230 and then my wife calls my phone from downstairs, someone left the gate open and the dog got out when the kids let him out. Yes, the kids, at 1 am. Somehow the cat ended up outside as well and neither of them were seen again until 0530 when I was abruptly woken up by barking in my house.


Now I'm up but I'm so tired and pissed off that I decline going in to work (keep in mind, I had no commitment now) and stayed in my room for a few hours. I finally start to fall back to sleep when the kids bang on my door asking for breakfast. I've never wanted to tell a group of kids to fuck the fuck off but I refrained, telling them to ask nana (JNGMIL). ""Shes sleeping and doesnt want to"". 


I ignored them at this point and stayed in bed until it was time to get my son up for daycare (no school today so my daughter stayed home). I did some yardwork and odds and ends, ran some errands, etc. and more or less filled out my day. The whole time, still having to help my wife with food, bathroom, etc. By this point I was so irritated and pissed off I said fuck it and went to the gym. I was exhausted I could barely crank out 40 minutes of cardio which is garbage for me. I pick up my son and we head home. The house is a disaster, JNGMIL is asleep on the couch with my wife on the other (lots of pain so lots of pain meds). I ask if there has been any discussion around dinner thinking maybe they'll want to order pizza or something easy like that. Nope. The kids want stuff that we have at home which again is no big deal, butnits more shit I have to do while JNGMIL sits while I help my wife.


Now as I sit typing this, I have bathed my own kids and gone full Gny. Sgt. Hartman on the whole group to clean up before they watch a movie in my daughters room before bed time while JNGMIL sits on my couch participating in some MLM bullshit video on Facebook.


TL;DR Wife's grandmother comitted to come help out when my wife had surgery. Cancelled last minute then decided to come anyway after I fucked over half a week's production at work to accommodate the last second change. Proceeds to bring two young children and not do fuck all."
342,"Background: You can go back and see my other posts, but MIL tried to take over my weekend with my family, who I never see.

The weekend went to plan and there was no back handed comments made, this could have something to do with my parents being there but all in all, it went okay. I also think that because MIL got her way helped keep her so happy, which agitated me. Not happy that we had to see them but atleast everyone was nice.

Anyways, so tonight my partner was talking to his mum which is how I found out why MIL was upset. 

Gossip: so for Christmas we are spending it with my partners family and his sister and her boyfriend are coming down for it (the sister that stole stuff from our house as a joke). Apparently her boyfriends brother found out that they were spending Christmas with this side of the family and just expected he would be going and gets to spend Christmas with us aswell. Keep in mind that none of us has met sisters boyfriends brother as he lives really really far away. MIL and SIL are put out because this was ment to be their family thing and ‘it’s rude to just expect he is coming for Christmas’. I have never laughed so hard!!! The shoe is on the other foot and she doesn’t like it!! KARMA! But it’s different because it isn’t what she wants !! I’m going to struggle to agree when they all bitch about it because I have zero sympathy! What goes around comes around I guess! 

It’s probably petty to be so happy about this but I can’t help it! Gotta love karma"
343,"Hello everyone! It's been a while since I last posted but that is mainly because it has been quiet on the MIL front. On one hand, I'm thrilled. I don't have to deal with her as she seems to be using my SO as her main point of contact (despite now having my phone number) and I'm totally cool with that. On the other hand I'm suspicious as hell because I have no idea what to expect. 

Turns out I had nothing to worry about on my end, at least not yet. 

My nephew is turning 1 at the beginning of November. My SIL1 and BIL1 (who is MIL's son) normally do the christening and first birthday all on the one day to get things out of the way. It a beautiful and happy occasion...

That MIL and FIL will not be making. 

SIL and I had been chatting about this for weeks and we had a suspicion that this was going to happen. That suddenly FIL was going to need to work, just as he did for their eldest's birthday earlier in the year. And you may be thinking ""well that is a valid reason"", except for one thing - they have been able to make it to all my other BIL2's kids and step kids and SIL2's birthdays no worries. In fact, in May FIL said: ""he would quit if work didn't let him have time off so he could go to BIL2 and SIL2's engagement party."" 

The moment that my other SIL and BIL have a birthday party or christening on FIL has to work. 

On top of that when they do show up they don't even try to talk to BIL1 and SIL1's kids, their focus is on SIL2 and BIL2's kids. SIL1or BIL1 have to step in and try and initiate conversation with them otherwise their kids wouldn't even be able to interact with MIL and FIL. To add to this, MIL hasn't spoken much to me of SIL1. On father's day before she found out about the pregnancy she barely said a word to me and it didn't heat up much afterwards. At SIL2's birthday I got a ""hello"" and was handed a bag with a beautiful blanket a friend of hers made the baby (I'm very thankful for it) and a carrier that make my very child development aware brain want to shut down as all I can see is future hip problems. Oh, and in case you were wondering, she didn't even ask us if we wanted one. She got it second hand from a friend and gave it to us (which is another problem for another day).

Getting back on track however, it's starting to become very obvious outwardly that they have their favourites. 

And to be fair I don't know where my SO fits because while he's given the same information as BIL2 about things that are happening, if they're up near us they don't organise to make time for him or us. So I think we sit kind of in the middle. However the more I see, the more I'm becoming concerned about our Baby Girl and how they're going to treat her. 

I've been a lot more transparent with SO about how I feel regarding his parents and their lack of communication with BIL1 and SIL1. If you're unaware, they'll come up to where all three families live (within 20 minutes of each other) and only tell BIL2 and SO. BIL1 has often been left out and found out about visits (where they have later BIL2 and SIL2's kid out) when the photos have gone up on the book of faces. It's slightly gotten better because the moment I'm told they're coming up, I message SIL1 and let her know if there is a ""family"" lunch they may not know about but it's gotten to the point that BIL1 is considering just cutting them off because he's had enough. 

Knowing this and having a Grandmother who played favourites and was a JustNoMIL herself, I'm refusing to allow my child to have to deal with this. SO is aware that I have my concerns but I don't think he realises just where I am yet. He's aware of how my own Grandmother was but I don't think he gets that I was more than happy to cut that woman off and I would do it in a heartbeat to his parents and it will be easier as I have no family ties to them. 

With them not coming to Nephew's party it will make it a much more enjoyable affair as there won't be a dark cloud of MIL hanging around, silently disapproving of the people that SIL1 and BIL1 invited. 

Despite this calm I know it's only a matter of time before she sets her eyes on me again. I thankfully have a potential visit of SO's brother's family (who live on the other side of Australia) and Christmas in between all of this so I can prepare myself for the Love Bombing and eventual ""When are you getting married?"" questions that are coming. 

Boy is she going to be shocked when I say: ""Baby Girl was planned. Many tests were done in preparation for her. If we were in any way concerned about being married we would have done it long before trying for her. Besides, we like living in sin, so it makes sense that our child and future children are born in sin as well!"""
344,"So I reposted a quote saying, ""Don't be afraid to lose people. Be afraid of losing yourself by trying to please everyone around you."" I reposted that because I thought it was a nice quote. Harmless, right? Wrong. The next day, JNMIL posted (as in she didn't repost it, she actually bothered googling the pictured quote) a quote saying ""I'm not scared of losing people, I've lost important people in my life and I'm doing just fine.""

Like what the fuck is that?? When is she ever gonna stop? I am so sick of her. I deleted my Facebook account because of her. Even my own mother noticed the passive-aggresiveness! Knowing that my mom is not really into drama, she told me to just not post anything on social media. Why do I always have to adjust for other people?? I'm so sick of JNMIL's bullshit. The made-up drama surrounding this woman is freaking incredible."
345,"First of all, I do believe in God, I go to a very accepting, progressive church. 
Secondly, I am a Masters level Social Worker. Mindfulness Meditation and Yoga are widely praised in our field for their mental health benefits. 

She calls me to tell me that she was helping out in a classroom (she substitute teachers for fun) and the teacher did something “creepy”. 

She goes on to say that the teacher made them breathe in and out. And then the teacher said “breathe out your negative thoughts” 
And that was it. That was what turned MIL off. To follow she said “they might as well be praying if they’re doing that!” 

——what??? 
She then tells me that she heard on the radio yoga is bad because it promotes self actualization which is equivalent to self-diety. By holding ourselves in a higher power we are putting something before God. 


Stop ✋ 

I am aware that yoga and meditation have associations with other religions. I get that. But COME ON. Meditation and mindfulness are becoming SO mainstream....

I didn’t even have a response for her. 


Am I off base?

Edit: She and I normally get along SUPER well. That’s why this is especially challenging for me."
346,"I am probably a very bad person for being upset

The story goes like this; I got married a few weeks ago in a my home country and we took my now husband's (sorry can't do acronyms as I'm a typist and discouraged when using them) family to stay at a place we paid for (which is a whole different story). All was going well. During the run up and the day itself my MIL was a bit touch and go some times but doing well. We decided to stay our wedding night in a hotel instead of the house we rented and happy we did. My MIL tends to have ""urgent"" medical issues and goes to A and E every that many months. It always ends up to be either nothing or something minor like a cold or an ear infection. 

After the wedding day we soaked our feet in the bath and were talking about how well she did; only one incident. Little did we know....

The day after we go back to the house and husbands sister takes us in the other room and starts to tell us that MIL had a moment (as now husbands refers to it) that night. Sister in law was getting something to drink for her 2 year old and she found her mother in the kitchen at 4 am standing at the counter. When MIL noticed sister in law she said she was dizzy and not well and feeling thirsty. She then collapsed/fell/fainted (sister in law wasn't sure) onto the floor. MIL insisted in calling 999 which my father in law ended up doing. She handed out orders while still on the floor apparently. The first responder came and noticed right away nothing was wrong. They checked her over and for a slight temperature there was noting wrong. The first responder said that there was no need to take her to the hospital but she insisted.  The hospital send her home within the hour. The attending couldn't find anything wrong with her. She then slept the entire day and insisted on not wanting to eat but we took food and drinks to her which she all ate. Even sister in law said; i've never seen her eat so much. The next day we to get assistance to get her to the gate when putting her on a flight back home cause she was feeling so faint. Sister in law said that on the flight MIL saw some people she knew and ""perked up"" and didn't stop talking to them and was asking for their phone numbers. 

The week before the wedding was not very nice (long story but lets say I love the family I married into) and put strain on us as a couple and then this left happened and it left a bit of an aftertaste with me.... 

I feel like a terrible person but was hoping that our relationship would have been celebrated more but it felt more like we weren't allowed to have that special time together. I especially feel bad for my now husband as my family fussed and celebrated with us while his drank and only cared about themselves."
347,"DH called JNMIL last night to confront her about her shit behavior over the last three plus years. Unsurprisingly and to be expected, the entire conversation was MIL trying to blame every bit of ill-will on me and DH unapologetically and irrevocably standing up for me and us 210%. From what DH says, the conversation lasted over 30 minutes and the entire thing was spent with DH trying to put MIL in my shoes throughout everything she’s done. Mil tried to deflect and change subject like no other, but DH cut to the chase and called her psycho, childish, and fake. 
DH tells me there were numerous times when he had to drop some knowledge on her for her only to be dead silent for at least a minute realizing how big of an ass she’s been. All she had to say was, “is that all OP wants is an apology?” to which DH replies, “do what you want, but don’t apologize to my wife unless you mean it and you should reflect on that.” 
While I don’t agree with my husband for giving his mom false hope that there is ever a chance of reconciliation between us (spoiler: there’s not), I am more than proud of him for sticking up for me and making his wicked witch of the west mother realize how terrible she’s been towards me from the very beginning. DH tells me there may be an apology coming my way some point in the future, but not to hold my breath. I told him that she’s welcome to apologize but she will not like the response she receives, as Ive told him countless times I want nothing to do with her and if it were up to me entirely we’d never see or speak to her again. 

Ive contemplated for a long time what I would say had the opportunity ever risen for me to confront MIL personally, but over time the response has become less angry and childish. Last night after getting off the phone with DH I took the time to write out my feelings in the nicest, most shit eating way possible to say “I win, you lose” without actually saying it. I’ve included my trophy speech to her here:

While I appreciate your apology, I want nothing to do with you. The last five months of zero contact with you has been peaceful, to say the least. Besides having to see and hear *husband* stress about you and your selfish disrespect. Which I’m sure you understand can be very disheartening because you know that *husband* is a very easygoing, lighthearted, and kind person. While you have seen me as competition for your sons affection over the last three plus years, I have no interest or need to compete with you because my husband will always and has always put our relationship and family before all else. I’m sure at this point you’ve realized where you’ve tried to put a wedge between me and my husband you have only increased the wedge between you and your son, all the while growing our marriage to be more resilient and loving than ever. I’m sure you’ve also realized you raised a good man who would put his wife and family first and ensure their happiness and safety above everything, including what is now no longer his immediate family. You should also take note that you’re the only one in the family that has a problem with me and you should probably look inward and reflect on that. I honestly feel sorry for you that you’ve had to resort to such hatefulness and disrespect to try and get your point across, whether you “think” it was intentional or not. I also feel sorry that you have to constantly gaslight and deflect any blame that comes your way for your terrible, shameless actions rather than being an adult and admitting your faults and wrongdoings. It’s pitiful you have to get others involved in your conflicts because you refuse to believe anything you do is wrong and can’t possibly understand why your son would stop talking to you for months and your daughter in law hates you. While you may have everyone else fooled, I can spot your manipulation from ten miles away because I was raised in the same absurdity, but was less enmeshed in the cloud of bullshit and am more than happy to tell someone about themselves when no one else will. You have never respected me from the moment *husband* and I moved in together and made serious steps in our relationship. You have tried to insert yourself numerous times where you do not belong and have continuously tried to make everything about you. You made yourself look like a complete fool at our wedding in front of all of our friends and family. I’m sorry to inform you, that you will not be puppeteering my family in any way, shape, or form, ever. I will protect my family at all costs, as I’m sure you understand any wife/mother would do. It makes me sad that I have to tell people to cherish and love their wonderful, caring mother in laws, because you could end up like me with one who can’t wait until you’re no longer around and hopes you don’t trap their son with children. Especially after confiding in her that you may not be able to have children, but your husband regularly tells you he’s more than ready to start a family with you. Sorry to remind you, but I will long outlast you because our marriage is a one and done type deal, so you’re stuck with me for the rest of your life. How very unfortunate for you. I know I’m unlucky in most cases, but I really hit the jackpot on a crappy mother in law. Thankfully I can take all the notes from you on what not to do when I am in your position. I mourn the relationship we could have had, had you not been so selfish, childish, and unwelcoming to me from day one. I mourn the relationship you could have had with your son had you not disrespected his wife, him, and his relationship countless times. And I mourn the minimal relationship you will have with our (hopeful) children that you never wanted in the first place, that will be heavily conditioned since you’ve proven to be untrustworthy. Your son is a wonderful, loving, devoted man and I love him more than you will ever imagine. As far as you raising him, that is where my respect for you ends. I am positive that had *husband* never confronted you, this apology would have never come because you don’t have the maturity to know when you’ve made poor decisions and said outrageous, uncalled for things. You can take this message in whatever way you need to, but just know, I wish nothing but clarity and understanding for you. And hope you realize where you can do better before you ruin the relationship with your future in laws from *sister in law*. Thank you for apologizing, but you’re more than late for that train.

So yeah. There’s that. I apologize for the absolute word vomit that is this post, but it all needed to be said. This has been a long time coming and I am not sure how to feel about it. I refuse to be expected to just forgive MIL and let this be put in the past. I am absolutely one to hold grudges and I know when someone is a soul-sucking, negative energy and that is MIL. I will not submit my future family to that, I just won’t. Thankfully, DH has full on warned her that if any of this bullshit carries over to our children, there will be an immediate no contact order. This applies to both his family and mine. While DH hopes the relationship can be rebuilt, it’s just a no go for me. I have no problem cutting people off as I’ve had to do it with my own parents. So I definitely have no problem doing it to people I barely know and care for. MIL messed with the wrong DIL. 

Thanks for reading this far. Please be gentle with me. I’m just happy I have a wonderful husband who has been the best partner in all of this."
348,"I have a son from a previous relationship. He’s 9 and he’s pretty awesome. He and my fiancée are two peas in a pod. My fiancée mentioned to her mom recently that my son had gotten a book at grandparents night with my mostly jymom. For what it’s worth at kiddos school grandparents night is just a night during book fair week that’s an excuse to get the grands to bring the kids to book fair and spend money. Nothing crazy special. It’s always been something my mom does with my son. Anyways. Fmil made a big deal out of being left out and not being invited to grandparents night. Honestly it’s frustrating. My son does not refer to them as grandparents. I’m not going to make him do so.  Not to mention Ffil has shown up and been great with my son but Fmil rarely shows for anything because she’s sick or has a migraine. I’m also not going to make a night that’s always been something my mom does with him be something they have to share. Idk, is that petty? Should I have invited them?"
349,"New user and first post, on mobile, so sorry for any typos and whatnot. 

I don't need any advice, but figured I would share because it made me giggle at the end. 

Bit of background, I have been NC from MIL for about 7 years. DH had been low contact during the 7 years, like 5 text messages and maybe 1 phone call a year. This past May he went full NC. MIL lives several states away (a good 10 or more hours). I only met the woman once. I can share more background and stories in other posts if desired. 

There is a bit of bad history between my DH and his MIL. When he was a child(some where between 8 and 10 years old ), she literally pulled the ""I am going to get milk"" and didn't fucking come back and left him with his step dad. So I will refer to her as Expired Milk.

Since my DH went NC, I would occasionally check out Expired Milk's book of faces profile just to kinda keep an eye out. She isnt doing good health wise and neither is her husband. So she says, they have been dying for years *eye roll* but I generally want to prepared incase shit hit the fan. Side note, I am not friends with her on the book of faces, but her profile is completely open for anyone to see. 

Now Expired Milk will post 20 to 30 times a day from anything and everything about cats, political stuff and how great of a mother and grandmother she is. Barf. She doesnt even know she has a second grandchild born last year so yeah... you sure are winning grandma. 

I checked her book of faces profile and see she hasn't posted in 2 weeks. I though it was odd, did she really die? Then I remember she had another profile. Did Expired Milk accidentally log into that one? No!

Expired Milk made a whole new profile and the first thing I see is that she is working in my state in a city that is 3 hours from where I live. I freaked and started scrolling and there is a shit ton of job updates, all working in the city..... then... where she currently works now, states away.....

Y'all, when Expired Milk made her profile she added every job she ever had (she use to live in city) and added it as where she was currently working.

Phew..... I giggled, glad I didn't have to put up the barricades and went to sleep."
350," So we were suppose to have dinner with my mil and after a lot of back and forth with my husband we were able to have an adult conversation and came to the decision that he would only meet her if she could do dinner with the both of us. 

So he told his mother this, and said I will leave the rest to her. So he didn’t reach out and waited all day Wednesday and yesterday to hear from her and guess what. Nothing. Not a single word. No call or text. Nothing, nada. 

I can only take a guess and assume it is because she didn’t want me there, and upset that my husband gave her that ultimatum. But I’m happy. I am so happy that my husband agreed with me, and finally understood where I was coming from. He knew that if I wasn't there she was just going to trash talk me, and he didn't want to deal with that as much as I didn't want him to as well. 

Now we just have to wait and see if she reaches out to him again, but she bailed on her son’s birthday dinner, one that she had initially planned, and he isn’t happy and she is just gunna keep getting pushed further and further away if this is how she keeps behaving and that is fine by me."
351,"The Squatter (TS) is my MIL, she is a boundary stomping, emotionally manipulative narc who treats my DH and even more so YBIL1 as her sonsbands, having been divorced from FIL for about 20(?) Years. We moved interstate about 12 hr drive from her to get away before DD was born last year. The Oracle that is the bot can keep you entertained for hours if you care to catch up.

So, I flaired ambivalent as I think I shut this one down pretty well and very quickly.

A couple of days ago she messaged DH to ask what she can get DD (15mo) for Christmas. Not me, not a group chat, because what would I know, I'm only her mother. Before he could say anything she said she wanted to get some kind of collectable that she can add to every year, and started sending links to DH. He is simultaneously sending them on to me. 

The links were for things around $100-$300 each!!! I immediately told DH it's not appropriate to give a 15 month old (by Xmas she'll be 18mo), a gift that she can't play with in case she'll break it. She just wouldn't understand. Its ridiculous. And whyvstart a collection of something for someone else? Collections are personal things. For all we know, DD might be into antique surgical tools or stamps! That's for her to choose when she's older. So I told DH no, tell her I'm not comfortable, and we'll send some ideas. So I sent her 3 ideas, which would be practical and well loved, get heaps of use, and guess what? All under $50 each. She then started looking at one of the ideas, and sent me links to the most extravagant version. Like, imagine I suggested a very basic paddling pool with ninextras, and she sent me a link to a 4 metre inflatable pool, with water spray parts and a swim up bar (Ha ha). For $150. Again, i said no, it doesn't need to be that extravagant, and the version you are suggesting she can't use on her own without our assitance. I showed her exactly what my idea was, very cheap, but could also then  be used by DS 2 later on. 

It just reinforced to me that she only does things for appearance sake. She wants to be able to put photos on bookface of her being this amazing, generous grandma who spends a fortune on presents. She is not actually thinking about DD at all. Stuff she was suggesting was her tastes, not necessarily something DD would like. She is going to miss out on so much with this attitude, and have no one but  herself to blame. Rather than spending stupid money on extravagant gifts to get DD to love her, she could start by face timing her more and actually let DD get used ton her and get to know her.  Cos guarantee, when DD is older, she won't be remembering $30₩ gifts she couldn't touch or hold, she will remember moments, and MIL is just not selfnaearenenough to realise this. 

Rant over!!"
352,"Apparently my boyfriend at the time (who I've now been with for 15 years) would also be quick to leave me. Oh and also she needed me to claim disability benefits, but she didn't want me to keep the money. *She* needed it more, of course. The woman's a fucking lunatic, honestly. Unsurprisingly, I cut off contact a few years ago.

All of this was after I'd been seriously abused by my father growing up. Clearly my parents were wonderful people."
353,"I have read this sub for awhile but this is my first post.  This is about my own mother who i love but has some serious issues with boundary stomping.   This story is about my sister and BIL but effects me as well.  Sorry for typos on mobile.  

My mom and sister had a huge fight.  This isnt new for them and i have always been the one to bring them back together and help them see the others point of view.  My big sis and BIL have been married for 16 years.  They are great but their biggest fights have been due to my mother butting in and not feeling like my BIL is good enough for my sis.  He is great by the way, great father and husband.  Hard worker just more blue collar than my mom hoped for.  We grew up poor but she is kind of a snob about the jobs of the men we date.  I know she is a job snob because i once dated a guy who was a janitor and she was so upset because she felt he wasn't good enough for me.  She had no other reasons to dislike him at this point.  

The biggest issue for my big sis and BIL is my mom showing up uninvited.  My sis would talk to her about calling first but always let her in.  My mom would always say it was my BIL trying to keep her away from her grand babies.  Well after years of this my sis finally had enough when my mom came out of the blue on a Monday night with three hungry teen cousins she was watching. She left them for my sister to figure out how to feed and doesn't come back until late that night.  My sis put her foot down about calling and my mom had a fit.  

Mom told family that she was cursed out and disrespected.  No curse words were said.  She also said that if she couldn't come over anytime then she would not come at all and that ""my grandbabies are old enough to just come to me now""  they are teens so this is true.  Mom calls me and tells me what happened from her side and says things like, ""if i were dead sis wouldn't care.""  And  "" I know BIL put her up to this.""  Well what really stood out for me was when my mom says, ""i know you and your bf would never do this to me.  I know you would let me come over whenever i want.""  Umm that's a big Nope.

So i live about 3 hrs away from my mom so that she can not just show up to my home unannounced.  Me and SO are planning to move closer maybe about 1.5 hrs away so that i can see my family more.  I let her know that she would need to call first even if we were closer but she just laughed and says moms should have the right to come over when they want.  I'm not sure how to get through to her.  Honestly, my SO would shut the door in her face or tell her to not come back, his spine is titanium.  He is great with protecting boundaries but i really dont want it to come to that.  This really has me rethinking moving closer.  I've been visiting once monthly but the 3 hr drive is exhausting. I want to be closer but keep boundaries.  Anyone had success with getting through to a boundary stomper?

TLDR:  drama with mom and sister about calling first.  Mom convinced its her right to come whenever and that when i move closer i will have no boundaries.  Not sure how to get through to her."
354,"Trigger Warning: Emotional Abuse(ish)

Skipping ahead a decade from my last post on my profile. Once again, I'm drunk. Otherwise, I would have gone into finishing school and... Well, My sister pointed out that my dad only did what he wanted to as activities and that got me thinking about part of this.

So. Backstory. I'm 16. My dad takes me out hunting for *some* reason. I liked skeet shooting, but I'm the kind of person that feels bad squishing bugs. He keeps turning his ankle and doesn't get why. Blah, blah... I finally have my then bf look up what the meds my dad is taking are for and it's ALS. I'm heartbroken because I've always been a daddy's girl. I always wanted him to love me and to approve of me, and I learn he's dying. And he never told me. It was 8 months after his first symptoms, he was in treatment and he never told me. But this isn't about him. 

I think I mentioned in my last post that Chrome Eater married my dad when I was 5. At this point, I'm 16, nearly 17, and we don't get along. I always feared how she would jump, so I would memorize what channel the tv was on so I could return it to that. I would play videogames she had paused and walk around for a short distance and leave it where she left it, my heart would pound and I would panic when the garage door went up because I knew she was home, and a dozen other things that I learned to do to try to avoid her getting pissed off. 

Now, I was upset as all hell. On the one side there was the train wreck (Chrome Eater and my dad) and on the other, loving sanity (my mom and stepdad), but my mom was devastated about my dad dying (possibly just because I was so distraught) and when the ALS Association suggested therapy, Dad and Chrome Eater agreed. Team Train Wreck went to individual therapists after a shared one confronted her about her abuse of me and she got all defensive and called her a bad therapist. So, one day, she comes back happy after her session and takes me out for sushi (her favorite meal and one of the few things that we both liked). We were eating and she was all happy and she finally told me that she was proud because she had realized that, when she first married my father, she was jealous of the time and effort he spent with me. Go up to the previous paragraph. I was *5*. She was jealous of a *5 year-old* and *proud* that she had realized it! I was stunned. It didn't get better and she forgot she had ever said that. Ask her now and she will deny it. 

That **bitch!**

Still, it helped me so much with realizing that it was all her.

Edit: spelling hard"
355,"So I Just Remembered this Crazyness from a few years back.

Cast: Me and MIL

This story happened 4years ago... I'd been with my partner for probably 2 years at the time. My MIL was fiercely protective over her two sons my now SIL Went through some things and stuff with her too.... The phrase ""no one can love my boys as much as I do"" strings to mind when I think of her.
She also took a keen interest in her son's passionate hugging lives.... So weird right?.... 

Anyway the story
I was hanging out at my MIL's house (my partner lived here at the time) I was just ... About in the house when my MIL calls me ""hey me come here a sec"" I find MIL in her room... She tells me to sit and turned to her cupboard.... ""What do you think of these?"" She's reaches into her wardrobe and pulls out this Lacey phlegm yellow lingerie set I mean THONG and Lacey half cup bra the white Lacey detail was a slight greyish colour.... 
Me""Oh! They're interesting"" 
MIL ""nice aren't they""
Me ""yer very nice"" lying through my teeth
MIL"" You can have them"" 
MIL then hands me the lingerie.... Now at the time I was a 32B cup and size 6 bottom... These! Were a 36D and size 14 bottom...
I hold the thong up to myself and say nicely ""oh I'm really sorry MIL I don't think I can take them... They don't fit"" 
MIL looks like I've insulted her in the worst possible way and goes back to her cupboard. I try and do some damage control ""sorry MIL. I really do like them but they're just not going to fit""  lies all lies!

She pulls out a pair of white and black floral knickers ""these will fit... You can have them"" she hands me the size 12 knickers. Knowing I'm defeated ""oh thank you; yer I'm sure they'll fit. Are you sure?""

MIL ""of course; I know son will like them"" 

Urgh! What!?!?!?!

So I left her room knickers in hand... 

Needless to say those knickers never left the house... I hid them....

Thanks for reading
I do have other stories of people are interested... I'm not sure what the procedure is but I have posted the on r/ripe stories as well."
356,"Note: this got long. Be warned.

Edit: formatting is hard

So, for relevant backstory: I have a JustNo who struggles with many things, regular human behavior being one of them. She has custody of and gatekeeps my teenage BIL, and, being able to smell all joy within a 50 mile radius, must crush it like it's a red flag and she's a 2400 pound bovine.

When we last left off, she was in the midst of A Crisis that could not wait until my anniversary brunch was over, and could not be spoken of over the phone. Because I guess news that serious must only be spoken of in whispers surrounded by her 437 newspapers and last week's room temperature beef stew.

She then proceeded to fuck off who knows where for about two weeks, so we assume that things have settled. BIL is a little less communicative than normal, but he's 17 and therefore required by law to be a pain in the ass, so we're not too concerned. He surfaces every so often for family dinner, and JNGMIL (she really needs a name at this point, because this is clearly not going to be over any time soon) hasn't had another Crisis in a minute, so we go about our business.

Until that fateful Sunday. See, it's 11:30pm and we're settling for bed like normal working adults, so naturally D(ear)H receives a call. JNGMIL, ever the responsible guardian, has just now checked her voicemails from Friday and discovered that BIL was not in school that day. Two and a half days ago. This is concerning to us, so we check his online student portal. Turns out, she's been writing him notes excusing absences for the past 10 DAYS OF CLASSES and is now so shocked that he is failing all of his classes. She can't do it; we have to take him. He is out of control.

DH predicts that this will all end badly for us. And it will, you all know it will, but we also can't not help BIL.

So we get him. He moves in with us, grounded (only to school, work, and back; no car) until he is no longer sporting an impressive 0.0 GPA. He starts attending his classes every day, turning in work, and lashing out at us in the process. He is unused to rules and reacts poorly, to put it lightly. An unfortunate side effect of being raised by the narckiest narc  that ever narc'd is that you tend to be covered in swarms of FLEAs that also smell of mothballs and bad decision-making. But our many struggles with him are another story for a different sub.

This tale is about the matriarch of the clan, who after exactly 25 days of silence and zero involvement decides she needs to speak to BIL now, so we need to drive him over there at 10:30 on a school night so she can lay down The Law.

No, we say.

This masterful rebuttal confuses and frightens her, so she retreats. It's super effective!

5 days later: ""Well, BIL needs math tutoring, so you can let him drive out to \[town 1.5 hours away\] on Tuesdays and Thursdays so Cousin can tutor him.""

Several responses come to mind:

1. Cousin teaches the fourth grade. Not precalculus.
2. Precalculus teacher, who DOES teach precalculus, is already tutoring him in precalculus.
3. He has no access to car while he is failing school. This is nonnegotiable.
4. No.

Well, that's not good enough (we find out later it's because JNGMIL wanted him to come move furniture at Cousin's house and I almost cracked a tooth biting back my feelings about that mess), so we have to drive him over to JNGMIL once she gets home from Cousin's house. (Also noteworthy, Cousin has a new baby, so guess where JNGMIL was the entire time she should have been raising the grandchild she's, you know, legally and ethically obligated to? But I digress.) She then says she wants BIL to stay with her for dinner, BIL agrees, we have literally no say in the matter so we remind her that his curfew is at 10 and go home.

The next day, BIL is in a surprisingly good mood; we are suspicious. We've been living in a cloud of teenage hormones and drama for a month, so we know immediately that there are shenanigans afoot. BIL goes to school, comes home to change, and is off to work.

Ten minutes before he is supposed to be off work, JNGMIL calls. You see, she's worried about BIL. We're being way too harsh on him, so she's taking him back. We have taken ""total control"" and he is afraid of coming back to us (Just a reminder for those following at home: we have taken his car, and won't let him go out on school nights. That is literally all). He is going to live with her again, and this time she'll ""make him mind.""

""And what if he doesn't?,"" we ask.

""Well...he just has to,"" is the well-thought out response.

We then find out that, despite having the only slightly less impressive 0.56 GPA, JNGMIL has let him have his car back and he is going out with his friends until 10 that evening.

""Why???!!!"" we ask JNGMIL. ""He's only turned in half of his make up work and is still failing 5 of his classes with a week left in the grading period!""

""Well, his girlfriend is moving in two weeks,"" is apparently the only reason for any of it.

(We also find out that, rather than work to make sure he goes to school, she will either let him drive himself or have the neighbor take him, because she has \*obligations\* to babysit for Cousin during the day and can't be at home. If only she had access to an adult relative with a flexible work schedule who could be at home before and after BIL's school day to make sure he did what he needed to do...)

We then get a call from Cousin herself, who has apparently been assigned the role of impartial jury (???) by JNGMIL: if Cousin thinks that we're doing the right thing, then JNGMIL will send him back. So we talk to Cousin. Who then says that we are doing the right thing and JNGMIL needs to send him back.

Predictably, she does not do this. Instead, she continues to call on other JNFamily members  to back her up, and not a    
 single one of them does. It would be so funny if it all weren't so horrible.

So, as anyone but JNGMIL could have predicted, BIL still ended up failing 4 classes for the grading period. The three he passed were as a result of the work he did here. We have gone NC with JNGMIL and only speak to Cousin so that we can at least still try to keep BIL on the right path in spite of the FLEAs.

DH predicted that this would blow up in our faces, because JNGMIL would just swoop back in when it suited her and give BIL everything he wanted so she could feel like the good guy and we would be the bad guys for once. I just hope her teenage grandson doesn't have to be the one to pay for it in the end."
357,"Ok I didn’t really know how to flare this because it is a lot of things in one (new user, TLC needed, etc). I have been a lurker and I really need some advice. I am on mobile so sorry for the format.

I have a mildly JNMOM (mostly BEC). She is really helpful in my life. She helps me with my school payments, taxes, appointments, applications, etc. She is really great at helping with the physical stuff. However, our relationship has been strained since I entered middle school (it has gotten better in the past year). I never went to her with school social problems because she would always say that it was just middle school (or high school) drama and thus it wouldn’t matter in a few years. While I understand that is true I really just wanted to vent instead of being blown off by her. This was the first thing that hurt our relationship is that I couldn’t go to her with social problems as she would always say it wasn’t important or she would say it was my fault (sometimes it was).

Fast forward to my main issue with her today. She has some JNO tendencies like guilt tripping and pity partying. She really knows how to lay on the guilt though. If we fight it’s always “I am a bad mom” or “why is our family so messed up” when I am trying to have a normal convo with her. I want to preface this by saying I am only 20 and my mom is a lot older than me, so when she tries to give me advice its usually in a guilt trippy way like “my opinion doesn’t matter” or “you don’t need me anymore” anytime I disagree with her. There has also been fat shaming and other stuff but that is for another time.

Ok so my main question is how do I stand up to her when she gets all guilt trippy without being mean? Also how do I stand up for myself when she is passive aggressive without hurting her feelings? I really think she acts this way because she has issues with her own mom and because she is starting to feel empty nest syndrome because I moved out 2 years ago and my younger sibling is 2 years away from graduating high school. I really don’t want to go no contact because I truly love my mom. I just want some advice on how to handle her when she has these JNO tendencies."
358,"I haven’t spoken to my mom in about a month probably. Last time we talked, she was trying to manipulate me (as always) and when I called her on her shit she flipped out, shut my phone off and told me to talk to her when I was ready to respect her or something. Context linked below.

[Context](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/d295q6/totally_normal_behavior_also_just_realized_while/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I got on my own insurance, returned my phone to her and got a new number. It’s been refreshing and peaceful being NC, but today she’s been emailing me that she got some papers in the mail from the IRS for me. She’s emailed me 4 times in the last 4 hours, two of which just being “please reply.” I know I have to get these papers but I’m dreading the visit. My fiancé is reassuring me that it will be quick and painless but knowing my mother, she’ll drag it out and make it horrible and there’s a likelihood that there are no papers to begin with. 

I can’t help but feel this is a slippery slope that I’m not ready to go down. The last month has been the best for my mental health. Any advice for how to handle this visit and retain my sanity?"
359,"This is an update to my grandmother who was calling me from strange number. 

We got married. I specifically told that entire side of the family the day was a week after. Doesn't really matter because it was an elopement anyway but boy, did I make the right choice. 

I had gotten a couple phonecalls from their area code from numbers I didn't recognize so I didn't answer any of them (3). So for what they thought was the day of, I took no phonecalls. Half a week later they call me four times from a number of theirs I *DO* have. I still didn't answer because I had just gotten a rejection from a job I interviewed for and my mood was already shot for the day.

So did they give up? No. She called my bio father to tell on me. So he called me. Except I can't stand him. So I literally just watched it ring. Now, has anyone up to this point left a message for me telling me what they want? No. My father very well could have texted but he didn't. Know what he did instead? CALLED MY MOM TO TELL ON ME AS IF I WERE A DAMN CHILD.

Not only that, he also lied about it. I had been keeping my mom up to date all day on what had been going on since I figured this would probably be the end result. So imagine her surprise when he tells her no one can get ahold of me and my phone keeps going straight to voicemail. He was pretending to be worried. She just told him I was out with a friend who was in town.

She calls me back to tell me I can't swipe reject when I get those calls because it'll send them to voicemail. But I hadn't been. I'm not stupid. I have stared and watched it ring out every time I have gotten a call. So I talked to her about it and she told me to handle it how I want but it was probably just going to keep escalating from there. I agreed but still didn't want to answer that day especially after what asses they had been about it.

I called middle of the day the next day pretending like I was going to lunch with this imaginary friend so I couldn't talk long. And the call went exactly as I expected. She acted like they didn't know the first or last name of my new husband. She sounded sour because I wore an actual formal wedding gown (I wanted nice pictures). She implied it wasn't valid because I was married in an ""elopement venue"" and not a church so I informed her it was, in fact, a chapel. She also tried to interrogate me about details. What's funny about that is she has never asked about a single thing since I got engaged. She never even asked to see the ring. 

Then she accused me of never telling them the date. Yes I had. Multiple times. I know because I always had to remember to tell them the wrong one. I'm leaving out a lot of the more underhanded comments because they're a bit identifying, but the real kicker is she ADMITTED it's been her calling from those strange numbers. I've been blocking them if no message is left after the first call so they get a recording saying the number is not available.

I would very much like to be done with this hateful old hag. Literally calling and telling on me so she can force me to take their call and get to insult me and my husband.

Tldr; it was her calling from strange numbers and she's a bitch.

Edited to add: I am probably never going to see her in person again but going NC on the phone would cause way too many problems for me and other people around me."
360,"I’m on mobile, so I apologize if this seems all over the place.  I’m also sorry if this really isn’t the place for a post like this.  I just find this community to be a very safe place.  I just need to rant a bit, and need some advice for dealing with my situation until I can get out of it.

My husband and I are currently living in his parents’ house with our newborn.  This arrangement is best for us in the long term, because it’s the only way we can afford to stay in the area while my husband finishes college.  He only has a few classes left and it is not possible for him to transfer, so we don’t have a lot of options.  The cost of living here is extremely high -we couldn’t afford our own place even with both of us working full-time before I got pregnant.  Finishing his degree will help the career/financial situation immensely and will allow us to achieve independence, so it is the top priority (obviously aside from our daughter).

My in-laws know we don’t have another good option while he is still in school.  They were the ones to offer that we could stay with them.  They’re only home for a few days a month because they travel for work, so this seemed ideal at first.  We have actually been renting their house from them for over two years, with roommates, and they lived elsewhere when not working.  So we already lived here.  They decided to move back in when the baby came and our roommates moved out.  I thought that sounded great when it was proposed.  But it has become clear since my daughter was born, that they feel like they can exploit us and do whatever they want since we are depending on them.

One of the first things that happened, I already made a [whole post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ceozls/mil_had_my_dog_stolen_while_i_was_in_labor/) about.  TLDR my dog, who lived here with us for two years with no issues, went to stay with a family member when I was in the hospital giving birth.  When I got out of the hospital, my in-laws suddenly announced my dog could never come home.

I was destroyed over that, and I almost packed my things and left.  I honestly think it was the worst thing anyone has ever done to me outside of causing bodily harm.  I will never forgive them for it.  But I was able to get my dog back and arrange for her to live with my (amazing) mom until we get out of here.  It is just too important for my husband to finish school.  I have wanted to leave since that day, but I am still here, trying to survive.  Unfortunately that wouldn’t be the end of it.

My MIL is a broken person.  She is 100% unreasonable and does not function normally.  I will acknowledge that she has had a very difficult life, some real nightmare stuff in my opinion.  But this is used by her whole family as justification for her acting terrible and having no social skills whatsoever.  She regularly loses her mind and becomes ballistically angry about random things.  This usually involves screaming fights, or long voicemails and text messages, where she says the meanest things she can come up with in the moment.  She is constantly demanding apologies and wants everyone to grovel, essentially.  I am realizing this has been a huge part of my husband’s entire life and has even shaped who he is.  She recently texted him, “Stop arguing and apologize like the humble bitch I know you are.”  This was in response to a simple misunderstanding.  She has these reactions to the most minor things, and sometimes it seems to be for no reason at all.

As soon as her fits of rage are over, everyone pretends it never happened.  The expectation is that the things she said are forgotten.  I am not sure if she even remembers what she says.

She alternates this with gifts and favors, which is her way of trying to be nice.  But anything “nice” she does is later used against you when she inevitably becomes angry again.  She also holds very strange grudges which are not based in any reality.  She seems to have it in her head that I am dishonest with her, although she has no examples or context for saying this.  It’s just something she has decided in her head.  Come to think of it, one of her favorite random insults/accusations is to call everyone a liar, even when it makes no sense.  (For example, she is angry that I’m sometimes busy with my newborn and don’t answer the phone when she calls.  She thinks I should feel more obligated to answer, since she bought my phone.  Except she did not buy my phone.  She’s thinking of my husband’s previous phone which she bought years ago.  When corrected, she flies into, “That’s a lie!"" or ""Are you calling me a liar?!” Etc.)

Honestly, the list goes on and on.  Most interactions with her are nonsensical, even when she is in a good mood.  Sometimes I actually start to feel guilty for how much I hate her, because she is clearly ill.  But ultimately that does not excuse the way she acts.  Her husband also enables her to the point of dysfunction, and he acknowledges there is no use trying to talk to her.  He knows she is mentally ill but he can’t make any suggestions about her health without risking a blowup, so he just dedicates his life to appeasing her and shielding her from reality.

Just to be clear, my own husband is an incredible person.  I don’t know how he survived his childhood and became such a caring, giving, hardworking adult.  I suppose he had no choice.  He does defend me whenever he has the chance, and tries to protect our boundaries.  But a lot of the time it just doesn’t seem to matter.  He can say whatever he wants, but she will never hear anything she doesn’t want to hear, and at the end of the day we still live in her house so she always wins in her mind.

I just need some tips for survival until I am out of here.  My husband and I agree that we will leave as soon as he graduates, and then it’s very likely we will cut them off entirely.  I will be VLC/NC at the least.  I also don’t want my daughter around her after seeing how emotionally abusive she is.  He has also communicated that he will support me if I ever decide I can't do this, and we can flee to my mother's house several states away if it ever comes to that.  But it is extremely important for us to stay so he can finish school.  I can’t stress this enough.  He has student loans and no way to finish his education anywhere else.  He only has this semester plus one more, and no university will accept a transfer that late.  Online classes are not available for his degree.  So moving away is simply not an option for us, unless the situation becomes dire enough to abandon his college degree.  I don’t foresee that happening, but I am on high alert and will not hesitate to GTFO if there is any threat of physical harm or if she is abusive towards the baby.  Other than that, I just need to get through this.

In the meantime, I’m having a lot of trouble feeling like I have absolutely no control over my life.  My feelings are irrelevant because of the amount of help I’m accepting.  I have nothing to look forward to aside from the days immediately following when they leave, until the dread starts building about their impending return.  I don't mind my day-to-day with the baby, and again, they are only here 5-6 days a month or fewer.  It's just the whole situation and dealing with them while they are here.  I need a strategy for surviving the next several months, and then we will be free.  I think I can do it.  I guess I just need validation from someone other than my husband, and maybe some advice for staying sane and dealing with her.

Thank you so much to anyone that read this.  Reading and participating in this amazing community has been one of the things keeping me going.  I really appreciate you all.

EDIT:  Fixed link."
361,"So todays vent is about my mom. I love her, she's crazy, and when dad passed 3 months ago she has some really annoying moments, but very few are around my 6mon dd. Dd keeps her sane most of the time but this habbit she has annoys the crap outta me 

My mom has a habbit of saying stuff to dd like ""what is mama doing to you?"" When dd is crying. I know she means it jokingly but its not something you wanna teach a kid to think that their parents are doing something wrong to her. I didnt say anything about it because she says it so few timea that by the time i am able to have a conversation about it its kinda way passed or ive forgotten. Especially while dd is young i want to be in the habbit of correcting adults out of earshop of dd unless its something major. My sil and bil corrected me mil all the time in front of kids for silly things and it taught the kids not to listen to mil who was their primary babysitter before daycare. So major things i do correct, and as dd gets older these statements will be corrected more quickly with age if she doesnt get it together. Anyway.

So today i took dd out of a dress before feeding because she is messy, only to realize i forgot a shirt to replace it and rushed to find one. Dd wasn't fussy at all and mom goes ""what is mama doing to you...your so cold"" and DH(who has heard these comments himself) says ""we really shouldnt be in the habbit of saying that. It could make her not respect out authority."" He wasnt mean, wasnt harsh (which he is sometimes but thats another issue) and of course my mother decides to pout for the next 2 hours before returning to normal.

These were the moments i used to call my dad and commiserate her insanity so having to address it without him is so depressing. Needs to be done bc i wont tolerate dd using some of these bad behaviors but it feels so worse because i dont have dad. Dh is quick to be annoyed by everything about my mom (as i am sure he says the same thing about me to his mom) so basically i dont have anyone looking at stuff from my eye level kinda thing. 

No real need for advice, me and mom will discuss tomorrow morning when she is in a better mood and can have a conversation like an adult, i just needed to vent somewhere neutral kinda thing."
362,My usually JYMIL had a lapse in judgement today when she told me I should get my tubes tied. I firmly said no thank you and she then said well one of you have to! I responded that no...we don't. And IF we decided to then that will be a discussion between DH and I. It's only a matter of time before she brings this shit up again. The only reason why the conversation stopped was because children came in. So anyone got a non petty comeback. I mean I'll look at petty ones for laughs but I don't see myself using them.
363,"Hi! So, first time posting here. I need some advice, or something. Let me start by letting you know my dear, darling husband has Aspergers Syndrome as well as a few different mental health illnesses due to being emotionally and physically abused by family, friends, and his ex girlfriend and her family. Sometimes he's there mentally, other times not so much. He's been through some traumatic shit, and seen some traumatic shit. I won't get into that here. 

Recently, before we moved back to California, we had been at my grandmother-in-law's lake house for some family event or gathering, I don't really remember what it was. Anyway, since I wasn't driving in Ohio, MIL and SFIL gave us a ride home to our apartment. The entire time, SFIL remained quiet. 

My husband expressed his wishes to go back to school to get the job he wants working with Blizzard Entertainment. His mother had the audacity to continuously tell him that he'd not amount to anything and he wouldn't be able to land his dream job. I was floored. I was in so much shock, I sat there speechless while my husband fumed beside me. The rest of the ride was silent. 

Neither of us know how to tell her, with all due respect, to shut the hell up. I'm supporting him and his dreams wholeheartedly because I love him, and at the same time, slowly helping him stand up for himself. However, if they're on the phone, she'll say something that puts us 5 steps back, and it's really frustrating. I'm at a loss. I don't want him to completely cut her out of his life, but at the same time, she's asking to be."
364,"I have one 12M boy and want one more child. My MIL knows this as we’ve had several conversations about it. Regardless, she will still ask/comment “so, your thinking your just going to have one child, right?”. Idk if she’s just not listening to me or if she thinks I don’t like being a mom or that I’m not cut out for two or what. She told me, super condescendingly that she “believes children are a blessing”. As if I don’t... I believe strongly in a women’s right to chose and she is very religious and hence pro life. Idk if she holds this against me and is the basis for her comments. Either way, her comments are shitty and condescending. I’m a great mom and love my child."
365,"I have posted a few other times about MIL moving in after her divorce/job loss/home loss. Sorry for the long rant, just needed to type thoughts out. She's no where near some of the stories I see here, but her living with us and being around all of the time has driven me to the brink. Especially because she's always in our business and gives no space. It's been around 8 months now.  My wife and I agreed and relaid to her that  January was the deadline for her to move out. First step is her getting a job which she claims she is working on (although she has a professional degree and there are a ton of jobs in her field out there so not sure how it's taken 8 months).  She's 60 so age could be an issue, but she knows she is basically going to have to work for at least 10 more years before considering retirement.

So this morning, she comes downstairs and immediately demands my wife (who is the middle of helping our daughter with home work) talk to her about if we need her to stay in the house while we are out of town since she was thinking of going out of town the same weekend. First, you're going to go out of town while we are for what reason? Because we are really looking forward to having a break from you on vacation, but having you gone a weekend in the future would also be awesome. Pick a time when we are here and can get an additional break from you in our own house. Second, if you leave then we have to pay for dog sitters, so is the goal to provide 0 help at all times? Not a huge deal, but seriously, WTF?

Wife and her go back and forth on it, mainly my wife telling her not to interrupt the home work and her mom demanding to talk about this right now. Finally, I had enough and said she just needs to move out if she needs to demand attention all the time. Told her that she invades our space, doesn't respect us and she's taken the comfort away from being home because she's always here and always up in our business.

Of course, this turns into the typical gas lighting of ""I moved in because I thought you wanted me to be part of this family, I knew it would take a year to get on my feet, blah blah blah"".  You can be part of the family and not be in the same room 24/7, sorry. And a year was never mentioned. I take fault that I didn't say we need to all sit down BEFORE she moved in and set expectations. She was going through tough times and both my wife and I treated her with kid gloves and in hindsight that was a major mistake. 

The good things is, she's on notice that moving out is ASAP and January is when the eviction notice gets sent, not stay until January and then more discussion. I have a real estate attorney friend, so well versed in what will need to happen. Luckily in my state it's a fairly short turn around.

Even though the whole conversation was heated and she ended up just going up to her room to play martyr, I am pleased. Expectations set on moving out and this likely leads back to her going hermit mode which she did for a bit and everything was more manageable."
366,"Obligatory on mobile warning. 
Also-although I would like blame mobile for grammar and spelling-I am horrific at both-they are hard. 

So my fiancée and I were recently engaged. He proposed with the exact moissanite ring (this will be relevant for my next post ) I wanted, and it’s more stunning then I could have expected. 
But this isn’t about our engagement. 

So I had to work at a temporary location for a few months, right beside a jewelry store. My boyfriend stopped by to visit a few times. On Black Friday I wanted to hit up the jewelry store to get something shiny. He kept telling me not to spend the money, well at the end of the night he surprised me with a beautiful white sapphire necklace. That to this day I love. 
We don’t live far from my parents, and we got home at a decent hour. I decided to stop by to visit for a few moments, and show them the beautiful necklace he bought me. I had already sent mom a picture message. 
I got to her place, she told me it was pretty. 
You know what-lets do it this way. H=her me=yours truly 
H-“you know that’s not diamond right?”
....stated in a tone steeped in what I call bitter joy. You know the one-where they are thrilled to give you bad news, but try to sound angry for you-or as if they are trying to teach you a valuable life lesson you don’t want to learn. Yeah, that one. 
Me-“yeah, it’s white sapphire.”
H-“Do you know how much HE spent on that”
Me-“I don’t but I assume it was part of the Black Friday special they had.”
H-“He spent $99, and yes it was the Black Friday special. *Tone of voice changes to pride* I looked it up as soon as you sent me the photo”
Me-“Good, I’m glad he didn’t spend anything crazy on it right before Christmas. Honestly I think he should have kept it to give me as a gift. 
Cue CBF
H-with disappointment “well, I just thought you should know. I didn’t know if he tried to play it off as something it’s not.”
Me-“Actually as soon as I told him I loved it he made sure to let me know it wasn’t diamond, he didn’t want me to think it was something it wasn’t. But he knew I wanted something shiny, so he brought me something shiny.”
Dad chimed in about him being a cheap mother fu*%#^ and only daddy buys me nice diamonds. 
Me-“yes, you bought me a beautiful diamond necklace for (milestone achievement), he bought me a beautiful necklace because I wanted something shiny. Cost aside, I’m thrilled he bought me a beautiful necklace this close to Christmas without thinking twice, simply because he knew I wanted jewelry”
CBF 
Her-“he should have waited until Christmas to give it to you” 
Me-“that’s what I said”
Her-“I don’t want to talk about this anymore, you deserve better I’m just saying....*abruptly changes topic*”
I’m sure this is just BEC but it’s always bothered me that she seemed so happy to try to deliver bad news. She had a hard time hiding her smirk. She likes to try and bring me down about things I’m happy about if she doesn’t think I should be happy about them. To the extend I didn’t want to tell her about the engagement until the end of our trip. If my fiancée hadn’t been so encouraging I wouldn’t have. 

When I brought this up later she claimed I had taken her the wrong way, and she was worried that he had been lying to me about his gifts. Despite that, I feel like the particular stone is none of her business. 
Am I losing my mind-or am I right to be wondering if maybe she wants to take away my joy?"
367,"SORRY THIS IS LONG

I could not be happier to get all of this off my chest, because while it has been a few months since everything blew up, I am still pretty angry and need to vent to anyone but my SO because I think it is hard for him to hear so much negativity about his mom, even if he knows it is all true.

A quick summary: my MIL/FIL bought a place, that they knew they would need to gut and remodel, only 25 minutes from me and my SO after we moved 3 hours away from them about 2 years ago. Rather than stay where they were and remodel this house over time, my MIL decided to move here and remodel while she lived here (my FIL has to stay in their old area for work, for at least another 5 years) but apparently she couldn't be that far from her son.

Fast forward to last year around this time, they decided to start the remodel at the start of the year and my MIL needed somewhere to stay for 8 weeks, so the construction could be done quickly with her out of the house. My SO and I agreed to let her stay with us (in our 2 bed 2 bath APARTMENT) because we are family and my MIL and I actually had a pretty strong relationship, so I assumed could survive 8 short weeks. Boy, was I wrong.

Immediately 8 weeks jumped to 12, then it kept getting pushed out and pushed out to eventually take SIX MONTHS! During which time she did not pay a dime to us, contribute to bills or food in any way, and constantly was in our living space not giving us any time alone. We didn't think we needed to bring this up in the beginning seeing as this is their second home (they still own where my FIL lives) and you would think that if you are living with people, you contribute in some way.  In addition, she would only make an effort to do things for my SO and when I had the flu, the only concern she had was if her son, who is almost 30, was capable of making himself dinner...fun fact, he is.

Over all this time she would make weird comments and not once was it asked of us if she could continue to stay beyond the agreed upon time frame. This started to wear on both me and my SO but because it was a moving end date, we just kept hoping the end was near.

About 4 months in (double the time she was supposed to be there) she approached me one on one and pretty aggressively asked if I was mad at her and if I had a problem, but she had to go to a pilates class in 5 minutes so I was on the clock. I was so caught off guard, and didn't think this was a conversation I wanted to have without my SO, I just said no and was trying to figure out how to approach it at a later time. 

About 2 weeks later, she again, approached me, but with my SO and played the poor me card saying she felt we hated her and she clearly needed to move out because she wants him to still love her (insert HUGE eyeroll here). Again, we said no, that is not the case this has just been longer than we expected and she assured us it would only be a couple more weeks. 

Thankfully, right before all of this started I began going to therapy for other reasons and my therapist encouraged me to speak my mind while maintaining that this is just how I feel, not placing blame. Because my MIL gets VERY emotional, I chose to write a letter which my SO and therapist read and said I wrote everything well and that I was absolutely just saying how her actions have made me feel and that I am happy to talk more about it. 

Well, that resulted in a huge fight with her blaming me for everything wrong with the entire situation, saying she has never been spoke to in such a way, and that she was leaving.  I asked her to talk with me about the letter to see if I could clarify anything or understand what hurt her, but she just avoided the question. We said again we wanted to talk about everything before her leaving, with her and my FIL when he came down the next day. She chose to leave while we were at work the next morning which only hurt my SO, not me. 

All in all, she has never had a conversation with me about what was so wrong and has only made efforts to get in my SO's good graces again. And now I am struggling with how to act with her since our relationship has all but been destroyed."
368,"On mobile, lurker but first time poster etc etc. Please bear with me. This is a long one...

This sub has been a Godsend since DH and I got serious. It's a long story with twists and turns and times where it honestly didn't look like we'd be together after all... but we made it! The only issue is his family has caused me a lot of pain and heartbreak along the way. 

DH (24M) and I (26F) met while away at school and so our families didn't get a lot of interaction with us together. I met his mother for the first time when she visited to help him along with his mental health (he needed antidepressants and couldn't get it from local healthcare and thus his mom brought it to him). This meeting didn't go overly well and the gist is, she was glad her son and I are friends, but were never gonna be together. We were broken up at the time. 

Fast forward a few months and my then just friends (FDH) moves away and realizes just how much he loves me and regrets us breaking up etc. I love this man with literally everything I've got so of course I cave when it comes to getting back together. I tell him though it ends one of 2 ways and he gets to decide which.
 Way 1: you put a ring on my finger, we get married, and I will be your wife. Period. 
Way 2: we break up again and I completely cut you out of my life never to speak to you again. 
He agrees and we get back together. I go back to school and he's still a out 4h away from his parents home continuing his own schooling. 

Little did I realize he'd been planning on proposing the next time we got to see each other. He'd started saving for a ring and shopping around etc. Well my DH being the ""patient"" man he is, decides he cannot wait and proposes to me in the absolute sweetest speech over facetime and that was that. I said yes. We were happy and we were engaged.

My family was thrilled. His family was excited but very hesitant. He doesn't talk to them much and us being away, they didn't really know me. Which I get. We start planning a 2020 wedding which gives 1.5 years notice for everyone. 

Fast forward again to about a year out from our wedding date. MIL calls me saying none of his family can afford to come to the wedding etc. I'm of course insulted (seriously... you all have over a year still to save and I'm from a small town where things are dirt cheap. Wtf.) Idk what to do. FIL is in concerning health so my JYM suggests we move the wedding there instead and do a smaller ceremony when our original bridal shower would have been and my family will cover ALL additional costs. 

Well DH family flips out. I start getting very cruel messages over how I'm a thoughtless little girl and dont know anything about commitment etc. I bite my tongue trying to keep the peace. DH sticks up for me and defends me very well considering. The kicker comes when his mother (MIL) sends an awful message attacking me and my character to my mom, me, and all of DHs friends. She claims the entire family has proof read it and agrees. This is the last straw for me and I tell DH I can't do it anymore. He can decide not to marry me or whatever he wants but I will not be spoken to in that manner. 

We eventually have a Skype call with DH, myself, and his parents where I was trying to let him handle the majority of things because I can be hot headed when I'm upset. He knew this and was doing really well. However his parents kept bullying me to talk and ""what? Can she not speak for herself"" etc comments kept coming up. Finally I blew my gasket which is exactly what they wanted as they started attacking me again and I blew up. 

Since DH and I were only planning a big wedding for our families and his was no longer going to be in attendance, we got married shortly after in a small ceremony at my JY parents house and recorded the ceremony for his family to watch in case they changed their mind etc. During this time, his parents tried to guilt him that they would've come etc had they known (they knew we were getting married and knew our exact reception date and still didn't show up for that either). 

MIL has since realized how badly she messed up since DH barely talks with them and I've gone NC. Shes reached out a few times but everytime I see her contact pop up on my phone I have a panic attack. I have abandonment PTSD from a childhood trauma as well as some other baggage this has drug up and I'm just unsure how to deal with it all. I know what she did was really messed up. She tried to play her hand and realized she was the only one at the table and playing alone is pretty lonely. Has anyone had anything similar and moved passed it? How do I move on from here? I dont see NC being a sustainable end right now as DH still really wants his family involved in our lives but respects my boundaries... how do I come to a healthy middle ground for both of us? 

Sorry it's so long and thanks for anyone who made it this far!"
369,"Hi,

I posted a little bit like a year ago about my mother and my MIL, who I named Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern, as they are similarly frustrating. However, my MIL has been going for the gold in the crazy Olympics this year, and DH asked me to float the drama to y'all for your advice and opinions. It's a bit lengthy, but I really need to express how exhausting this has been.

My MIL, Guildenstern, has been pressuring DH all year to fly across the US for his dad's milestone birthday. It's sooooooo important and eeeeeeveryone will be there and he just haaaaaaaaaas to come. Apparently.

But y'all. His birthday is Christmas Eve. And since everything from plane tickets to pet boarding is twice as expensive during the holidays, we had decided that *if* DH goes, he's going by himself, to make it a little less expensive. DH had told his mom back in the Spring that nothing is certain but he may come out by himself, and she immediately went on Facebook and announced to all 50000000+ family members that ""(DH) IS DEFINITELY COMING FOR CHRISTMAS AND ALSO MAYBE PANDA BUT (DH) WILL TOTALLY DEFINITELY BE HERE!!!!!1!!""

Which you may notice is not exactly what he said. But he gave her an answer she could construe into what she wanted to hear, and that's exactly what she did (sorry honey, I know you're reading this, and that one is on you, bud).

Anyway, we did end up buying DH's a plane ticket. But since then, it's become pretty apparent that this trip will not just be stressful, but very bad for DH's mental health, as it'll be full of PTSD triggers. Here's why, in helpful bullet form:

* DH confessed that flying by himself in a germ-ridden metal tube will definitely cause him major anxiety. He'd deal with it if that was the only problem, however;
* The plan was for him to stay with his parents, and be picked up/driven around by them. So there wouldn't be much of in the way of a quiet space for him, and he'd be held hostage to whatever places they drive him to.
* Oh, except his parents sold their house, and waited a solid month to tell DH that the friends they're staying with (strangers to DH and I) have an extra bedroom where he's expected to stay. It's a nice offer (assuming it came from them; DH thinks Guildenstern just invited him to these people's house of her own accord), but still an uncomfortable idea, you know?
* Guildenstern is also obsessed with the idea of DH meeting their church friends. ""I have to show them that you do exist!"" she declares. She will absolutely smother him with strangers.
* The party itself. Last we heard, Guildenstern was renting a ballroom. It sounds like every living member of the (giant, partly Hispanic) family and everyone she and FIL have ever met are invited. It'll be loud and crowded, and I probably don't have to explain to y'all why that will be a problem. Because y'all have common sense.
* Guildenstern does not believe in PTSD. That's the biggest problem, in my opinion. DH's trauma is a mix of childhood shit (that his family knows about) and military shit (that they have a general idea of). But when he's tried to talk to his mom about it, she always acts surprised. ""What? No. No you don't. Nothing happened to you,"" is her response. He recently told her that he's concerned about it in regards to this trip, and in between constantly prying for details about his military trauma (which, obvs, he didn't want to talk about), she stated that ""the Bible says to just give your anxiety to Jesus,"" followed up by a Facebook meme about what the Bible says about being anxious. And that's supposed to just fix PTSD I guess.

This week, Guildenstern texted DH: ""Please come to your father's birthday. We aren't mad about the tattoos.""

Y'all. She convinced herself that the only possible reason he's unsure about the visit is because he's *afraid mommy will be upset about his ink*. That she's obviously seen on his Facebook, and he's therefore not hiding. Excuse me for a minute, as my eyes rolled so hard they fell out and I must retrieve them to finish this saga of nonsense.

DH's doctor has recommended he not go. She even wrote him a letter, if he chooses to file a cancellation claim with the airline.

BUUUUT. He does want to see his dad and his siblings, and even his mom (in small doses). We've been listing things that could make the visit better for him: A rental car, and maybe a hotel, though hotels are far from his parents middle-o-nowhere town and it would therefore cost more gas to drive around, and IDK if we can afford it yet (his sibling's houses are full of kids and pets and aren't an option, either). And honestly? I feel like we'd just be rewarding his mom's shitty behavior if he goes. Like, she's going to see that she'll get her way if she whines enough, and it'll ""prove"" that his PTSD isn't that bad if he comes out anyway. But maybe I'm just being petty.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus drama: Rosencrantz, my mother, has also joined in on the whinging. ""(DH) haaaaaaas to see his family, Panda. It's been soooooo looooooong. And *really,* is his PTSD *that* bad? Surely he'll be okayyyyyy.""

I don't know why mental health is so difficult for them to understand. -\_\_\_\_\_\_-"
370,"Hi all, new here.  Need advice. 

My JNMIL has been a JNMIL since I met my husband.  Literally since day one.  My husband was not very good at shutting her down in the beginning. She decided when I got to meet my now step children. She summoned my husband to her home 2.5 hours away every other weekend when he had his children (EOWE visitation) to the point that he would be gone from Friday morning leaving for work until Sunday evening after he dropped them off.

When I was finally ""allowed"" to meet my step kids, it was on her turf during my husband's weekend visitation at her house.  This was also the same weekend that my children met his children.  My JNMIL accused my daughter of saying hurtful things to his daughter, which to this day I do not believe. Even though we were engaged at this point, his mother removed my daughter from group pictures because we weren't ""family."" We felt so incredibly uncomfortable that I ended up taking my two children and leaving - my husband said he was leaving but then she talked him into staying after I left. 

Once we got married, it seemed like she more or less at least accepted my existence.  She would text me or call me, 99% of the time though, the reason she was texting or calling me was because she wanted to ask a million questions about my husband.  I played along with that game for quite a while, until I finally realized that all I was to her was a pawn to get to my husband.  

By this point he was also getting tired of her narcissistic ways (everything is always about her and she is NEVER wrong), because I was pointing out every single time she was emotionally manipulative or controlling or demanding.  

Their relationship has continued to deteriorate due to the fact that she is overly critical and demoralizing, always telling him the things that he can do better. Every conversation they have at this point ends in an argument.  He has gotten much better at recognizing her behaviors and attempting to shut them down. 

About a month ago, he began asking her to give both of us some space, and to stop texting us and calling us constantly.  She continues to literally text us (group text) nearly every day despite no one responding other than to say please respect our request for space. 

Earlier this week, my husband changed his phone number because she would.  Not.  Stop.  After that she no longer had any way to contact him,  as she was already blocked on all forms of social media. My husband had recently switched jobs, and we had purposely not told her where he was working because of her history of calling his work when he refuses to respond to her. He did tell her the type of place he was working.  Yesterday she tracked him down at his employer and left a message with his boss that he needed to call her back immediately.  

After this I broke my silence (I had been staying out of it) and told her to JUST STOP.  Stop calling him at work,  stop contacting us, respect our request for space. She had no reason for calling him at work other than they just ""wanted to talk.""

I need to figure out how to make it stop. My poor husband and I are at the end of our ropes. My husband has a history of bipolar disorder and addiction and mentally this has just broken him to the point that Im concerned about his sobriety."
371,"Apparently my monthlies make me a horrible person to deal with and that was a nice one liner from my mother. 

The unpleasantness being her offering to buy a four draw filing cabinet online from a private seller and me stating I actually don’t need one. I literally don’t. My current important files all fit in one of those accordion looking box files, so I have no need for a four draw filing cabinet. I said no thank you but thank you for thinking of me. Which ended with her stating that I’d need one soon before she left and texted me that she’s sorry she’s so annoying and that she just loves me and grateful for all I do. I spoke to her briefly after some dinner, whereupon my monthlies were queried and then blamed for my attitude. The balls quip got an eyebrow raise from me though. I will point out if I’m not on my period, my mental health usually takes the blame if I’m anything other than 100% chipper. 

Her flip floppy, love bombing, you-can-never-be-mad-in-general-for-whatever-reason attitude makes me wanna flip a table for real.  She wants to drop 150 on a filing cabinet, but when I said I was probably going to spend the evening at the cinemas to see a new movie for 12bucks that’s apparently too much and I should consider waiting till the movie comes out on DVD. 

End of rant. Gonna have a hot shower and a glass of wine."
372,"Ok I don’t even know where to start. 

My mil is a narcissist who doesn’t listen here are a few things she has done. 

Made a scene because her name was not on my baby shower invite. Caused me to have a panic attack while 6 months pregnant. 

Warmed up my babies bottle when I told her I was doing room temp only 

Had a priest bless my baby without my knowledge 

Had a family member babysit for her without informing me or my husband. 

Some back story is we do live together back in 2013 or 14 she approached my husband(boyfriend the) and said she could no longer afford the mortgage. If he would start paying it the house would be left to him. It’s been 6/7 years now and his name in still not on the deed, so if something happens to them he is screwed out of all the money he put Into that house."
373,"It’s been a while since I posted here. Since SO and I moved, a lot has happened. If you’re new here, Forget-Me-Lots is my forgetful, argumentative and loony FMIL. Last year she lost 26K to drug addict cousin-in-law and we’ve been fighting to get her to a doctor ever since. We finally did it. 

For starters, my mom died in July. Since then, Forget-Me-Lots has been actually pleasant, although on occasion she forgets that happened at all. So this post is really going to be an update on her rather than a rage-fueled rant. 

I think FMLs memory is deteriorating further. But she went to the doctor last week and they performed a second memory test. She got 13/30 correct, and they ended up ordering bloodwork to see if she had a B12 deficiency or anything else abnormal. Next comes a head CT, I believe. Basically, right now they’re ruling out everything else before they diagnose with what I believe to be Alzheimer’s. FML was upset about the memory test, obviously. But she’s still going to her chaperoned doctor visits, so that’s okay. 

SO has been all bent out of shape about this. He had hope that it was some other form of dementia, and I think he’s secretly hoping that the head CT shows some kind of brain tumor, because at least they might be able to treat that. He’s coming to the realization that if this is what we think it is, his inheritance will be lost to a long term care facility down the line. 

AIL advised him to use FMLs retirement money to fix up her house as well as ours before she ends up in a home. Exact words: “You need to do the windows, the roof, and the patio because that money is gonna be gone before you know it and you might be forced to sell.” 

SO literally broke down to me and cried last night about this because he feels like taking that advice would be stealing from his mom. I feel so awful about this for him. So I did a little research and advised him to try to get long term care insurance before she’s diagnosed. I was a little bit angry that we’d never heard of this before. In all the time that I’ve been researching what dementia looks like, I never came across this vital information until I googled how people pay for assisted living. Still, it made him feel a little bit better. 

If we’d known this even a year ago, we probably would have been able to get her coverage. Now there’s bloodwork and a memory test on her medical records, so chances are that no one is going to add her to a policy. But it’s still worth a shot when it could save like 80K a year if/when she needs it. 

All I can think about through this is something my own mother said to me a while back, when I was confiding in her about this very fear. “Kids shouldn’t have to take on debt when they’re losing a parent. It should build them financially instead of breaking them down.” 

I really wish I could talk to my own mom about this and get her take on everything, though I doubt she would know what to do.  

Anyway, that’s all for now. When we get a diagnosis or long term care coverage for FML, I’ll happily update you all. If you have any advice, I’ll take that too."
374,"Hi everyone. So I posted here one time, my bf and I live across the country from our family. His mom is so emotionally abusive and rude to him. He is visiting her despite him not wanting to be there because you know - family. I’m not mad he is but after weeks of listening to how crappy his mom is being and just wanting to say something to her. I know- not my place and all that so I blocked her until I could calm down and he was over there and could have a face to face with his mom. Well he is there now, first thing she sent me in weeks is to ask how I’m doing, what I’m doing and omg she’s so happy to see her boyyyy but feels bad I’m ALL ALONE. I don’t know, something about the way she say it makes me so mad. Especially since I know she told him that she feels like she’s losing him to me and that he shares everything with me first instead of her. Like I’m his partner- duh. Despite making him miserable sometime. he still talks to her everyday( something I really admire about him because yo, my family piss me off and I barely talk to them a few times a year). She threw a fit when she asked him when he would visit and he didn’t have a clear answer because it was supposed to be a surprise for her. 

I didn’t know I was supposed to be in competition with her, you’re his mother- that’s something that will never break but relationships evolve and she’s making it weird. She’s got a husband yet she uses my bf as her emotional support husband. Please tell me if I’m just being sensitive about the texts."
375,"Another of my JNMIL jumping to conclusions, this time she always gets the lesser deal

So my JNMIL is a complete narcissist.
Every word that comes out of her mouth is framed from her opinion.
She also jumps too conclusions a lot, and I think she makes these statements to either stir or get a reacton that might lead us to reveal what we 'really' do or think.
Case and point- we had a family gathering in early August, we took our 5 month old baby to meet his extended family (her mum and siblings and their family).
So nice for them to meet baby and we all love her mum, she is a JYGMIL. I always wonder where JNMIL gets her traits from, because it's not her own mum.
So we go back to stay at the end of the month, it's just us and JNMIL (see one of my previous posts about this week, the one where she refers to herself, my DH and baby as 'us 3'). 

She immediately comments on the 'huge difference' in the baby's progress since she saw him about 4 weeks ago, then asks 'does your mum see a big difference when she sees him every other week?'.

No because she hasn't seen him in 8 weeks.

I nicely explain that my own mum doesn't see him every other week. In fact JNMIL has seen him more recently.

But seriously, why would she ask that? Only because in her head she is treated unfairly and gets the lesser deal. 
Woe is her, in her head.
We treat her unfairly, in her head.

She could be smart and ask me a question to find out what is going on in our lives, how is my mum doing, have we seen her lately?
No it's just her presumption, framed by her own delusions and mis-placed self-pity. Maybe looking for a knee jerk reaction that reveals a truth she feels she knows is going on. Except it isn't.

One more made up thing she said that week that I caught her out on:
We had a takeaway, next day she tells me that my DH told her we don't eat leftover takeaway food in our house, so she wants to throw my leftover takeaway food in the bin! 
No way, I'm going to eat that! (And I did!!)
Half an hour later I mentioned this in front of him,'why did you say I don't eat left over takeaway, DH?'
He says he never said that... She looks sheepish and quickly changes the subject. 
We all pretend she hasn't just made some shit up between us."
376,"Okay, I'm on phone and this is my first post so I'm sorry if I mess up. ￼


Background 


Four years ago I went into labor on Halloween, I ended up giving birth on November 4 but holy damn those days of labor were hell! I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. I. Was. Wrong. 


When we got to the hospital I was already 8cm and was rushed in and rushed to get hooked to the medical devices, my mil came in two hours later. 


Everything seemed fine and calm until mil wanted a cigarette and started to demand I start to push, then she tried to threaten that if I didn't start pushing, she will have to push down on my stomach to force my daughter out. Nurses heard this and made her take a walk and she left for a good 40 min. 


I went into labor and I was in the middle of pushing when she ran in, this being my first child and being in labor for so long with no pain meds or rest or food/water I was drained! Pushing was hard as hell and i just wanted to sleep! 


Well the moment my daughter was born was the moment I noticed that the entire labor mil had her cell phone out and was recording my ENTIRE birth! From my pushing too the stitching process (I tore 100%). 


I asked mil to delete the video, and she promised she did. It wasn't until a week later when we went to visit her (she had a ""emergency"") that I found she was showing random strangers this video and many of these strangers were men that she barley knew.


It took going to court to get the video deleted and after that she wasn't allowed near me nor my daughter... This isn't the only thing she's done. There's a whole other labor story of when I had my son and how bad she messed up. "
377,"Even though my MIL lives less than 2 miles from me, I am lucky enough to only have to see her once every few months. However, we just got back from picking up something from JYFIL and I have to vent.

Backstory: MIL is antivaxx. She’s “never had a vaccination in her life and she’s perfectly healthy,” says the woman who is always complaining about being under the weather (rant for a different day). Luckily smart SIL, that married in before me, made her get the Tdap before their first born arrived. Since that was about 5 years ago, I didn’t need to broach the subject with her when we found out I was pregnant. DD was born in March, so I didn’t push the flu shot on anybody beings it was the tail end of flu season (and I was super strict on visitors).

Cut to today: I told DH before we went over that he was going to have to address the flu shot issue with his parents, since that time of year is approaching and we have a 7 month old now. I have the opinion that my DD’s life is far more important than someone’s feelings on vaccines. No flu shot, no holding my baby after November 1st. Sorry, not sorry.

DH: “Hey, so you guys get your flu shot yet?”

JYFIL: “Nope, I don’t believe in those.”

MIL playing deaf and doesn’t acknowledge anything was asked of her. 

DH: “I’d pry consider getting one if I were you.”

Me to DH as we were leaving: “They’re gonna be real upset when I don’t let them hold the baby after November 1st.”

DH: “Yep. Sucks for them.”

Although we both have zero problems setting our boundaries, I foresee some whining in our future.

I’ve done pretty well not bitching about her the past 4 years, but I think it’s finally time to get it all out."
378,"Here’s the original https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/d5gsms/my_step_mother_drives_me_nuts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf 

So I have a little update for you guys! My father dumped the sorry excuse of a woman. She also now becoming r/entitledparents. She’s demanding money from my family because “you can’t just leave &amp; not pay me spousal support” the woman has never worked a day in her life. She and her family are now talking shit about myself &amp; my family, all because she can no longer sponge off us"
379,"Not sure where that flair went but **old story, it’s handled**

I work evening shifts. And luckily my workplace is less than 10 minutes from my house. This one particular evening, I forgot my purse when I went to work. My purse, which contains my wallet, which contains my driver’s license. So I had driven without my license. Oh well shit happens. No biggie since I had brought food with me and didn’t need to pay for anything on the way home. Just had to be careful driving home. 

That particular day, I happened to have one last task to complete at the last second of my shift, which made me go 40min OT. Naturally, I won’t be checking my phone while I am working. That and there’s no reception in the building and they refuse to give us WiFi access. So of course, 40 minutes after my shift was supposed to end, I get to my phone and once outside the building and getting signal, What else am I greeted with?

7 texts, 4 missed calls and 2 voicemails from JNmom. That’s probably tame compared to what most of you deal with. But she had my JNaunt in another country do the same as well. Because she was wooooooorrrrriiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeedddddd about where I was.

So I get home after finally replying to her blowing up my phone and alerting her to the situation. JNdad had taken the other car out of state at the time for an overnight trip. And another thing with JNmom is that she doesn’t feel saaaaaaaaaafeeeeee when her husband isn’t here at night. 

We live in the safest most straight edge town in this state. This neighborhood is the close knit type where everyone is all up in everyone’s business. It’s full of fellow Desis and East Asians. This is the kind of neighborhood where we could sleep with our doors wide open and people would close them for us. Nothing ever happens here. 

So the next morning, she whines about how she was scaaaaaaareeeeed because she was home alooooneeeee at niiiiiiiighhhhhht. Never mind that her preeeeeeeeciiiiiooooouuuusssss GC was home. And how she didn’t have the other car to come to my work to check for herself that I was there and that she couldn’t call the frizz because I had forgotten my license and she didn’t want to get me in trooooooouuuuubbblllleeeeee.

Welp, too bad I had forgotten my purse! The cops laughing in her face would have been epic. “Just so I have this straight, your adult daughter works from this time to this time, and you didn’t hear from her 40 minutes after her shift ended?” I WAS ALSO GONE FOR UNDER 8 HOURS AT THAT POINT.

She then whines “couldn’t you have called me from the laaaaaaaaandliiiiiineeeeee at wooooooorrrrrrrrk?!” No. I literally jumped from one task to the next and was not able to leave my fucking desk. My priority was to finish my fucking work. Not check my phone and text you every hour to entertain your fucking separation anxiety because the fucking “man of the house” isn’t around.

She then proceeds to casually mention that she went through my purse and found my fucking vape. She then starts lecturing me about how vaping is worse than smoking actual cigarettes and THERE HAVE BEEN VAAAAAAPIIIIIINNNNGGGG DEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAATHHHHHHSSSSS. If y’all have seen the vaping vs opioid crisis, you know that that’s bullshit. 

Also, I don’t even use nicotine syrup. I vape fucking CBD oil. Because I can’t afford to consume THC at this time. And I checked the ingredients label on my CBD oil. NO NICOTINE. And CBD is LEGAL. All I can say is thank JESUS she didn’t come across bud or psychedelics in my purse O_O assuming it was a rare occasion I was in possession of either. 

To conclude and before anyone asks. I am moving out in 5 weeks. TO A RECREATIONAL STATE. I only have to deal with this shit for 5 more weeks."
380,"Long time lurker, first time poster, on mobile, and so forth. 

On the whole, my mom can be very JY. When my car died over the summer and I was flat broke from trying to save the car from dying, she stepped in and loaned me enough money to buy a cash car from a coworker. She’s always been our (my JYSister and me) biggest champion. But lately she’s been taking some very JN detours. 

Last year while I was in the hospital, my sister told me she was pregnant. I was so excited for her, and she said she was only about 6 weeks so to keep it quiet for awhile. No problem, my lips are sealed. However, Mom decided to spread the joyful news to her entire side of the family. Sadly, she miscarried two weeks later. My sister was left to tell people what happened when they asked how her pregnancy was going. 

Earlier this month, the three of us were having lunch and out of nowhere Mom started ranting about how she thought it was ridiculous that there were people using gender neutral pronouns. My sister and I were immediately taken aback since Mom was the one who taught us to be tolerant of others and respect differences growing up. My sister argues with her, saying she’s not going to go out of her way to offend someone when they’re requesting to be addressed in a way reflective of who they are. My sister said it’s not costing her anything or harming her in anyway to refer to someone as “they” if that is what’s preferred. Mom said it was ridiculous and grammatically incorrect and she won’t humor the idea. She then said she was tired of arguing and changed the subject. 

My SO and I have decided to get married. We came to that decision in a gas station parking lot Wednesday morning and we’ll be getting married next weekend. I told my mom and my sister, as well as my cousin who will be marrying us. I asked them not to say anything since we’re not making a big deal out of it. Just want to get married quietly and continue on with our lives. Last night I get a call from my aunt (the officiant’s mother) asking me if I wanted her to bake any special cakes for the wedding. I was completely confused since I’m not currently speaking to this aunt due to her malicious stupidity on the book of faces. I thank her for the offer and request my SO’s favorite cake. I texted my sister today and told her that aunt knows about my wedding, and she said it was almost certainly Mom. I know it wasn’t my cousin because the man is a steel trap, if I ask him to keep it to himself, he’d take it to the grave. 

It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to tell her anything sensitive because I know it’s going to be public knowledge. And what’s crazy is she’s always complaining about how her other sister puts too much of her private business on the street! 

If anyone has any ideas on how to approach her or curb her blossoming JN behaviors, I’m all ears."
381,"Disclaimer: On mobile and trying really hard not to cry on public transportation so please excuse any mistakes. I dont know if I am supposed/allowed to give my mom a name here? And I dont rlly have one for her anyways.

I am back in my hometown, bc its bigger and a tourist town so it has a load more shops than the small town I am studying in. There's a special shop I want to go to, so instead of meeting my parents tomorrow at my grandma's place, I took the train here earlier to sleep over and get there with them tomorrow. 
Which is why I arrived at their flat about an hour ago so I wouldnt have to haul 1 kg of baked goods (I made for grandpa) thru the shopping center.  My mother is currently on medical leave due to a back thing, she's been at home for almost 2 months now. 

We talked a bit about our neighbors drama, about grandpa's dog drama (I mentioned in another post I think)  and then about smth that went on in my course yesterday. She repeatedly interrupted me (even tho when anyone ever interrupts her she freaks and yells at them to let her speak) and waved my words away, told me how much more she knows about the stuff I am currently studying at uni and then said ""now shut up, I wanna do my excercise""

She has like 3 shoeracks in a maybe 10sqm hallway, filled with all of her shoes, which on one shelf are big boots. I had put my jacket over the boots when I came, so their opening was covered by it so to speak? And then when I was getting ready  to go, I put my jacket back on, she looked at her shoes, reached in and pulled out a cat toy, saying ""whats this?"" 

I begin to say That's a cat toy, only get to cat, before she yells at me that she knows what it is and why the fuck I put it in her shoe? 
I did not put it in her shoe. I tell her so. She says she knows I put it in there because she saw it two days ago and took it out. I say well I havent seen it before today? Also why would I put it in her shoe? She keeps yelling that I put it there, or alternatively, I, like the dumbass I am, got it on me(??) In the other room and then moved it over to her shoes. I really do not know what kind of movement she was imagining there.

Then I walked away, kind of, to get my bag, remembered that I put tupperware containers with food in the kitchen and went to put them in the fridge. By doing so I accidentally pushed a tablet with her breakfast remains that was standing on the corner of the sink  into the sink. Then she told me to go to the bathroom and ""fix my teeth"" since i got smth stuck in there and she is grossed out? So I did that and go back to the kitchen for the tablet, only she is already in there and shrieking. ""So your stuff is more important??? IS IT? SO YOU NEED TO THROW MY STUFF IN THERE??? BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME?"" 

I try to tell what happened, she's like yeah yeah sure and continued yelling. 

So I did the only thing I could think of and the thing that this sub has adviced me of last time: I left.

In the middle of her yelling I just opened the door and left. I thought to myself that I really dont need to left myself get yelled at for things that I did not do or did by accident and was about to fix.

I had tears in my eyes walking to the trainstation and it took a lot to not break down. But my shame of crying in front of people is bigger than my hurt i guess.

According to my watch, my mother had me on the verge of tears within 53 minutes of arriving."
382,"Tw: medical discussions and disbelief of diagnosis. 

So my MIL desperately wants to be involved in our lives. I am very close to NC with her and DH is required to call her once a week as part of her having given us money to get through his going to nursing school. He isn't exactly thrilled with it, but it's just for a few more years until we move away from our current town where she also lives. 
MIL is a former nurse who is very anti science. She refuses to believe my diagnoses, despite the fact that we have plenty of proof that I have the illnesses we have told her I have. I am disabled and she gets angry every week that I don't have a job and that DH has to do the shopping as I cannot safely drive and there is no useful public transportation in our area. 
Last week, DH spent 30 minutes explaining what my most recent diagnosis is and that it isn't going to change as it is a genetic condition. She started crying when he told her that it isn't her business what we're doing to treat this disease after he had spent all this time trying to get her to listen to what he was saying. Somehow we are the bad guys because we are ""excluding her from every part of our lives"" despite the fact that she has shoved her way into every aspect of our lives, ridiculing us at every step. 
I might be over reacting, but it's incredibly frustrating to be treated like I'm a liar because my diagnosis is something she hasn't heard of before."
383,"Had a few requests for updates and figured it would be easier to just make a quick post. 

Tomorrow will be exactly 1 month since we ditched PF and hauled covered wagon for the not so proverbial frontier.

She has called and texted quite a bit, but only DH's phone. Guess she lost my number. Aww, not sad at all. I've been waiting on a call or email, but nothing has come to me. It's all gone to DH. 

She rage texted, apologized, called, got all ragey again, called, threw a fit on the VM, apologized, and on and on and on. Yall get the picture. 

The more interesting messages feature her guessing where we went. First she was 100% okay with us moving back to hometown. Now she's hoping we have fun in (insert random state here). I kind of assume she'll eventually figure out where we went (bc BIL has that info) but for now her guessing game is mildly amusing. 

She called several times on her birthday and was very upset by our lack of acknowledgement for her special day. She called the day before DH'S birthday and whined on his voicemail in a sorry excuse for a birthday message. 

All messages follow a basic pattern: she loves us (unlikely), she misses us (maybe, who will she stalk now that we're gone? She bored af), we need to call her back (urm, no), she's sorry (unlikely), she doesnt know what she did wrong (bald faced lie) and she hopes we're happy (said with sarcasm of ditched MIL). Sometimes she cries big ass alligator tears on the VM's. She's usually drunk. 

As far as we know, she's still in TN. A friend lives near her and reports she still sees the car coming and going. That won't last, I don't think. Not unless she finds a man to entertain herself with. I still suspect she'll move back to FL.

We haven't responded at all to any of this. Hopefully the messages will start to become less frequent before too much longer. 

In other news, idk how many of you guys remember the chicken issue between myself and PF. I know I talked about it in one of my first posts. Kids wanted chickens, I said no bc (1) we had nowhere to put them and (2) we were planning on moving (at that point nearby, but still moving) and moving with a flock of chickens is not practical. PF immediately became cool with having fucking house chickens just so she could overrule me. The same woman who yelled at my kid for spilling potato chips in her car was willing to haul goddamned live poultry in that same car if it meant she could get 1 up on me. At any rate, I vetoed hard. I was mean. I had to be the bad guy while PF, another adult, whined along with the kids that they needed chickens. #meanestmominthewholegoddamnedworld #theworstmom 

Maybe this isnt much of a victory, but the new house is a homestead-type property and it already had a big chicken coop on it. It was empty, but more or less ready to use. I got the kiddos chickens, y'all. Responsibly. You know, since we're settled in a house we'll be in for a while and there was a place for the chickens to go. 

We did not impulse buy them either. We spent a day fixing up the coop together, and then we went to the store and bought what we'd need to care for them and got it all set up and THEN the birds (a small flock of adult hens) were delivered. Kids helped with all of this. I really hope my actions will speak louder than PF's tantrums in their memories. I hope they'll look back later and remember 'mom got us chickens once we had a place to safely and appropriately have chickens' rather than 'mom and grandma got in a big ass fight in Rural King bc we asked for chickens and grandma decided we were gonna have chickens right the fuck now and mom  said no. Mom's mean.'  Like I said, small, petty victory but damn it, I did it my way and I feel good about that. :) Maybe it's super petty, but over the last 5-6 years, PF has taken a lot of decisions over and made them without my getting much input. Not big decisions, but lots of the small shit. It's nice to be able to do things my way without having PF butt in. 

Idk how many more (if any) updates there will be. Kinda hoping she doesn't show up on my doorstep and start a new saga of ""oh dear god, we thought there was a Raccoon in the shed but it turned out to be my MIL!"" 

May post some old stories if anyone wants  them or I'm feeling venty (y'all vote in the comments - you want stories or no? If yall want them I've got like 6-7 years worth). Idk. Right now it's quiet and I'm enjoying the peace. And our fresh eggs."
384,"Hi folks I need a little help. I haven't posted much but the bot will bring you up to date on how things have been.

It was my little ones Bday not long ago, and DH and I decided just to spend the day together, go for lunch and get lo a present.

In the am MIL texts him saying happy birthday lo and to stop in for lunch. Dh replies that we're actually going out for lunch. I didn't hear if he had invited her along or not but either way she didn't go. Later on during the afternoon, SIL texts and asks if we're coming over to hers or do we want her to come down. 

(little bit of background, we live in a very small town with both sets of families no more than a ten min drive away..if there's traffic. We're also having a low key bday party for both families soon. SIL had had a baby 6-7 weeks ago, c-section, but has been on longer car journeys with her kids between then and now. I didn't expect her to pack up her little one and come over but I also just wanted to spend the day with my little family and not have to drive lo around from house to house, to show her off like a prized pony! She always texts last minute and about plans, lunches dinners etc, and gets annoyed when people can't make it. I have been vlc with Sil and mil for the last year and a half. )

Anyway dh says we'll be home after x then lo has to have her nap, but she'll be up by 4:30 so feel free to come over then if you want. She says she'll see how her lo is doing. 

4:30 comes and goes. Nothing from SIL. 

Going on 5:30 I think, I can't remember exactly, but she texts dh saying it's too late for lo to be out of the house. 

Look I get it, she's doing what she feels is best for her family, but so am I, and not dragging my family from one house to another is what's best, especially since we do that every week and I think the families could do it just once for Lo. In the ten minutes that we had between getting home and putting lo for a nap, my mother came over to see lo and wish her a happy bday. (she had rang ahead and asked if she could come over, but she has her just no moments too just fyi) 

Dh was upset that his family didn't stop by but was also weary of them playing the woe is me we didn't get to see her card come the party. 

So today he wanted to stop by sils House, his mother was also there, so that they could see her and 'mend' the issue of them not seeing her. 

Oh boy. 

We started the discussion calmly and I admit I was an asshole and crossed a line by saying why would he want to reward people who don't give a shit about our daughter (bot can explain how they ignored her existence) by bringing them to her. Between her birthday and today, they have had plenty of chances to visit. 

We both eventually calmed down, talked about it and he decided not to go see him. 

He's in the fog, and he makes excuses for them, and I'm trying to be understanding of what a difficult situation this puts him in, but it just pisses me off, how little effort they make with my lo and then he wants himself and lo to maintain a relationship with them. 

In an ideal world, yes I'd love for lo to have a great relationship with both sides, but neither Sil nor mil have even said I'm sorry we were distant for the last year and a half, let's make this right. 

How do I fix this? How do I move forward? How do I forget about the last two years of them not giving a crap really about my family, without it hurting dh? 

Sorry for the long read, and yes again I know I was an asshole, so please if you can just give advice on how to move forward?"
385,"Just a weird story about my grandmother. She’s my mom’s mom and we’ve been NC with her since about 2014. Not a great person and just overall a toxic person, it’s been better for the entire family to have her gone. 

My parents recently got one of those Ring doorbells attached to their phones, where every time there is any kind of activity at the front door they get a notification on the Ring app and it begins recording the activity and saves a video. My mom got a notification about activity at the front door and saw that it was my JN grandma and my JN great aunt dropping off a large box and some other random items on our porch. In the video, they were having a conversation about putting the stuff on the porch, then they left.

When my mom got home from work, she opened the box and it was just a bunch of random old stuff. My JN grandma was definitely a hoarder for the longest time and it appears that she finally decided to clean her house. Inside the box was a bunch of old photos, Christmas gifts that my brother and cousins and I had made for her when we were young children (like colored pictures frames, pillows we had seen as children, handmade stuff from kids that normally grandmothers would love), and anything that at one point we may have left at her house. There was no note or anything indicating why she was dropping the stuff off, but knowing my JN grandma she dropped it off to be petty and kind of as a way to say “hope you haven’t forgotten about me!” 

Obviously, she was returning the stuff, especially the old Christmas gifts she’d received from my cousins and brother and I, as kind of a middle finger gesture to my mom. She had to go and drop it off at my parent’s house as a grand gesture to say “this is all trash as far as I’m concerned“ instead of just throwing it away or putting it in storage. Also, knowing her, she definitely put the old Christmas gifts in there as a way of telling my cousins and brother and I to fuck off as well, even though it was stuff we made as kids. When we went NC with her in 2014, my brother and I were still kids (I was 15 and my brother had just turned 18 and was still in high school) and she blames us for “cutting her out of our lives” even though the final decision to go NC was done by my mom and dad, and as kids we went along with it for the sake of mom’s mental health. 

Even after all this time she still has to make sure we haven’t forgotten about her, it’s so gross. She just has to keep injecting herself and trying to prove that she cares less when she obviously doesn’t. Oh, and if you were wondering, the majority of stuff in the box that my JN grandma left, my mom threw in the trash."
386,"So i got a call today from my mom while i was on my lunch break at work.

Bit of background: i live with my mom, gave up my place to help her keep hers.

My mom told me that she got a call from one of the senior places she applied to. The senior places she applied to after making sure me and my at the time fiance we already moved in an stuck with nowhere to go and no money to go anywhere.

Anyways, the people said they had an immediate opening and if she was still interested she could move in.

She said that yes she was still interested.

.....I am PISSED.
The only reason, the ONLY reason, she is not moving out now, was because during this phone call the lady realized my mom does not meet the age requirement to move in(you have to be 62, shes 60).

I called my ex, who still live with us he just rents out the smaller room(the whole thing with him rn is complicated), and filled him in on what was going on.

I called my mom out on what she tried to do. How she was going to take off and leavr the 2 of us high and dry in a place we cant afford to live.

She said ""i wasnt going to leave you immediately, immediate opening just means when your next check comes on.""

I said ""you mean when in comes on in November, you know, 2weeks from now!""

As i was talking to my ex i kind of got hit with this realization.

Why do i care so much? She has made it so abundantly clear that she doesnt care so why do i?

I always feel so obligated to got out of my way and put my self out to be there for her, but she wont hesitate to stick a knife in my back.

I have recently, joined a group a support group for people with eating disorders, talking to people and sharing things. I feel slowly slowly like my eyes are opening to the world around me.

I dont know what my next steps are going to be, but im going to start trying really hard to focus on me. I cant keep worrying about everyone else and what they what, and what they need.

For the first time ever, i need to take care of me."
387,"Recommended Mature Audiences

Backstory: DH and I have known each other since my freshman year of high school (nearly 10 years), we’ve been together for almost 2 years now. 
The relationship with MIL started off great. She met me right after DH and I started living together. We went to the mall, she bought us some treats, we went swimming, blah blah blah. It was a good day. 
Fast forward a few months: DH and I announced we were pregnant. 
MIL Is VERY religious. DH and I were not married when we got pregnant. 
Her first reaction: “Don’t you know how to prevent that!?” When we went to see her a few hours later she was so excited. Talking about what nickname for “Grandma” she wanted to be called and everything. 
Fast forward a few more months: DH and I moved into a place about an hour from MIL. I was about 3 months away from giving birth, unable to work due to health reasons. DH was working 40 hours a week to support the both of us but we were both happy. We had a family. We had our own little place. Everything was going great. 

And here’s where the mayhem begins: 

1. DH and I decided to get a kitten from the local shelter. We bring the kitten home and enjoy her for a few days before announcing that we had gotten her. 
MIL is allergic to cats. We knew if she came over, we just lock the cat up in our bedroom, and we would vacuum really well before hand. 
- As soon as we announced that we had the kitten, MIL’s SISTER comments “You must REALLY hate MIL!!” Umm, excuse me?? I deleted the comment (it was on Facebook), and didn’t take any further action on it. 
- MIL calls DH a couple hours later. She starts b*tching about how she’s SOOOO allergic to cats and we should’ve thought about that before we got the cat. And even threatened not to come over once the baby was born. (I’m rolling my eyes at this point) and also made the comment that “(Sisters) comment just magically disappeared off facebook” 
Um yes. Because I have lots of family and close friends (love them all) who would start commenting, defending us. And the last thing I wanted was a war on my Facebook page. 

2. Fast forward 3 months later. I gave birth to my baby. He ended up having to stay in the NICU for over a week. My mom was unable to be there with us every day as the hospital was nearly 2 hours away, and she absolutely could not miss that much work. DH and I totally understood. And it was fine. 
MIL lived 20 minutes from the hospital. She was there almost EVERY day. I was fine with it, until I wanted to breastfeed my baby, or go use the bathroom. 
Remember: I had JUST given birth and was healing “down there”. 
MIL wanted to be RIGHT THERE when I was breastfeeding saying things like “no you do it like this” and “make sure you’re pumping EVERY 2 hours in the middle of the night so you keep your supply up”.... She even stood in the room with me while I pumped. I was at the point where any sense of privacy had gone out the window. And I was emotional because my newborn baby was in the hospital with some serious health problems.
MIL also wanted to go to bathroom with me to help me with changing out pads and getting out of the wheelchair and onto the toilet and all that..... I DEFINITELY did not want MIL seeing THAT much of me. DH usually helped me with all that. But MIL kept trying to pry herself in and do it. 
It was incredibly uncomfortable. And her excuse of “well I’m a nurse I’ve seen it all before” was not good enough for me. I just wanted some source of privacy. 
DH finally stepped in and told MIL to let him help me in the bathroom when I needed it and to wait outside the room while I breastfed/pumped. She got upset about it, but she respected it. 

Things went somewhat smoothly for a while. Small hiccups here and there with MIL but nothing too crazy. Just small things like “you need to be saving money” and her “suggestions” (more like forcing) us to raise our baby a certain way. She finally gave up on that when we ignored her suggestions. 

And then this happens 2 days ago...

Small backstory: I have SEVERE postpartum depression. Due to this, my baby is living with my mom temporarily so I can go to therapy and get the help I need without having to worry about a baby. I am not currently allowed at my mothers house because my stepfather claims I’m “abandoning” my baby and they’re going to have to raise him (totally not true, I’m already talking with my mother about how we’re almost ready to bring him back home). Baby sees MIL every other weekend. DH and I meet with my mom (who lives an hour away) when we have the money (therapy is incredibly expensive), and see our son for a few hours. My mom even brings our son to our place for us to see him. We FaceTime with our son nearly every day. 

MIL texted DH that he needs to get a second job. DH is already working 4 days a week, at about 40 hours a week. The other 3 days off he has are spent visiting our son, going to therapy, or spending time with each other and “adulting”. 

DH responds back to MIL saying that he would never get to see his son if he got a second job because he’d be working 7 days a week. 
MIL responded: “Well how is that different from how it already is?” (In reference to us seeing our son) Um. EXCUSE ME!? She got ignored over that one. 

Being petty, I posted a status on Facebook with something along the lines of “if you don’t pay our bills, you don’t get to make decisions over our household” and tagged DH in it. 

I’m getting sick of MIL being so overbearing. When she isn’t practically forcing us to do things a certain way with our son (like makes the suggestion and reminds us EVERY SINGLE DAY until we finally agree to it to make her shut up), she’s telling DH how he needs to do “this and this and this” and he needs to quit vaping and that He needs to be a better man and blah blah blah. 

I’m ready to go NC with MIL because she’s SO manipulative. DH doesn’t agree. And we’ve been in arguments about it. I feel like I’m on my own fighting against a MIL who likes to stick her nose in business where it doesn’t belong.

Edit for side note: I feel like I’m overreacting. MIL has done a lot for us. But she also seems to want to hold the reins on the decisions DH and I make about our son and our household. Like contradicting us or telling us how that’s a bad decision and to instead do the opposite. Other than that, she’s good woman. I don’t know how to get her to treat us like adults and to respect the decisions we make for our house and child."
388,"After the reception life got a little rocky for SO and I. At the start of my second trimester my pregnancy symptoms got a lot worse and I had to cut down to part time at work. My blood pressure shot up while my energy levels plummeted and I started to get severe migraines; leading to me being closely monitored by my doctor. Shortly after I cut down at work SO was informed that he would have to find a new job due to some financial problems at the company he was working for as an independent contractor. Needless to say things got stressful, and that was just the beginning. 

During all of this what do you think was my MIL’s main concern? Our family’s future and security? The health and safety of her pregnant DIL and unborn grandchild? Nope and nope. While dealing with one of the most stressful periods of my life much less my pregnancy MIL decided she needed to nag me on a regular basis about writing thank you notes to her friends who helped with the reception. 

It started during the days immediately after the party, MIL stopped by to drop off a wedding card for us that had been delivered to her address. While visiting MIL asked if I had finished writing my thank you notes. I was taken back because the ones we ordered hadn’t even arrived yet, and I thought less than a week was a quick turn around for over one hundred thank you notes. I explained to her that we had an order on the way and I would get them started soon. MIL did not like my answer and condescendingly told me not to wait too long because I had to get them done within a month of the party. 

After she left I did a quick internet search to make myself feel better, and learned that everyone from Martha Stewart, Emily Post, and several bridal magazines said that I had within three months of the event to write thank you notes for that many guests. So a few days later when she text me about the notes I gently informed her that I had a plan to complete them. I let her know that I read a few articles stating the three month window, but that I did not plan on waiting three whole months. MIL smugly told me that I had “better not wait that long.” 

By the end of June (about a week and half after the party) my 11 year old dog who had some chronic health problems that had previously been well managed through medication and diet took a severe turn for the worse. We ended up taking him to the vet a couple times.  However by 4th of July weekend he stopped responding to treatments, and the following Monday we had to say goodbye to our sweet boy. I had him since he was a puppy and I was a total wreck. 

Then the following week (three weeks after the party) my brother was sent from urgent care to the ER with respiratory and cardiovascular concerns. My brother is young and healthy so this was a very scary time, he ended up having several follow up appointments before they figured out what was going on. While dealing with the health concerns my brother was staying with us to recover because we were much closer to the ER in case he needed to go back. 

Meanwhile MIL was well aware of both situations, yet she continued to call or text me regularly to ask if I had started the thank you notes because she, “really needed those notes finished.” It got to the point where I stopped responding to her because she was causing me to feel even more stressed out and guilty while my doctor was telling me to avoid stress as much as I could due to my blood pressure and the baby. I asked SO to deal with his mother, because she was driving me insane and I had enough going on already. 

SO had a talk with her over the phone, and reiterated that we were dealing with a lot; and that because of the baby I needed to avoid stressful situations as much as possible. He explained that being nagged about thank you notes less than a month after the party was not helping. I was sitting next to SO during this call and I could hear MIL angrily respond stating, “OP is just like you, I guess neither one of you like being nagged.” WTH? I didn’t think anyone liked being nagged at.

By the end of July my brother was feeling better, and SO had a job lined up and set to start in the next month or so. Things were looking up, but because the contract was still being hammered out SO decided to ask his parents for money to help get us through the rough patch instead of the honeymoon they had offered us as a wedding present. While I wasn’t crazy about the idea of taking money from them we weren’t going to be traveling during my pregnancy anyway, and frankly the money was a much better gift at the time due to all the medical and veterinary expenses. 

The day SO went to meet his mother I was at home just like my doctor requested trying to avoid stressors. My phone rings and I see it’s MIL. I begrudgingly answered because I knew that they just gifted us some money. MIL immediately started lecturing me about our finances and basically demanded that I get on welfare because we needed help and she wants to make sure “her baby” is taken care of. It took me a moment to realize that by “her baby” she was referring to my unborn child and not SO. I thanked her for the concern and told her I’ll look into it, but I didn’t think it would be necessary as we had a place to live that was paid for (we live in a house that my parents own), and that SO was going to be back to work before the application process for state benefits could even be processed. I also didn’t think we would have qualified at the time. 

MIL continued on about benefits for a moment and how she just wants “her baby” (gag) to be looked after. Then she asked me about the damn thank you notes AGAIN. At this point I explained that due to worrying about my brother, losing our dog, and managing my own health I just hadn’t gotten to them yet. MIL said she knew about “all that stuff,” but she really NEEDED the notes finished and asked that I at least write ones for her friends because her friends did “SOOO much to help with the reception.” This stung because if you read the first two parts of my story you’ll know that MIL pretty much excluded my parents from helping with the party choosing to have her own friends and family help instead.

I wanted the call to end because I was supposed to be avoiding stress so I agreed to work on them just to get her off the phone. MIL ended the call just as SO came home to a crying, hormonal, stressed out wife. 
I told SO about how she had started calling our child “her baby” and how that made me feel as a mother. That MIL wanted me to apply for WIC benefits as a result of him asking them for a cash gift instead of a honeymoon. Apparently she never mentioned the benefits to SO, guess that was a special conversation she wanted to have with me. I informed SO that MIL apparently “NEEDED” me to finish the thank you notes ASAP for her friends specifically. 

SO did his best to calm me down while also trying to manage his own mixed feelings about the situation. From his perspective MIL shouldn’t be stressing me out over these notes, but the in-laws had also done a lot for us recently and he did not want to confront her. While I understood why SO felt that way, I was still hurt over her behavior and wanted SO to handle it. SO offered to write the thank you notes himself, but I just knew that wouldn’t be good enough for MIL and I did not want to give her a reason to criticize me.  

Over the next few days I talked to my own friends and mother about the situation and they all assured me that I had bigger things going on other than some thank you notes. At one point I tried to sit down and write them, but I was feeling so resentful about it that I could feel my blood pressure rise just looking at the cards we bought. I walked away for the sake of my pregnancy and sanity. 

Later in July my friends informed me that they wanted to start planning a baby shower to help cheer me up and take my mind off all the stress. I made an appointment to meet with a gift registry specialist at a big baby store, and invited my mother to join me. Feeling generous (and also aware that MIL would probably have to work), I decided to invite MIL along as well to reward her for listening to SO and not calling to nag me about thank you notes for a week. It was also my attempt to be the bigger person and bury the hatchet. 

As predicted MIL could not attend (ooooh nooooo), but of course she took the opportunity to get on me about the damn notes. This time she explained that a lot of the same people would be invited to the baby shower so I had better write the notes for the reception if I wanted anyone to show up to the shower. MIL then complained about the quality of the most recent ultrasound picture I gave them for their count down to baby signs (Mother’s Day gifts). Apparently the paper was curling and it looked like “her baby had curly hair.” Hearing her call my baby hers once again triggered my inner mama bear. Instead of getting emotional and stressed out I simply said “okay, thanks for the advice,” and resolved that SO would exclusively be the one dealing with her from then on.

I eventually wrote the thank you notes and sent them out about 8 weeks after the reception. I had always intended on sending them and honestly would have completed them a lot sooner had she not been such a bitch about it. 

By mid August my blood pressure returned to normal while magnesium and iron supplements helped relieve my migraines and anemia symptoms. I don’t think it hurt that I had also stopped dealing with my MIL and let SO handle her.

389,"Reposted because in my anger filled stupor, I didn't realize the importance of keeping pet names off the internet, too. Thanks Mods for watching out for us!

My brother lives with my parents while he saves up money for a down payment on a house. He also owns a Chow Chow that also stays with my parents. The chow breed is aggressive in general, thankfully this specific dog is reasonable. He growls a lot though, which is the point of this story.

Every once in awhile, my wife and I need my parents to watch our daughter for a little bit due to work or other legit concerns. My dad is retired and has since calmed down a lot, but my mom is in a very high stress position at work that compensates her very well, so she bounces back and forth about the thought of retirement. As it stands though, she has very little patience, and therefore tells the dog to shut up when he growls. And she doesn't have a switch, so she says ""[Dog], shut up"" even when my daughter is around.

Imagine my joy when my daughter starts saying that on the car ride home.

This is the second time it has happened. And when I called my mom, her response was, ""Well, I didn't tell [daughter] to shut up, I told the dog to shut up!"" I asked her to please try, because I don't want my daughter to start saying it in school and she said she will.

I truly want my parents to have a relationship with my daughter. My dad is amazing with her and my mom can be too. I know I'm the asshole for trying to defend her from my wife, but that relationship is breaking to, and this is part of it.

So, what is the peaceful way to do this on round three? I really don't want to start the great rift, but it gets tempting more and more everyday.

As a side note, I am calling a doctor for myself tomorrow because I believe I have greater mental health issues than a therapist can solve. [Made the call today.]"
390,"My ex and I had a rough relationship from the start. Nothing the two of us could never figure out on our own. He was in his late twenties and I was several years younger. 

Whenever him and I fought about things, he'd immediately tell his mom. Him being the GC, my (ex)MIL would always back him up. She would most of the time send me a text or call me to make sure I'd clear the air. 

My ex and I broke up several months ago. We had been fighting for weeks on end and MIL would text me every damn night telling me I had to go easy on her son, that I had to apologize etc. I eventually ended the relationship as I could no longer deal with his absolute BS behaviour.

It wasn't pretty. First thing I saw when I parked my car in the parking lot at work was a text and six missed calls from my (ex)MIL saying I was a coward, scolding at me and humiliating me. 

To this day (it has been 3 months ago), I still wonder what part of her brain made her think it was okay to interfere in her adult son's relationship like this, and why the hell she went batshit crazy on me after the breakup."
391,"Trigger warning: I’ll be talking about my sexual assault here. If that’s bothersome to you please do not read any further than the first little paragraph, I don’t want you to feel hurt.

We haven’t found Kibble and Bits yet. Special thanks to the Redditor who sent my bf and I tickets to an amusement park. We’re finally looking forward to something. 

Also, in light of me finally moving out, I thought I’d reflect back on some of the things my JNmom has done to me over the years. I have a lot of stories to share, but I thought I’d start with one of the most recent and traumatizing ones. 

When I was 17 years old I met and began dating a 20 year old guy from my work. He was my first boyfriend, so of course I fell head over heels. I only saw him once or twice a week outside of our job because he couldn’t be bothered to sacrifice any of his time for me.

About a week after we started dating, on a Monday evening, we were sitting in my basement watching Netflix. He started trying to reach down my pants, I pushed his hand away but he kept going at it. It went back and forth for a while, with me saying “no” and “stop”. I didn’t know what to do, I felt uncomfortable and afraid. After much struggling he just stood up and yanked my pants off. Then he was trying to shove his hand down my underwear, which gave way to more struggle and consistent “no”s and “stop”s. I don’t know how much time passed, but at some point I realized he wasn’t going to stop so I just gave up. I let him do it. He was asking me if I liked it and I begrudgingly said “yeah”. I just wanted it to be over. The feeling of his fucking finger inside of me just makes me feel sick, you guys. Afterwards he left and I immediately drove to my friend’s house to tell her what happened. She helped me figure out what to say to him, and his response? 

“You didn’t say no convincingly enough.” 

I blamed myself. We dated for another month before he broke up with me because his mom didn’t like me. 

A few months later I met my current bf, and when things started getting intimate between us I hit a roadblock. I couldn’t touch him down there because it made me very anxious. He was so understanding, told me it didn’t matter, that it was okay if I wasn’t ready. My god you guys, my bf is amazing. 

Fast forward a year and in the car we’re talking about something when all of a sudden this memory comes flooding back to me. I froze, I got chills, and I felt dirty. I started crying and told my bf everything, and he was beyond pissed. We both still work with my ex. It was really taking a toll on me so I told my mom.. big mistake. 

I actually have a video recording of the interaction if anyone is interested. My nmom was screaming at me, saying things (and I quote) like “YOU allowed it! You allowed it by letting him come into the house and continuing to date him!” “Yeah, he lost control, all men do, but YOU allowed it!” “You’re gonna go stir up all this bullshit but I will NOT allow you to ruin someone’s life over this. I will not allow it!” “If you were really scared you would’ve screamed or physically fought him, but you didn’t!” (He’s a 6’3, 250 lb guy, I’m a 5’7 180 lb girl).  Then my enabler aunt who heard all of this over the phone, when I started crying and yelling back I heard her say “Nmom.. she needs to stop, she’s gonna get herself thrown in the loony bin talking like that.” 

It hurt. It cut me deep. She was the second person I confided this in and she told me it was my fault, that it wasn’t rape, that I somehow allowed it to happen to me. Still to this day I wonder if I could’ve done something different, I should’ve, I feel shame and guilt. Days after I remembered what happened I took two showers a day and I couldn’t scrub myself clean."
392,"First time poster here.

Usually my FMIL is very lovely even though we don't see eye-to-eye all the time. We got into a fight one time and I have come to realise that I didn't handle it well, but I still can't get her comments out of my head. Other minor incidents have occurred more recently that I can't stop thinking about.

* My permanent address is FDH's parent's house so I will sometimes get mail delivered there. FMIL re-addressed a letter that was clearly mine to FDH.
* While we were on some small vacations, FDH, while driving, would get calls from his mother because he wasn't responding.
* FDH and I went out to see a movie. He neglected to tell her that he was going to see a movie so by the time we left I had a message request from her on the book of faces. We aren't friends on there. The message request was (in this order) 2 missed phone calls. ""Hey OP, we are trying to get in touch with FDH. Has he been with you?"" And then another missed call. All within the space of three minutes. I ignored this, then asked FDH later if there was an emergency. There was not.

These are the ones that stick out most to me as I don't have that much contact with her.

I'm not sure if these are potential red flags or if I'm just overreacting. Whenever I'm around FMIL I just feel a little bit smothered with attention. I don't think she means any harm with it, but I'm used to not getting much attention from my own mother unless I'm in some sort of trouble. FDH is an only child and is used to getting 100% of his mother's attention and is always in contact with her. He thinks it's weird that I don't constantly talk to my own mom and that I rarely call her and says I can't hide from his mom.

Any advice is welcome."
393,"UPDATE: NO JNs were present! I will surely use the advice soon though. Thanks all. 

In about 7 hrs my husband and I are visiting GMIL who has been like a grandma to me for 10+ years. My grandparents live very far and I have always had little contact with them because they are JNish to my parents.

GMIL has been sick for a long time and has multisystem organ failure, her liver is now completely failing and they don’t expect her to be around much longer. So last night after many tears from mostly me (I tried to be strong for DH but I suck) we decided to visit her when my MIL, FIL, and SIL go today. That’s fine but then there is JN aunt who previously disowned us over a fight with my MIL which we weren’t involved in at all, missed SILs birthday (she’s a young child) and our wedding because of it, never apologized and tried to rug sweep. She’s probably going to be there because she’s been at this hospital with GMIL for a week. Another aunt created a group chat with DH and JNaunt in it and when DH messaged  eAunt privately he was met with scolding to message the group. Basically forcing him to contact jnaunt. I feel it’s a real possibility they’re going to try to push us making up for grandmas sake and I honestly don’t know how to deal. DH and I are on a united front but I’m concerned if 6 or more people gang up on us in person about it. Any advice on that would be appreciated.

Also any advice about dealing with funerals that JNs will be present at."
394,"Please no one, do not offer any kind of advice because there’s absolutely nothing that can be changed now.  This possibly belongs on one of the other subs but I know most of the people that worry about us will see it here and no where else.

Thank you Bitcho for being willing to let your grandson live on the street.  I thought I had fixed that and he wasn’t going to have to. A newish “friend” since I moved to the new city offered to let us stay with him till I got on my feet.  He had a nice three bedroom house with a huge back yard for DS and the dogs to play in.

Do you wanna know Bitcho that this new friend ended up being verbally abusive towards your grandson but even more me.  Do you wanna know that this new friend kept taking my car and leaving me and DS stranded and isolating us.  Would you care even a little bit that he almost became physically abusive with me yesterday.  Would you even care just a tiny bit that he kept threatening to kill the dogs, including your two oldest grandchildren’s dogs?  Would it phase you at all to learn that I was forbidden to get DS medicines, including the one he has to take every day due to the fact that he was born without his thyroid, or how about the psych meds that he’s now having to go cold turkey without?  Can I hazard a guess that the fact that I had to leave my controlled class 3 narcotic pain meds, and ocd meds there doesn’t mean anything to you at all?  Does the fact that I had to leave DS’s social security card and birth certificate there have any affect on you at all?  Would it have any kind of effect to know that the having to leave stuff there was by order of local law enforcement and that if I even tried I’d go to jail for theft leaving no one to be there for DS?

Can I tell you Bitcho that I almost had to make DS sleep in the car?  Can I tell you that law enforcement showed up again, a total of five of them and were attacking me?  What do you think of the fact that they told me I broke the law by not having papers stating Anubis was a service dog and by not having his vest?  Can you imagine for just a moment the sheer terror I felt when they told me I either had to bring him to your house or they were going to call CPS to come take him away?

Why Bitcho when I messaged you telling you what the cops said did you read it but not say something?  Why did you instead call the cops for your county and have them come tell me I was here illegally?  I did not know that, all you had to do was say so in a message and I would have gone back to the police where o was at.  Why did you feel it necessary to terrify DS to that point when he was beyond exhausted because of the time instead of a quick short message?  Can you tell me, am I supposed to be praising you for letting him stay in the basement with no heat?

Why do you hate me so much Bitcho?  What have I done to you to warrant you to hate me this much that you are willing to take it out on your grandson?

Will it make you happy to at least learn this Bitcho?  You and your son have won, you finally succeeded in doing what you have been trying to accomplish since daddy died.  I’m going to let DS get some sleep because he needs it and then I am taking him to CPS myself and handing him over because I am the absolute worst mother and I guess he’ll be better off with his dad that hasn’t been a part of his life for 10 years, just like his sister with her dad.  

You have finally won and completely and utterly destroyed me beyond anything that can be repaired at this point so for that I really truly thank you.

Edit: I want to point out I’m not going to go hurt myself, I’m too much of a coward to do so."
395,"Little background: Married 10 years, 4 kiddos, and a lot of crazy. Me and the kids have been NC since June. DH has been VLC since the same time. MIL (Queen of Cray) has been texting him almost every day. They range from acting like nothings wrong to memes talking about how its like death to a parent when their kids won't talk to them (melodramatic I know).

Yesterday: MIL sent DH one of her more melodramatic memes and DH just couldn't anymore. I got a text from him with a screen shot of what he sent her. I'll put it here:

""Alright I've officially had enough. We forgave you when you got drunk and crashed the care we were buying, when you fell asleep watching the kids and they both had kitchen knives, when you gave the 9 month old a bottle of \*prescription\* pills to play with, when you came to \*place we lived\*, ate our food lived at the pool and didn't help at all, when you stuck me with $5k of debt as a ""gift""... the list goes on and on. You have never apologized nor accepted responsibility for any of it. That's not even half the list of your narcissistic bullshit. And yet in your self absorbed mind, you're somehow the victim? What a joke. I have forgiven your bullshit enough times and I'm done with your martyr card. Leave me alone.""

OMG! I was so proud y'all! Like did a happy dance proud! Now of course the Queen of Cray couldn't let this perfect opportunity to play the victim pass her by. Among other lame excuses and backpedaling that made no sense she threw in this gem...

""I'm no martyr. I'm just a person, struggling to get through a life with more challenges that I ever thought possible.""

Word for word... this woman. But I wanted to share that with you guys. I never thought we'd get to the point where we are almost 100% NC! We have a few loose ends with family that still need to be tied.

Thanks for reading my drama!

Edit: Had to double check the quote from Queen of Cray."
396,"TW: Abortion and religion 

 I spent plenty of time on the phone with her when I was in my teens because I thought she and I had a really good relationship. I don't know why she would think that it was so good that she could talk crap about my mom. 

 My mom had told me about when she was  17 that her boyfriend pressured her to get an abortion. After she did she regretted it for a very long time because she didnt want it. However, the 1970s were a very different place and when a man didnt want you, you were considered trash. He threatened to leave her if she didn't..I digress.

 Lady Tremayne began to talk about what God considered an unforgivable sin. SIDE NOTE: Regardless of what religion you are if you were to read the New Testament there is no sin that is considered unforgivable because of Jesus' sacrifice. Because of this womans devout love of God she should know this and proceeded to tell my 16 year old self that if anyone were to have an abortion, they would be going straight to hell...
 
Im sorry what?

Then I asked her if she knew my mom had an abortion when she was a teen, and thus this bitch of a personality said ""absolutley"" 

🖕 you too bitch.

Life isn't black and white. You can't just tell people that they are going to see satan when they die just because they are doing something that may seem contrary to your own personal beliefs.... Its actually considered a sin to judge and tell people that soooooo..
 I only remember 2 phone conversations with her and both were shit about my mom and I had spent plenty of time on the phone with her throughout the years. This was the first time I had ever heard someone talk shit about my mom before so I had yet to dig out my spine...Stay tuned for more Lady Tremayne..."
397,"  

This happened way back in my youth, so no advice needed and is about a potential JNMIL.

 I was talking with a friend about the weirdest meal you had been offered and that reminded me about an ex and his mother. 

I met ex when I was at university, 2 people starting out as young adults and gaining their independence, at least that’s how it appeared. Ex had a flat on his own, which was useful for studying since it was quieter than the 4 bedroom flat I shared. Ex’s flat was a 2 bedroom which I found out his parents paid for, nothing wrong with that as my parents were helping me out, but the reason for the 2nd bedroom was so his mother could come and stay “whenever” she wanted to. Red flags were flying at the very beginning but I in my naivety didn’t see them, initially I thought it was nice that he had a close relationship with his mother. Ex had to phone his mother every night and tell her about his day. Whenever she came to stay, ex had to spend his available time with her, even to the extent of cancelling any other plans he had made. I did meet her a couple of times but mainly just to say hi, she was a bit stand offish with me but nothing nasty, looking back I realise I wasn't considered important enough to worry about. 

Ex’s previous relationships had been with the daughters of his mother’s friends and had been more friendships than romantic, so JNMIL probably felt in control. When she found out “things were getting more serious”, I think she realised she didn’t have the same control and felt threatened, plus I had been the one who introduced him to the “carnal delights” (yes she was religious), so JNMIL struck. She descended on ex’s flat and said she was staying for a month, usually she would stay for a weekend every 3 weeks or so. Her reason, she wanted to get to know me since I was obviously important to ex. Part of this was to have me around for meals. As a poor student, free food is free food and ex had told me his mother was a wonderful cook.

Now I don’t have allergies but I do have some food intolerances ie I won’t end up in hospital but I would “suffer” for 24-72 hours depending on how much I had. I am intolerant to gluten and dairy, plus raw tomato and pineapple would give me wicked indigestion. I can manage small amounts but would avoid having things at the same time. Ex was aware of this and had seen me “suffer”, so he had relayed this to his mother.

The first meal – she served spaghetti with a creamy cheese sauce, sprinkled heavily with chopped up raw tomato and more cheese (gluten, dairy and raw tomato), then for dessert it was apple pie (gluten) with custard and ice cream (dairy) ……. do you see a pattern?  It was not a pleasant evening.

Stupidly I gave her another chance, the next meal (which was the death knell for the relationship, mine with ex and JNMIL’s) she served gazpacho (raw tomato) but had added pasta (gluten) so it was like a cold minestrone soup, and cheese and pineapple toasted sandwiches (dairy, pineapple and gluten). Dessert was a bread and butter pudding with pineapple - even without the food issues who would serve these combinations?? I refused to eat anything. JNMIL got sooo upset I wouldn’t eat her food and wept and wailed to ex that I was so unappreciative. Ex took me aside and asked me to apologise for upsetting his mother. I pointed out that she had cooked the very foods I shouldn’t have and why should I be the one apologising. It devolved into an argument and me walking out the door. Ex did try to apologise and get back together but I realised a relationship with him meant one also with his mother and much as I liked/loved him it wasn’t worth my sanity or my health."
398,"TW: mention of child abuse

I just wanted to thank everyone for the advice they gave me a few weeks ago with my MIL and in-laws. Reminder, she’s the one who told my husband that I was “messed up” because I was abused as a child. A few weeks after DH let her know I was upset about it, she sent me a card saying how excited she was about the pregnancy and how we would all make a “fresh start” and oh, btw, IF she said anything about my dad that might have hurt my feelings she’s saawwwyy. So basically, a non apology rug sweep. I emailed her my response: 



“Thank you for your letter. I appreciate that you are trying to make things right. I just want to be clear about what you said and how it affected me. You told my husband that I was a “messed up person” because of the abuse I withstood as a child. It was and remains very troubling to me that you would use vulnerable information that I have shared with you against me, and make it a mark against my character. I no longer feel that I can trust you with personal information about myself. It is also worrisome to me that you would malign my character to my husband. It shows a severe lack of respect and boundaries for me and my marriage.  

I am so excited about my pregnancy and DH and I’s impending child, but it has not been an easy pregnancy thus far. I’m sure you understand that it’s important for me to minimize stress as much as possible during this pregnancy. I hope you can understand why I feel the need to remain at a respectful distance from you for the time being. 

I hope you enjoy the rest of your trip and I’m sure I’ll see you sometime over the holidays.”

I’m feeling good about it. I sent it a week ago and it’s been crickets since, so either she is taking it to heart and giving me the space I need, or she’s preparing a big blowup for when she and my FIL return from one of their many vacations. We’ll see, I’m obviously hoping for the former but am preparing for the latter. DH has my back on this. He’s preparing himself for pushback and wants to do whatever he can to support me, which feels really good. 

Now that I’ve told her how I feel, I’ve been more able to “drop the rope” and stop stressing about her so much. 

Thank you all again for your advice and support."
399,"So Miss Demeanor (nickname I kept forgetting to use - it’s because she’s attracted to felons) has been pretty quiet, however I did not appreciate her sneaking her boyfriend into our wedding reception this past weekend (we eloped and had a small reception in our hometown several weeks later) after DH made it clear that he wasn’t invited. We were under the impression that he was out of town visiting his kids until she was on the phone with him and he was walking down the driveway... We were so surprised we didn’t say anything. Calculated, as always. She was also very careful to do this in such a way that MILBF didn’t show up until FIL (her ex husband) left. It was so soon after FIL left that it seemed like MILBF had just been waiting somewhere nearby for Miss Demeanor to give him the all-clear. Interesting. We haven’t confronted her about it and honestly we haven’t talked about it between ourselves either. I want to think DH isn’t upset because he doesn’t expect much out of her anymore, but I know it hurt.

I realized while thinking about this that I’ve detailed Miss Demeanor’s personal transgressions against me, but not the way she treats DH and SIL. So, without further ado:

- For someone who talks about what a great parent she was/is, she cares very little about her kids. For example, she never asks DH or SIL how they’re doing/feeling, (especially SIL who has a slew of medical problems that more or less keep her confined to her house) but will tell us every single mundane detail (or in SIL’s case, inappropriate details about her sex life) about her life.

- She always tells me how in her home, no question from DH or SIL was taboo. They could ask her about anything; “if they’re old enough to ask, they’re old enough to know.” BS. There’s definitely subjects that aren’t talked about or are actively avoided by Miss Demeanor. 

- Her opinions are always the right ones. Whenever DH even slightly disagrees or points out holes in her logic, she purposefully says/does things to make him feel like he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I’ll admit sometimes he doesn’t know how to express what he’s trying to say, but if you understand his point he’s usually right. She does everything she can to make him feel ignorant; no one is allowed to be smarter than her, and this applies to most parts of her life, even her relationships.

- DH is the golden child (but not completely spineless, thank god), SIL gets scraps. Even when they had a relationship (SIL is NC currently) she would only check on her monthly. SIL has a lot of problems with illness, lives several states away and could use some extra support, meanwhile she’s breathing down DH’s neck (we live in our hometown) and he calls his sister regularly so she feels cared about. Part of me feels like it’s kind of a Jocasta-y thing. 

- When DH was in high school (and even more recently than that; she insisted she help him pick out clothes for one of our first dates) she constantly demeaned him for his clothes, his hair, etc. DH had a bit of a scene phase, but he was clean, his hair was washed, but every morning he’d walk out of his bedroom and she’s say “you’re REALLY wearing THAT?” And would force him to change, even at the cost of being late for school. He now has consistent issues with self esteem and doesn’t feel comfortable picking his own clothes (he wants me to pick clothes for him, “fix his style”, and I don’t feel like there’s anything to be fixed. I want him to be independent so I’m trying not to give in, as much as it breaks my heart. I did give a little and helped him pick out clothes for our wedding.)

- Probably my least favorite thing is how she talks about FIL. He’s not perfect, he makes a lot of sexist, racist jokes and tends to come off as abrasive but underneath it all he means well and he cares, he’d do anything in the world to help his son. They divorced when DH was 10, and he was led to believe that FIL was abusive, a neglectful parent, and an addict. The extent of “abuse” was FIL pushing Miss Demeanor onto their bed after she got in his face during an argument, he was never neglectful but he did work a lot, and the most he’s ever been addicted to is cigarettes. The real reason for the divorce was Miss Demeanor’s infidelity, in which she got a tattoo with the other man’s initials in it while she was still married to FIL and he had no idea. She later got the tattoo covered up and refuses to acknowledge that any of this ever happened (one of the aforementioned questions that she avoids). It’s also hypocritical that she cited FIL as being an addict and that being a reason for the divorce, as she’s dated many addicts since then.

I think that about sums it up. My first post talking about all my personal problems with her didn’t seem to convey all the resentment I feel, but I think this paints a clearer picture."
400,"I’m going to apologize now. I’m on mobile and I suck at formatting anyways. 

Here it goes: my DH and I are having our formal ceremony and reception here soon. As he is not home and won’t be home until a few days before the ceremony, I am in charge of putting the finishing touches on our wedding, which includes the DJs list of songs. 

DH wants to do a mother/son dance, if his mother even shows up. She’s a nutcase to begin with and it’s gotten to the point where DH’s spine shines brightly around her shenanigans. She was supposed to be invited to our original courthouse wedding, but had an absolute meltdown at the mention of my name from DH’s mouth (he was to invite her on his own). He didn’t even get to invite her because his family told him just not to speak of me in their presence and decided that if he couldn’t tell them, then they could find out through the book of faces or through someone else telling them. Cool cool, DH. 

DH’s mother was invited to our formals and may or may not show up. She won’t let us know yet. She may have “work”.  DH is hopeful and is really hoping she gets over herself and comes to terms with the fact he is an adult and is 100% capable of making a decision like marriage. DH wants to do a mother/son dance, but in his absence, it’s up to me to choose the song to give to the DJ. If she shows up and manages not to get thrown out of the wedding (security was the first thing I booked for this wedding) then the dance shall go on. 

While I acknowledge that this probably isn’t the healthiest way to go about handling my internal rage, I’m still going to do it anyways because: my wedding day, my fucking rules (don’t worry DH is slightly on board because he’s still livid with her behavior). I need your guy’s advice on the best passive aggressive songs for this mother/son dance?"
401,"Hello all! Long time lurker first time posting and would love some advice on how to best deal with my MIL. She’s not JN level yet (I think) but I really wish she was so I could never have to deal with her again. I’ll give you some background info and then the part that’s currently on my mind.

So my MIL is not a great person. Not to me, or her family really. Since the start of our relationship she’s been antagonistic, but my husband had warned me she would not like me so I just tried to be as agreeable as possible... but even when we announced our engagement she made it very clear she was against it, and tried to talk my husband out of it. She’s never directly bad to me, her ways are more subtle and insidious. 


She got married a few months before we got married which was 3 years ago. Late last year she told us she never loved her husband and that he was abusive. This kept going and got more dramatic until they announced they were getting divorced. We were supportive until she started asking my husband to pay her “soon to be” ex- husband $50k so that she could keep the trailer they had bought for $35k. Their argument was that they invested so much (her husband did the construction work) in the trailer it is now worth $160k so she would be keeping something she could sell for much more. 

My husband was skeptical and once we talked about it we realized this was only a hypothetical number that they were making up. I also pointed out it wasn’t fair that he’d have to pay for a trailer he didn’t want to a guy we hardly knew. We’re in our mid 20s, I’m in grad school and he has undergrad debt still. We have a good income, but we’re still establishing ourselves and that much money is not something we just have. 

He started questioning her about the numbers and asked them to get their home appraised so that he’d know how much they could actually get for it and she got really defensive. She started telling him he didn’t care about her or his 15 year old sister and said she should just kill herself and other manipulation tactics. 
They live in a wealthy city in a trailer park but this allows my husbands sister to go to a better school. 


She always says things through someone else so it was during this time she told my husband that her “soon to be ex” had told her that he already knew her son wouldn’t help her because I’m the one who manages his money. 
I quit my job last year to go back to school (financially it actually made more sense for one of us to be a student and I wasn’t growing at my job anyway so he really pushed me to do it), she’s really pissed off about that and never misses the opportunity to tell him how I’m taking advantage of him because of it. 

Drama continued. Her husband is actually an asshole so he cheated on her around March and at one point she followed him around town at 3 am with my 15 year old SIL to record him with his side chick and posted it on Facebook, sent it to his sons, basically told anyone who had ever met the two. I don’t think she was actually upset about him cheating because in February my husband and I had seen her and she had told us she was already talking to her ex husband. (The guy she cheated on with her current guy.) 

The way my MIL works is that when she’s mad at you she’ll make sure everyone finds out why she’s mad at you and side with her. She does this with her husband, her teenage daughter, me, basically anyone on her shit list. 

For example I recently met my husbands dads family in Mexico, they don’t have contact with his mom at all but they all let me know how surprised they were to see how pleasant and kind I was because she had made sure to tell them what a horrible person I was so they could tell my husband to not marry me. They never did because they didn’t think it was their place to tell my husband how to live or with who to live life with. 

This behavior of Hers has caused her a lot of issues now because we’ve found out she’s actually “working things out” with her husband. But now she’s embarrassed to tell people and yells at my teenage sister in law whenever she holds her accountable for the things she’s said. According to my sister in law she’s also still seeing her ex husband, which she has denied when it’s come up, and she tells her daughter she doesn’t think anyone has the right to judge her decisions. 

She sees herself as someone who’s very important to my husband because she’s such a great mom, and guilt trips him into hanging out with her or uses his sister to manipulate him into hanging out with her. She tells us his sister wants them to come over and spend the night at her brothers apartment. But she’s a teenager that’s always annoyed she’s not allowed to hang out with her friends because her mom is dragging her to other places lol. She also uses my husband as a threat to control his sister. “I already told your brother how you’re behaving and he’s pissed.” Basically prevents them from having a healthy brother sister relationship but I’ve pointed this out to him and he’s working on it. 


(Side note: This last summer we announced we were going to move to a city closer to our hometown, right away she suggested we move into her trailer so we could “save money, be closer to my family, and help her pay for the trailer” to which my husband said no. Instead we got a luxury apartment in a beach city, and she threw a fit. The first thing she did when she saw us after we had signed the lease was ask my husband, “DH, are you sure you’re the one who liked this apartment.” Jokes on her because I’m the practical one in our relationship and my husband decided he wanted to go all out and live in Brand new building lol.)


The last time (last month) we hung out with both his mom and his sister we had planned to go to lunch with them to an upscale celebrity chef restaurant. The morning of, she woke us up with a phone call at 7 am to tell my husband how awful his sister was behaving. They had planned to go to a concert that night and his mom was threatening to sell the tickets because my sister in law no longer wanted to go with her. 
Apparently (according to my sister in law) they had gotten in a fight the day before and my MIL had yelled and called everyone she knew to tell them what was happening between them and to “try to sell the tickets” because she didn’t think my sister in law deserved to go to the concert anymore. 

The next day my MIL told my sister in law to behave herself around her brother and basically not mention the previous day’s arguments. My sister in law being fed up told her she would not join us for lunch because she could not stand her mom or pretend things were fine. So that’s when my MIL had to call us to tell us what was happening. She tried to spin the story her way as she usually does. (She only tells you what you need to know in order to get you to agree with her). A lot of it was her victimizing herself, telling my husband all that she does for his sister. 

My husband already knowing her ways pointed out that she couldn’t use the fact that she drives her to school or makes her food as an argument because his sister is 15. He ended up telling her we could just go ahead and cancel lunch to which she said absolutely not. And somehow that cleared everything up because they were now on their way to our place. 


They arrived, having taken up all our morning, we had missed an event we were attending before lunch. 

During our lunch my MIL complained that we had taken her during the bad hour and that the place we were at was probably only good during dinner. 

Glared at me for extended periods of time in numerous occasions. 

Told us about a cruise she was planning to go with us??? To which I jokingly said hell no because I hate cruises. 
 
Mentioned some distant relatives 80th birthday party that is taking place in Cabo that she wants us to attend. 


***** My husband brought up a party Im planning with my family for my moms 50th birthday to which she demanded to be included in because the month before it is also her 50th birthday. We were surprised by this and didn’t say no but we also didn’t say yes? We were like “we’ll see” but she’s taken this and ran with it, and has started telling people were planning her party. 


After lunch we told her we were going to go to the event we had missed for a bit and she said she wanted to stay at our apartment. My sister in law (bless her) said she rather go to the mall and so they ended up doing that instead. When we came back they had obviously been fighting again, and my MIL was in an even worse mood. She put her feet up (with her shoes) on our couch and got offended when my husband pointed out we didn’t wear shoes in our apartment. 


They finally left and I haven’t seen her since, but last week my SIL came over with her dad and me and him got to talking. We’re both on my MIL’s shit list so we have a lot in common. He basically told me how much my MIL and her current husband talk shit about us to my SIL. They say I’m poorly educated and have no manners, and that I’m only with my husband because of his money (mind you he was unemployed when we met and has a ton of student debt). I already knew a lot of this but we’ve been together for 5 years so I would think it’d have died down by now but our new apartment has rekindled her hatred for my gold digger ways I guess.

My SIL never really tells me these things but we both know her mom hates me. 

Things are super awkward now because my husband has relatives calling him and letting him know how great it is that he’s planning his mom a big party. Thing is, he isn’t planning any party? I’m planning one for my mom. But she’s making this so awkward I don’t really know what to do about it now. There isn’t a huge fallout or anything to justify going NC with her but it’s really stressing me out that she wants a party when she so clearly doesn’t like me. 

So Reddit, that is why I’m here. This woman makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. And I don’t know how to approach this anymore. My style so far has been to lay low and let her expose herself because she does that pretty well, but idk I think I’ve reached a tipping point. I don’t even feel like pretending anymore."
402,"I'm new to Reddit - I've never read or posted before today, so apologies if I get terminology wrong. I was directed to this thread from a website about infidelity (the non-sexual kind). I think I just need to get this all out.

So, I guess, some background on my MIL.

When I first met her, I thought she was amazing. She was attractive, kind, outgoing, and always gave me compliments. I was living in a unit within a block of units her son (my now husband) owned, and the boundary breaking started slowly, but BIG. I came home a few times after work to my unit unlocked, or clearly having been entered. She was going in when I wasn't there - without asking - and helping herself to the privacy of my living space. I was such a people pleaser back then that I just let it go. She stood all over me, and did as she pleased.

When her son and I started dating, if she couldn't contact him she would call me - CONSTANTLY. I mean at work, in the middle of the night, repeated calls (I think the top number of repeated dials was close to thirty?), all backed up by sms with single words or short statements like 'ANSWER', 'IMPORTANT', 'WHERE S...?', 'PICK UP PHONE NOW'. And when I answered, no 'hello', no 'how are you'. Just a blunt, 'Where's my son? Get him to call me' \*Hangs up phone\*

So that was the early days. Fun times. Life was brighter.

Fast forward a few years, and here's a dot point breakdown of our greatest hits:

1. Two weeks before my wedding day goes into my room when I'm not there, finds my wedding dress, trashes it. Organises for my fiance to go out with friends, and invites me to her house that evening. I arrive to seven wedding dresses of her choosing, accompanied by some of her greatest quotes.

'You'll never marry my son wearing that dress (points to my original dress and laughs)'.

'Do you think he'd want to see you walking towards you in THAT? I doubt it. I'd walk away.'

'If you think I'd let my son marry you in that, then you won't be marrying him. You will wear one of these dresses. If these are not to your liking, I will take you to bridal stores tomorrow and select a dress for you myself.'

I gave in... but not entirely. I got a different dress. I hated my wedding day. By the time I got there, I was broken - that wasn't all down to her, my family contributed too.  At the reception, she grabbed my arm and told me to go get water for her, and for all the older relatives present. Her step-daughter stepped in and saved me. I was surprised she wasn't waiting for us in our marital bed - literally.

2. We lived in an old house for a while with a beautiful big verandah, where I would make a drink and sit on the front step. MIL decided we should have a table for that, and told me so. Cue multiple weeks of her sending me tables for sale, links to pages for second hand tables, messages saying she's at a place with a sale on and can get one RIGHT NOW SO ANSWER. I ended up, after verbally telling her no countless times, sending her a message and saying that I appreciated her thoughts, but I was happy with my home the way it was. She didn't reply.

A few weeks later, it's Christmas. My Secret Santa is so excited, saying, 'I was told you really wanted this. I'm pretty stoked I could get it. It's outside!' and you know how it ends. My Secret Santa had gotten me an outdoor table after my MIL had kindly told them a week earlier, I'd been talking about wanting one for months. My husband was totally ok with this. Said words to the effect of 'Sometimes things just get muddled in her head'. I smashed the table to pieces two months later and tossed it in the trash.

3. I was 39 weeks pregnant. MIL walked into my house, says 'Look, I know you're going to take this the wrong way, but don't, ok? Don't take it the wrong way? Because I know you WILL, but I'm not BEING offensive, so just remember that when you take it the wrong way.' To which I'm like, 'Yeah, ok, what exactly is it you want to say', and she says, 'Well I know you're not going to have that baby anytime soon, because you live in a pigsty.' \*Laughs and laughs and laughs\*. Husband smiles along with her.

4. Decides our lawn needs to be mowed. Is told repeatedly, 'Yeah we've got it sorted, it's not your concern.' I wake up one morning, heavily pregnant, to a stranger outside my window mowing our lawn, and my butt naked bod fully exposed. I called my husband, who hasn't organised it, but defends her right to do so. Fucking yay. I tell her in no short terms, to never, ever, do that again. She now tells me - EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE COMES TO THE HOUSE - 'I'm going to get you a goat to take care of this lawn!' \*Laughs and laughs and laughs\*

5. At my baby shower MIL tells my Mum 'Oh yeah, I think if it was up to (88), she wouldn't let me have a thing to do with this baby'. My Mum and another lady ignore her, so she says it louder - the exact same thing, in front of all my friends, when I've left to use the toilet. My Mum says in my defense, 'You don't say things like that about people when they can't defend themselves'. Everyone ignores my MIL.

Go my Mum. She's a rockstar.

6. MIL repeatedly calls her husband a 'f\*\*\*ing a\*\*\*hole', 'complete jerk', 'failure' in front of her other grandkids and family members (including her husband), and voices how 'he's nothing without her', and that she 'only stays with him for the kids'.

7. On countless occasions, MIL goes behind my back when I've said no to something, and asks my husband, who says yes. She then straight up lies when I call her out on it in front of him, and as always he makes excuses about her being 'confused'. She really hams that up for him. It would be adorable if it wasn't so bat sh\*t f\*\*\*ing crazy and utterly, utterly contributing to the destruction of our marriage.

8. In our hometown MIL is known as a gossip and a slanderer. She has literally walked up our main street and bitched to people about her husband, her SIL, and me. One of the people she spoke to was a client of mine, who was also a mother of a friend of mine. One day the friend comes to  me and explains how my MIL had ran into her mother on the street, and that my MIL was saying 'the worst things' about me. My friend explains that her Mum wouldn't even give her details they were so bad, and that she said to my MIL 'You need to stop this. It's not true, and it's not right. You've got to get help.' (Also yay for my friends Mum!). I tell my husband about it in tears, and he says, 'My poor Mum. It's not right that she (referring to my friends Mum) has gone and spoken to people about that.'

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, the list goes on and on. She's battling for access to her other granchildren at the moment, because her SIL despises her and wants her to have nothing to do with them. There is a whole other story there, and a sad one - my MIL lost her daughter to cancer, and the whole journey brought out the worst in her towards her SIL. They each treated the other terribly.  And at the same time, my husband became her only confidant. She had to have him, at all hours, all the time. I approached the subject with him a few times and said that I really needed him home, with me, and he told me 'Don't make me choose. You'll lose.' :(

So here's the crux of it all: in the midst of the cancer battle, my husband told me he wanted to start a trust with me for our generation and the next. We went to an accountant about it. We looked at two properties to purchase. It felt like a part of our lives was going the way it should have after our marriage, and it gave me hope.

A couple of weeks after, my MIL asks me what I think of the land she's bought. It turns out she asked him to use her money (she's loaded, and he fell for it). They started a trust together, and had purchased both the properties we'd looked at.

Guys... my heart is breaking. That happened a few years ago, and he just doesn't understand why it's wrong, and I can't put it into words in a way that he'll hear it. He says, 'it was only brief, you can't get hung up on something that was only an idea for a couple of weeks', but it's not really about that. It's about marriage, and committing yourself to another person, and I guess it's about the implicit - or explicit - promises we made to one another, regarding building a future together. I.e., him and me. Just him and me.

I can't compete with my MIL's money. We have a son. I hate my husband. I despise my MIL. Everytime the trust comes up,  my husband promises me that he is going to build a future with me, but here we are.... no trust of our own. No money left in his account, because it's all in theirs. No money in my account, because I'm a stay-at-home Mum with a 1yr old.

I'm fucked. I can't compete with this woman. She's won, and I've lost the man I love more than anyone in the world. And I have to make this choice about whether to stay and deal with this - which I can't, I just end up being resentful and hateful and treating my husband horrendously - or breaking our family apart, and trying to build my future again on my own.

The other things is... we totally could have done it together. I earned six figures before marriage and kids. I'm a driven, career woman, who loves her family and wanted to build a future with them. We totally could have made it.

My husband once said to me, 'I'm shooting for the stars with what I want to do with my life, and I want you right there beside me'. He spoke about our combined earning power. And then my MIL offered him all of her money, and he told me, 'She needs a champion. I want to champion her'.

But.... I needed him to champion me. And he still could have championed her, without giving my seat in the sidecar away.

So here we are, with a recent acknowledgment of more broken promises regarding a property we had just last week spoken about buying together (my husband and I). It would have been our first. By the end of the day we'd discussed it, he'd changed his mind. He would purchase it with my MIL.

And.... I'm out.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I just saw the dictionary at the side. This is straight up jocasta complex. I've actually spoken to my husband about how his MIL behaves towards him is the relationship she needs to be having with her husband...."
403,"I'm meeting my JNMIL today along with my DH in our first “group” counseling session, and technically my “follow-up” session, from meeting JNMIL nearly 3 months ago. The last thing my JNMIL said to me as she stormed out of the session early was: “I will stay out of yours and DH’s life!” That was 70 days ago.  


Within two days, she was back secretly texting and calling DH. DH was all too ready to excuse her lying and bizarre behavior, even going so far as saying “I know she feels really bad about what happened, but she probably hasn’t apologized to you because you’re really intimidating.” (Um, hardly. I've let her walk all over me for 2 years, so... funny how she's ""intimidated"" when I start calling out her bold face lies and inappropriate behaviors.)  


Fast forward a few weeks and I post about it here. The feedback really snapped me into the reality of the situation, which is that my DH is the real and more urgent problem. I should NEVER have gone to counseling with JNMIL on my own. That should have been DH’s job to protect me as his wife. Several wonderful, insightful people also asked why the hell would I agree to a follow up session with JNMIL. Especially after I confirmed with JNMIL on her way out that it did not matter if me and DH had children in the future, she was NOT willing to have a relationship with me.  


Welp. I'm pregnant. I ended up kicking my husband out of the house a month after that counseling session when he called me and said JNMIL had invited him (and only him) to her house for his birthday dinner and he was not only going, he would probably ”go ahead and tell her” I’m pregnant. After everything she’s done. After what she’s said to his wife. After explicitly excluding his wife...  I couldn’t see straight I was so mad. I told him to be gone by the week’s end. Since this isn’t JNSO, I’ll skip the part where he told me to “Get over it!” And that I should be thankful for my JNMIL, because a friend of his has in-laws that told him they hoped his babies died in the womb and he “*still* talks to them!!”  


Fast forward to this week. I’m preparing to file for divorce for a myriad of reasons that don’t belong in this sub. But, because I will be forced to consider custody with DH as soon as the birth... I also have to consider JNMIL’s access/relationship to my unborn child. Can you imagine the delight she will get when she hears she doesn’t have to abide by any healthy boundaries with me and can do whatever the hell she wants with my child because DH will be so helpless and looking for mommy’s help? I’m already sick over it. My counselor is willing to testify to JNMIL’s instability and irrationality... but really the court isn’t looking at anybody besides DH and I cannot control whom he takes my child around when he’s got her. (Even if I have Primary... he'd still have my little girl on weekends I'm guessing...)  


So while I initially had decided there was no way in hell I was going to give JNMIL a 6th or 7th chance to make amends in counseling and have a relationship with me... I’m in a tough spot. My counselor is aware of all the dynamics, and thinks JNMIL is batshit crazy...  but has suggested I come for this session tomorrow solely as a last attempt to hold her accountable for her actions in front of her son, who has not witnessed anything firsthand and goes by whatever mommy’s version is. As absurd as DH has been in this time, it is becoming obvious to me that he wants very much not to be around JNMIL, but cannot break out of his conditioned loyalty- even at the cost of his wife.   


I do have a surprise for them both though. I’m bringing my mother. And my mother is a bad ass who will sit there silently and just let them feel her presence. Her being there will help me, and hold JNMIL accountable outside those four walls afterward, I believe. So far, JNMIL has been able to twist the narrative a bit in her immediate circle.   


I guess I’m posting mostly for support- but if anyone has insight in regards to her rights/my rights to keeping her away from my child... Or even one-liners I can use in counseling, I’m all ears. I’m going to let the counselor steer the session, but I’m not holding back when it comes to bringing up every lie and manipulation (I have proof) and making sure everyone in the room hears what disgusting things she said to me in the last session. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - JNMIL goes 84 days without speaking to me, storms out of counseling. Another 70 days have gone by with no apology and DH sets up a second session where he will be in attendance. I'm surprising them both by bringing my mother. I feel this will help hold JNMIL accountable for every lie and disgusting thing she's said to me in private as well as keep her in check that everything will absolutely be exposed to the outside world and not kept hidden by DH."
404,"I posted a short rant about this right before my honeymoon. But I guess now I still can’t get this shit out of my head and want to rant. 

Absolutely loved my wedding, love my DH, had an absolute blast.

**BUT** 

My MIL wore a freaking white LACE dress to my damn wedding when I specifically asked her to wear grey or silver to compliment my JustYMom’s Mother of the Bride dress. I unfortunately (possibly fortunately) didn’t notice until after the ceremony when we were taking pictures. 

I instantly was no longer excited to take family pictures. Especially when the bitch made every fucking effort to stand her ass right the fuck next to me. 


[Her Standing Next To Me](https://imgur.com/a/DJU5x0F)

Her dress choice made my dress look yellow by comparison! I wanted to just skip photos entirely because of that shit. I verbally expressed anger and almost cried to my mother and photographer. I’m dreading seeing my photos from my photographer...


**Bonus: She wanted All of Me or Can’t Help Falling in Love as the mother son dance. We put our foot down on that**

My DH initially brushed off my complaints, said it “wasn’t that big of a deal” but when I consistently brought up how taboo it was and how mad I am, he finally apologized to me for her actions. He said he still doesn’t get why it’s that big of a deal but he gets that it upset and hurt me and he’s sorry for that.

I want to talk to her or want him to talk to her about it but idk how to go about it."
405,"Edit: I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for all of your comments, advice, and support. These past 6 months have been rough due to this situation and the support I’ve received from everyone here means so much.
—————————

There’s so much that’s happened between my MIL and I in the six months since my daughter was born that I would exceed the character limit tenfold if I explained it all. The TL;DR of it is for the 15 years (now 16) my husband and I have been married, MIL and I got along great; absolutely no issues whatsoever and I often said how grateful I was to have a MIL I got along so well with. My husband and I thought we couldn’t have kids but then right before our 15th anniversary we found out I was pregnant. MIL was still great towards me during the pregnancy, and was really excited when we found out we were having a girl (first granddaughter). However, in the 6 months since she’s been born MIL has done a complete 180 towards me. We’re now no longer speaking.

My theory is jealousy. About 4 months ago MIL and I had a huge blowout. She yelled and screamed at me called me a “fucking bitch;” accused me of stopping birth control and getting pregnant on purpose to trap my husband (all in front of my daughter). I’ve never taken birth control (can’t due to health reasons) and despite both my husband and I telling her this, she doesn’t believe it and insists I got pregnant maliciously. When my husband defended me, she said to him “you’re yelling at me over some woman, I’m your mother!” IMO, that comment gave away her jealousy.

My question is, why now? Why, after 16 years, is she acting this way towards me now? Was the baby the trigger? She’s done some things regarding my daughter that I don’t like; referring to her as “my baby” (even “my daughter” a few times), has criticized my parenting, and has even tried to forcefully remove my daughter from my arms so she could hold her during the baby’s first big family picture at a family event last month. (She’s done so much more, but these examples will give you an idea of how she’s been acting as far as the baby is concerned).

I would’ve thought that if she were going to start acting like so many other hateful/jealous MILs, it would’ve started years ago. If my theory that the baby was the trigger is correct, does anyone know why?"
406,"Yes. That is the call we got last night. 

She has yet to apologise for her behaviour, though her mother did have a whole bunch of words with her about how awful she is to DP and I. We haven't spoken to her in over a week. The gifts and things stopped, and all the nasty messages. I do suspect she has told the simpering sycophants that I have miscarried, but to be honest I really don't care, because when we do have children not one of her so called best friends will ever be meeting them, at any point. To those who commented on my last post, thank you for the kind words in a difficult moment - it reinforced how not okay Pandora was in her actions to DP when he showed signs of wavering the day after I posted when she called to discuss the ""wedding"" There will be another post on that, once I have picked through the crazy number of posts she has made. But lets get back on subject.

Pandora video called DP last night. Not to apologise, but to ask when he is working over the weekend because she wants to come and visit him. He is working most of Friday from lunch time until around 11pm. He is off on Saturday. He tells her this expecting her to demand a portion of our already planned out Saturday, but no, she declares that she will see him on Friday. DP is confused, because how can she come to our house to see us and apologise if he is at work, so tells her so. Pandora has no intention of coming to our house and apologising. 

When she says she wants to visit him, she doesn't actually mean she wants to visit him, and she certainly doesn't want to visit with me. By visit him, she means she is going out with SSIL and a few of the sycophants. And what does this have to do with DP working? Well DP works for a chain of gastropubs. He gets a pretty decent staff discount at the pubs in the chain, which does include alcohol, unlike many other similar places. The terms of it mean that he can use it for family/friends but he has to be the one to physically pay for the transaction. 

So when Pandora says she wants to visit him, the reality is that Pandora and her pals want to come and abuse his staff discount, while he is on shift so she doesn't actually have to spend any time with him. 

Jokes on them though, because DP is working in the kitchen tomorrow."
407,"JNMIL refuses to acknowledge she screwed up and is blaming everything on DH and assumingly me, but who cares about me. I’m pissed for DH. Last I checked in, DH has been ignoring JNMIL because she ghosted him on a conversation about boundaries and DH took that as her answer of “you’re not important enough” and stopped contacting her. MIL has been frequently calling and texting DH. Between DH just straight up ignoring her and being busy at work, he obviously has not reciprocated. 

JNMIL sent a dramatic as hell text message last night asking DH if she needed to mourn the loss of her son (She could win a drama pageant). Then today, DH gets a text from a random number “are you ignoring your mom?” I have a stinking feeling I know exactly who the random number is and it’s JNMIL #1 FM. Who we are also pissed at for getting in the middle of a situation that has absolutely nothing to do with her over the last year and a half or so. So we know JNMIL has been complaining to whoever will listen to her bullshit. Which is not unusual because it’s always woe is me with MIL. 

JNMIL will do anything to deflect and gaslight any blame on any situation. No one has ever made MIL own up to her shit... except DH and I. She likes to wait a little bit and then blow up your phone like nothing ever happened, praying on magical memory loss that she’s in the clear and gods gift to the world again. Not so fast MIL. DH and I refuse to put up with her shit. DH plans on calling her today/tomorrow to put the situation to bed because he’s over it. 

I’ve never seen DH get quite as pissed/annoyed as I have these last few months with MIL. It’s disheartening to say the least. Sometimes I wish MIL would just disappear off the face of the earth, but I do not wish that pain upon my husband. Even if she is a piece of work, I know DH would be heartbroken if she was no longer around, even as subconsciously as she is now."
408,"(Warning: Graphic Language/Username)

Hey Fam, we have a fresh story to ruminate on this morning. DH and BIL2 (19YO and lives at home) are close and since he graduated, we have been on the phone weekly with him to talk about his plans and dreams now that he is out of high school. This kid is a cross between a son and a brother for DH because of the crazy age difference and they fact that DH has been the only really stable adult in his life since day one. I’m also close to BIL2 and would do anything for that guy. He has been given almost no direction from his parents (even though they pushed college for the first two) and as such, he did not plan for anything after graduation and is currently hopping around low paid jobs trying to save up enough money to move to the West Coast to be with his GF.

 

Now most of you have already picked up on the fact that BIGGERMIL has some seriously outdated gender norms and she loves to insert herself into any situation like an antibiotic resistant cough. I think she (subconsciously) grooms all of her boys to be completely dependent on her in order to secure a place of importance and control in their lives. None of her other kids filled out their own financial packets for college, none of them filed their own taxes, no one outside of BIGGERMIL schedules their own doctors’ appointments- she takes care of it all. She doesn’t do any of these tasks well, but it allows her access to all of their information and she gets a say in all important decisions. This has financially f****ed us several times because of “advise” this woman gave to DH before he moved in with me.

 

So when DH and BIL2 were talking, we discovered that BIGGERMIL has been nagging BIL2 about how much money he spends. As in, she checked the bank account and keeps tabs on her 19YO son’s spending habits and then questions him about it. Does BIL2 have wildly bad spending habits? Is this 19YO in serious debit? Is there a secret drug or gambling habit that could cause concern or worry? LOL, this is BIGGERMIL. She has never helped anyone with a drug or gambling habit and she often enables FILs nightly binge drinking, she just likes to meddle. The *concern* she has is a once a year payment from an account called PUSSYDESTROYER****69 for $100 then a series of $25 deposits.

 

Y’all. This is the venmo account BIL2 set up for the sole purpose of participating in DH’s fantasy football league each year. The buy-in is unnecessarily high, but there are a series of payouts for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place with around 12 members participating. If any of you know anything about fantasy football, you generally get to pick a “team name” and since our league is a series of life long bro family and friends- the names are graphic and wildly inappropriate. The venmos are also graphic and wildly inappropriate. The $25 dollars are occasionally sent from us to BIL2 because his life is rough and we love him. An unexpected $25 to a broke ass 19YO is way more appreciated than you might realize.

 

BIL2 will not, and has not, told BIGGERMIL any of this. He just changes the subject and lets her spiral into worry. Which serves her right TBH. This has been going on for a few weeks now with BIGGERMIL nagging poor BIL2 about this payment/deposits from PUSSYDESTROYER****69 and him deferring her questions. I can only imagine what she’s been spreading to friends and family (because what is the point of meddling if you can’t gossip about it).

 

My main issue is WHY DOES BIGGERMIL HAVE ACCESS TO HIS ACCOUNT???

 

Well, BIGGERMIL convinced BIL2 a while ago in his teens that he doesn’t really need a bank account so he should just use hers. You know, because its soooooooo hard to open a bank account and it would be a *pain* to transfer money from her account into his *should she ever need too*. And yes, I imagine he’s been depositing his paychecks and essentially his dreams into her account with all the innocence of a lamb going to the slaughter.

 

Yes, we are shutting that sh*t down hard. But I’m now forever TEAM PUSSYDESTROYER.

 






 

SIDE NOTE ABOUT RESIDUAL GUILT/NOT A PART OF BIGGER SHENANIGANS:

 

So, as anyone who has done a basic drive by of my account would realize, this is not a very anonymous profile. Last night it hit me- what if BIGGERMIL finds this account and reads all of these stories? What will the rest of the family think? Am I hurting DH by posting all of her nastiness?

 

In all fairness, I don’t care about her feelings, reputation or our (BIGGERMIL vs. OP) relationship. Honestly, I take solace in the fact that I fully plan on outliving her. She is the worst and between her meddling and her lifestyle, I genuinely stress about the day DH and I have babies and her inevitable attempts to be in their lives and any influence that may smear off on them. I have found that if I don’t share her nonsense, it sits in my heart and corrodes my thoughts and feelings. I joke in a lot of these stories, but I’ve never dealt with a woman this stupid, self-centered and manipulative before. Before JUSTNO, I felt like my world view that “Everyone has some good in them” had been violently ripped away with the evolution of BIGGERMIL. This sub has taught me that these MIL incidents are not something that I should take seriously and that the less time I spend ruminating on her shocking lack of common decency, the more peace I will have. I’m essentially journaling these stories as a sort of therapy while I deal with navigating bigger issues with DHs whole family. DH said he doesn’t like it, but he also doesn’t want to hear about it. Our version of Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell.

 

So thank you all. This sub is significantly less than therapy and if you can get a laugh from it, then maybe we can counteract just a little of her negativity in this world."
409,"Aaannnnndddd I'm back. I knew she wouldn't last long. But boy did me and D(ear)H enjoy the quiet while it lasted. 

First off, I re-read our message that we had sent to her ([https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dg863m/update\_well\_it\_wont\_be\_your\_will\_but\_itll\_be\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dg863m/update_well_it_wont_be_your_will_but_itll_be_his/)). I realized just how firm, reasonable, and *nice* our message was. It was essentially us saying, ""Hey, you're making us comfortable. You're not allowed to pressure us about kids anymore"". That's it. Truly, any JustYes person would've received this message well. 

But unfortunately, my MIL has really shown herself to be a big ol' JustNo. 

So last night around 9, me and DH we're watching a movie and relaxing in bed when DH got a text. I figured his best friend was texting him back about the internet troubles we've been having when I heard, ""oh shit, my mom actually texted back"". 

Here's what she sent us (my thoughts in italics). I left any grammatical mistakes as is:

""(DH), I wish you would have talked to instead of a text (*Why? So you could try to rugsweep or write off your 'jokes'?).* I'm sorry that you took it as intrusive (*And I'm sorry you don't have the emotional/mental maturity to deal with basic boundaries. See? We can both make non-apologies).* It is tough being a parent. Children can be a joy and a heartache (*LMFAO!!!!! Us telling you to stop pressuring us for children is bringing you heartache?! Better get used to heartache since we plan to continue setting boundaries! ALSO, WE ARE NOT CHILDREN ANYMORE. Apparently, we're adult enough to have kids, but not adult enough to call you on your bullshit?!! Get that patronizing bull outta here).* I will never bring it up again"" (*Reading comprehension, lady, do you have it?! We merely told you to stop pressuring us to have kids, in passing conversations or in jokes, NOT that we could never talk about babies in general).* 

Any questions I had about if I *really* had a JNMIL (compared to others I read about) on my hands have been answered. I was extremely upset with her last call but was willing to start fresh if she could answer our text in a JY way. NOPE. She's shown her colors and as many in this group say, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. 

Part of me really wants to call her up and hash it out. Really **make** her understand that yes, it is in fact extremely intrusive to pressure a couple to have kids literally every single time we talk and no, it's not just me and DH that think that. I want her to just learn the lesson that the rest of us learned, that words have meaning and impact. That you can't just spew out any thought that enters your mind. I want her to understand how truly disgusting her previous comments were. I just want her to grow up; act like a goddamn 62 year old who was taught even an iota of class or tact. 

Also, when I'm not completely frustrated by her complete lack of awareness, I can't help but laugh about all of this either. She sat on our message for a full week and then sent us this drivel? LOL I feel like Gandalf, ""Your guilt trips have no power here!"" haha Her attempts to victimize herself in this situation are so incredibly laughable to me. She made offensive jokes and expects me to feel sorry for her????? I'm too out of shape for those mental gymnastics lol   


Overall, the smart part of me knows that saying/doing any of the above would be futile and would just go in one ear and out the other. This side of me knows we should just ignore all her dramatics and text back, ""Thanks for understanding"". Me and DH still need to have a discussion on her message since we didn't get a chance to last night or this morning. 

But I'd like to know what you all think about her response and about what we should respond with.You all have been so supportive and always manage to point out things that neither of us notice. Thanks to everyone who's helped us so far and continues to do so!

(Also, I apologize for how long and/or ranty this got. I really needed to vent all my frustrations out!)"
410,"This is long, but I'm hoping a few if you will be willing to advise me on how to communicate to my husband that his MIL is just intentionally hurting him and that it's not my fault for being angry about it.

My SO typically has a handle on my MIL, but something happened today that really disturbed me. 

The three of us met up for lunch. Lately my FIL (divorced MIL years ago) has been a topic of concern. He's ill, lost weight, seems to be losing memory. He's become an alcoholic again after a 30 year break, but seems like dementia is starting too. 

I suppose MIL doesn't like that he's the center of attention right now. She didn't even order before she started launching into a tale about how she's going to AA meetings (it's where they met) and ""talking about it"" despite not drinking herself and not living with him or even regularly seeing him. And ""dealing with her trauma of finding out her dad isn't her dad"" (at 9, she is now in her 50s, the father who raised her is really nice). As a funny aside, she was angry at the waitress for ""interrupting our private conversation"" by asking us if we want to order! 

That's all annoying, but run of the mill. But then, my husband opened up a bit. He said he misses the person his dad was in his childhood, before he became an alcoholic again. MIL twisted the knife. She told my husband that his dad was actually an alcoholic way before now, into his childhood, while they lived in his childhood home. 

My husband gently pushed back on that idea. She must be mistaken, she's thinking of the wrong house, etc. 

She insists and I get visibly upset. I'm not the type to hold my tongue, but I've found my husband does a better job of pushing back than I do. So, I leave for the bathroom. As I stand up, MIL ""I'm only telling you that your dad was an alcoholic in your childhood so you realize alcoholism is a progressive disease."" 

Thank God I was already on my way. When I come back she's already doing her typical bullshit of inflating his ego. We head to pay. As we're leaving she throws a gab at her scapegoat ""your sister wears her past like a badge."" 

""What?"" I say. It's wrong, but I start setting a trap to catch her in. Pretty sure she was doing that all lunch and it'd be nice to call her in it. 

Husband says he'll ""explain what she means"" later and we leave. In the car, he starts to explain it to me, which is also sadly naive, so I explain that I knew and was close to calling her in her behavior. 

He disagrees that's what she was doing. He disagrees that she's intentionally lying about his dad being an alcoholic earlier. Just accidentally lying I guess? I express that I'm furious.

And then he says that I don't need to be mad on his behalf. 

How can I not be? And if she did this to my child, I would rip her head off. So I feel like it's important he really gets it before that. He *usually* gets it, I think his dad is just too much of a soft spot."
411,"While I am still waiting for DH to talk to his parents about paying us back and the ring issue, I though I would share a minor success. 

So on top of all the issues with my MIL, she has had baby rabies since DH and I were married. She made it very well known that she wants grandchildren. Now, DH and I want children, however, we are waiting for a few years due to careers and whatnot. We are both 25, so we have plenty of time to have children in the future. Keep in mind MIL does already have two grandchildren. They live in a different state and MIL wants grandchildren close to her as she assumes she will get to see them everyday. Unfortunately (for me), we live 5 minutes away from her as I bought my house before I meet DH. 

Not only was MIL making comments every time she saw me about babies, she was pressuring DH whenever he would see her on his own. At first it didn't really bug me, however, over time I couldn't take the constant pressure anymore. We will have children when we are ready, not a minute sooner. 

So probably like 6 months ago, MIL brought it up again. I told her that it probably wouldn't be for at least 5 years and she literally started CRYING in a bar. I took it as a success because she didn't say anything for a while. 

I had the misfortune of seeing her two days ago as she showed up at GMIL's. DH was helping GMIL put on shoes and she made a comment ""Don't you want to have babies with him?"" but she said it sarcastically. Without hesitation I responded a simple ""No."" She then started back-peddling that DH would be a good dad. 

Jokes on her, when we do have children she's only going to see them for holidays anyways."
412,"First time posting here, so I already apologize.

Setting the scene:
My wedding is coming up in a few weeks. When invitations went out my FBIL was not dating anyone and so he was not given a plus one. About four months ago he got himself a GF. They live in another state and said GF has not met any of the family. FBIL wanted to bring his GF to the wedding and rehearsal and straight up threatened not to come if she couldn’t come. I personally didn’t want her there because I didn’t think it was an appropriate place for her to meet the family since it’s OUR big day and I worried about her stealing the attention (petty I know). I conceded to her coming because I didn’t want to cause drama. 

Enter FMIL: my SO was talking to his M, and she made a comment about how excited she was to be “sitting next to FBIL’s GF because she looks at her as her next DIL” ....at our wedding where she is actually getting a new DIL. 

I know I’m probably over reacting but this comment made me irrationally made because I think it proves that my reasoning for not wanting her there was justified."
413,"Might be triggering 

So this story starts from when I first got pregnant. I’m now 7 months and my baby is still healthy. 
 
My mother has always blamed her failed life on me and my siblings. So When she got with her bf it was all about him and his kids and I didn’t really care I was used to neglect from her. That was until I got pregnant she suddenly started asking all of these questions about my baby and at first I was like ok she just is excited to have a grand baby. 

(Me and my husband were not married at this point in time and he was 18 and I was 17 so we weren’t really expecting a kid but we love her anyway.)  

At the beginning of the pregnancy I got horrible morning sickness and my mother gave me these pills that she “swore” the doctor said was safe for me to take I couldn’t keep anything down so I didn’t take them regularly in fact barely ever took them. 

(The pills she gave me were not supposed to be consumed by anyone pregnant or nursing because it contains harmful stuff in it that can cause the baby to die. )
I didn’t find this out until after me and my husband had moved in with his parents who are lovely people and asked me what I was taking. Being neglected my entire life I didn’t know a lot of basic things like when you are pregnant the doctor prescribes you prenatal vitamins. So when me and mil look at my pills that I still haven’t token regularly we see that I’m not supposed to take them and then we looked up the results of what can happen... I could’ve had a miscarriage or worse and now I refuse to talk to my mother because what kind of sick bitch does something like that. I 100% want my baby and am exited for her to be born. No matter your views on teen pregnancy it’s my choice what to do with my kid.  And she’s crying about how she didn’t mean too and how I’ll be better off waiting to have a child and I could always have more ect. Needless to say my kid is only having one grandma and grandpa. Thank god my husbands parents are normal ass people who are just as excited as we are about the baby"
414,"I am so glad I found this place. Finally I don't feel like I am alone, however, I'm also really worried about how many crazy MIL's there are in the world!

This may be a long one because it is super fresh and I am beyond angry, so here goes...

My SO and I will be having a baby, it is both of our first and due it April 2020. We don't live together and both are with our moms for various reasons. The idea has been, even before I got knocked up, to move in together however we need to move JNMIL out to her own place. I just hands-down refuse to live with her in my space (it's not her house btw, she lost her house to the bank). 

JNMIL has been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Narcissistic personality disorder ( Sothe typical stuff applies here, talks about herself, how he met a prince once etc, how I'm not good enough, manipulates, emotionally blackmails her sons, throws kicking screaming temper tantrums and tells my SO how much she hates him when she doesn't get her way.) and can literally not talk about anything but herself, but wait it gets so much worse. She was an alcoholic and had a stoke? No one really knows and she lost all ability to talk. Does she try to talk, oh hell yes, but it comes out as raspy grunts that are unintelligible. She also does not get out of bed. I'm not exaggerating, she does not leave her bed. She sits there and smokes packs of the cheapest cigarettes in the dark while watching rerun after rerun of old '80s sitcoms on VHS. All of this is her choice. There are beautiful gardens outside, a big pool, Netflix even... We pay for everything; the rent the food, utilities, doctors...

Anyway, in the beginning, I would sit in her smoke-filled room and try to guess what she was saying, SO would translate if possible but that ship has sailed, I have long ago written her off and I literally do not even greet her or acknowledge her presence. That is what is best for me. Now, the fing problem.

SO wants me to mend the relationship with this person so she can have a relationship with my child ( I say my child here because I get so possessive about the idea of the woman touching this life I am creating). Not only must I fix the relationship but I must respect her. If I don't respect her I am disrespecting him. I said that isn't even logical and I cannot just respect someone that has literally done nothing in the last 7 years. Respect is earned not given. Also, there is no way in hell that I am letting her have a relationship with my child because you can bet she's not going to suddenly go for wonderful walks in the park or do anything that is beneficial to the child's life. She will sit there and expect me to take my child into that smoke-filled room and put her on the bed or in her arms and sit there while she grunts at me. Am I the only one who thinks that is absolutely abhorrent!! 

I am upset obviously, I cried myself into a migraine yesterday, and mostly very sad. I wanted a little family with my SO, but I would rather stay where I am, safe at my mommy in a clean big house where that creature can't ever touch my baby."
415,"FIL is being moved from this second hospital slash rehab facility (1hr from our house) to a third one that’s more in-depth for his brain injury about 2.5 hours from our house on a good day.  This was told to us on Monday—and by “told,” I mean that I spotted it by accident on the public FB page that MIL updates with FIL’s condition vs. us actually being told any firsthand information about how his GD FATHER is doing. 

Yesterday FH and I started getting messages from multiple friends and family members: “is MIL okay? Is something going on? Are she and FIL I’m some sort of danger?”

Upon investigation, we discovered that she had updated the page with the following: “yes FIL is being moved to a new rehab facility, but please stop asking us where. This is for his and my safety and protection.” 

FH and his sister are both officially baffled. We have no idea what she thinks is going on and why she thinks they need “protection.” 

Add this to the whole “just let me raise your daughter” mess (along with a couple other recent tirades that honestly just need their own posts) and we are starting to have real genuine concerns about her mental state right now."
416,"TW: small amount of death

So I touched on this in a previous post, this is the freshest load of bullshit I have recieved for JNMIL so its wedged right in my lobe.

After a particularly long conversation with SO, the subject of grandchildren came up, AGAIN! SO tactfully shut it down but I feel it's just not finite enough for me. A few issues have been grating on me ever since and they are:

1) This is a serious discussion that we as a couple should be having and where I believe grandparents are so important (I was raised by mine) I also believe that she doesn't really get to have a say in how we live our lives (but my goodness does she ever try)

2) She believes our age will play a big factor in us having children, I'm 27 and SO is 32, she seems to conveniently forget that both she and JYFIL were similar in age when SO was born.

3)We arent even 100% sure that we actually want children! SO leans to JN a good deal of the time, I have an occasional JY moment but very rarely, maybe I should get a Sphynx and forgo the kids?

And the cherry on this specific shit cake is:

4) SHE ALREADY HAS GRANDCHILDREN!!!!

Now I will concede that she doesn't see them, but that is her choice, she blames SILs SO for SILs short illness that lead to her passing away. My heart hurts for those children and the family to lose someone so quickly at such a young age, but this feels like shes punishing her grandchildren for the mistakes of their father. It would literally take a phone call for her to see those kids again (even though the youngest wouldnt know who she is) it's never too late to try to build bridges.

My point in all of this is that I resent being treated like I'm just a walking gestation sac when it's me and SO who would have to deal with raising a child, me who would have to carry said child and me who would have to put up with more of JNMILs bullshit....at least the record would be changed to babies instead of how slovenly we live.

Maybe I should just get a damn cat...."
417,"This is an old memory that popped up. Just shows some of the fucked up shit my mom has done. 

A little background on this. 

My well I guess she's my half JNSister is a compulsive liar. This is important. She would do whatever it took to get the attention on her. Including accusing my father, her adopted dad, of sexually abusing her. He was convicted of it and spent six months in jail. He served his time. My father is the greatest man I've ever met. 

Skip ahead, my sister yet again needs the attention in her. Her freshman year my sister did it yet again, she told everyone my dad beat her because of a bruise on her hip that I know SPECIFICALLY that she got from hip checking out table. Anyway, she got put in foster care. We later found out she lied about everything. 

Skip ahead more, my parents are on verge of divorce. My mom and I got into a screaming fight, and she screams at me ""YOU'RE THE REASON YOUR FATHER AND I ARE DIVORCING, YOU ARE PRETTIER AND BETTER THAN YOUR SISTER AND THAT'S WHY HE CHEATED ON ME WITH YOUR SISTER"" Y'all what? 

She literally blamed me for my dad WHICH WAS A LIE for ""cheating"" on her. WHEN SHE WAS CHEATING ON MY DAD THREE YEARS BEFORE THEIR DAMN DIVORCE. 

Honestly I think she's always been jealous of me.. but that makes me sound conceited so I don't like thinking like that. 

I'm so fucked up mentally and emotionally from this women."
418,"I have posted here before about feeling annoyed about my mother in law. I am not able to get over the fact that she has not texted or called me once to ask how I am doing after my moms passing close to a year ago now. So here’s the new stuff. It’s my husbands birthday and he is into bowling and needed new shoes so I told him today I would like to take him out for bowling shoes shopping. He then mentioned to me that his mother is giving him shoes and new bowling ball. He said “ Did you cross check with my mom?” I told him ok  I will give him something else then. I feel so hurt about this. I had planned to give him shoes for a while now. Am I supposed to check with her or is she supposed to check with me? I am just going through so many emotions right now as I am typing this sitting in my car- the loss of my mom, feeling lonely, feeling violated in some way. MIL and her husband are coming over for my husbands birthday and I am dreading it. How should I handle this? Why do I feel so hurt?"
419,"MIL has shown her ass to majority of our wedding guests and I’m pretty damn happy about it. So many people thought I was exaggerating, but once they had the pleasure of meeting her, it took around 5 seconds for them to realise how crazy and energy sapping she really is. 

Some stuff she did:

• Rocked up Thursday to hlep with wedding stuff. Made herself out to be a saint at the fact she was there to help and that we should be HONOURED she was there (in reality, FIL dragged her there earlier than she wanted to be there, as he *actually* wanted to help) 

• We went out for tea Thursday night with DH’s JustYES aunt, uncle, dad and JNOMIL. The idea was to catch up with aunt/uncle as we don’t see them often. MIL proceeded railroad the entire conversation, for the entire night. Didn’t get to catch up with them at all. 

• Made me out to be a bridezilla in front of anyone who would listen (I’ve actually been incredibly chill about the entire wedding, I have to say) because I reminded DH of a small job that needed to be done. 
 
• At dinner, brought up what we were doing for Christmas and turned into a desperate harpy, carrying on about “Any day can be Christmas just comeeeeee visit us pleaseeeee” to the point everyone at the table felt incredibly awkward. She then leaned across the table, grabbed my hands, stared me in the eyes and begged me to come to see them at some point in December. Awkward. 

• Got mad when I was prepping/packing stuff for the wedding - the DAY before the wedding - and not giving her my full attention and eye contact whilst she talked about herself endlessly. 

• Asked for a job during set-up, so I told her to place all our favours (mini succulents) on the favour table. Apparently this was too hard for her to do without spilling some. She spent the next 20 minutes loudly bitching about how shit of an idea it was to have succulents, how fiddly they are and why did we bother having them, blah blah. One of my bridesmaids promptly told her to shut the fuck up. 

• Did not smile at all during the ceremony or reception. Glared at me the entire time. 

• At one point during the reception, she sat at her table, put her head in her hands and proceeded to cry. Loudly. Don’t know what that was about. Then proceeded to bitch to others on her table. 

• At one point during the reception, someone yelled out to me “Hey MRS (DH last name!!)” to which MIL yelled back, “Hey, I’m ALSO a Mrs (DH last name)! What about me?!”

• Flashed the fact she had “allergies” in front of anyone who would listen. Ate many, many foods that she is apparently “allergic” to. Also in front of everyone. 

• Got incredibly jealous at the fact I had more attention (you know, on my wedding day) than she did. 

My bridesmaids were on MIL-watch that night, I’m sure I’ll hear many more stories of her bitching about me after we get back from the honeymoon. At least my friends/extended family can understand why I don’t want to be around her now."
420,"Fmil took me for ice cream and referred to me as a good child who should stay in a child's place. (this is seriously just /s I'm teasing lol got ya.. ) 

This is long af and I'm writing on my phone after smoking a ton of weed again.

 I just wanted to start out by saying my DD who's 7 spends tons of time with the crazy criminal (fitting name for fmil) DD says Fmil always says nice things about me to her, literally after every visit DD says Fmil was complimenting me on everything down to my makeup and what I wore that day to saying her mommy is an amazing strong woman who's smart and just so so amazing, but she has never said a single nice or kind thing to me or in front of me. She's usually civil not mean or harsh but not nice. The only compliments I usually get to my face are about my parenting and how I raised DD to be so amazing and how I trained DD to shoot rainbows from her ass. 

Fmil took me for ice cream and we had a nice talk. You should know Fmil loves her some junk food, but only 3 times per week on dialysis days. I obviously expected her to be MEAN because she's always unstable and full of rage after dialysis but nope she was just kind and happy, almost like a child just excited to get her ice cream. It's the first time she's ever opened up to me. I've been with SO for almost 3 years, almost 4 including the year we were broken up but he was Coparenting my DD7 with me. Fmil behaves civilly but while she's kind to my DD and loves her, she's never been what one would consider ""nice"" to me unless she's sorry she was mean. The last time I saw her she didn't actually speak to me, she literally growled at me and said goodbye because she was angry I caught her being nice and playing with my DD. 

FMIL likes to make the outside world see her as a mean evil person. Not in the you kids get off my darn lawn sense, but the I can order you to be kidnapped and tortured this moment sense. She can't stand people seeing her be nice so she does it secretly behind our back, it's usually her grandkids or my DD who tell Fdh and I about her doing nice or kind things for people. A good reference is her inviting my DD to go to a book Fair at a school an hour away, I was a little confused why but I said sure go and have fun. She gets home and tells me that they gave Fmil an award and kept wanting to take photos of her. Why you may ask, because she paid to buy every student a chromebook and got the school Internet for 2 years. THEY NAMED THE LIBRARY AFTER HER. I though DD was confused untill I googled the school a few weeks later and the school paper had a photo of DD and Fmil in it. Never heard a word about this from MIL. I tried to bring it up by saying I was confused by what DD told us, Fmil lied and said she donated $50 and that's why they took her photo. 

Another time she had DD at her office with the other grandkids. By the time I get there Fmil has a permanent scowl on her face and is making the children sit in total silence while lecturing them about something. I asked her if DD was misbehaving and Fmil said no not at all. I'm a bit angry so I leave right away. In the car on the way home DD tells me that they were having fun and playing with Legos and playing hide and seek but Fmil told DD to tell me Fmil was mean that day. DD also told me that Fmil saw me enter the building on the security camera and had all the kids play a game. She taught them this ""game"" when all the parents left. The game was basically for all the kids to look sad and sit quietly when she knew the parents were there to pick them up. DD went on for hours about how much fun they had and how Fmil had a million Legos in her office and Fmil would play any game they wanted and had fun with them. 

So on to Wednesdays ice cream. Fmil actually smiled in front of just me for the first time. Usually she reserves the smile for DD. She told me she's glad I met Fdh and she wouldn't want or allow him with anyone else. (when we broke up for a year she physically attacked his new GF with a baseball bat for knocking over her favorite bamboo plant) She had to throw in the allow part and that made me think of that incident. FMIL complimented my personality, my beauty, my intelligence, and my parenting. It was the first time she's complimenting anything but my parenting. Normally any praise she gives me is reserved for DD and how amazing DD is and how I did a good job raising her. She thinks DD has a rainbow coming out of her butt and I was just her incubator. We went to my drug dealer together because she wanted what she called ""good weed"" , in the car she was telling me that she was proud of me and how it must have been hard as a single mother with no family or in-laws to help she said how even if I ever left Fdh she would always be around to help me (she had already made it clear if I left Fdh DD was staying in her family even if she had to force me physically). How she was so glad she got to meet me way back when and that I was the perfect DIL. I was actually in shock, it's the first and only time I get a compliment and once she started she just couldn't stop. When I dropped her back at the ice cream place so her driver could take her to her office she complimented my weed and thanked me for the hook up. The woman never says thank you unless it's her kids, grandkids, or service staff. 

I'm confused, I don't know what to think and I'm legitimately concerned she's had a stroke. After I got home I forced Fdh to go check on her and demanded he check her blood pressure, I also made him secretly count all her pain pills and Xanax because I was concerned she was high af. Nope, no drug binge and no stroke. He did it in a way so it didn't look like he was worried because she was being nice that day. 

This is the woman who made my DD pretend that she's been yelling and screaming and that's why DD was upset at her when I show up. Nope she bribed DD with candy to tell me she was mean the first time they met. FMIL seriously can't handle people knowing the truth about her, and the truth is that while she's a JN in her own right she actually is a nice person. Sure she threatened to kidnap my child. Went to jail for 2 years for attempting to murder someone by hiring a hit man. Broke some guys hand with a wrench over $42 last month etc etc. She even openly admits to being married 12 times and scamming 11 of the men out of every penny they had. Fdh did tell me that his mother wasn't how she seems. He would laugh at me when I would complain she was mean in the beginning. The only reason I willingly spend any time with her and didn't get Fdh to move across the country is because she loves my DD and treats her equally to her other grandkids. I was always so confused about why I'd get DD from her house when she babysat but DD would be sitting there on the verge of crying only to start telling me how much fun they had that day when we got in the car. My DD describes her as Gru from despicable me. DD says she doesn't like being seen as a nice person because she's secretly a super villan and is plotting to take over the world and even promised that DD would become president of iceland when it happened, she also told DD that iceland would own Brazil like America owns Puerto Rico. This woman has a notebook titled ""evil plans to take over the world""  that she keeps locked in her safe at work.  I'm just still so shocked she can be nice TO ME. I really thought she didn't like me and only tolerated me because that's how she got to keep DD around. 

Don't get me wrong she's done JN stuff like telling me (dictating to me) DD was a member of her family the first time she met DD after my 3rd date with Fdh (his first time spending an extended length of time with DD)  and her sending some men to tell my ex bf (Fdh and I broke up for a year but he coparented DD with me) she'd have him kidnapped and dissolved in acid if he didn't kick rocks and go away because my DD didn't like him. She even had an investigator follow and photograph me for 5 months when I broke up with Fdh. I do give credit where it's due for her accepting DD unlike the mother/wife horror stories I've read about here. She gives my Fdh space and doesn't get into out relationship unless we need advice, she doesn't depend on Fdh. She also loves DD and made it her mission to put my abusive ex husband and ex MIL in their places. Best of all is that she respects my day to day parenting boundaries and even enforces them with other people, everything from not too much candy to iPad time and bedtime. That's really the only things I think she's ever respected to be honest.
 DD says Fmil always says nice things about me when I'm not around but this is the first time I've heard them directly."
421,"Okay, so FDH and I have been doing really bad financially. He got fired from his job a couple months ago, going on three, and even though he's had a couple interviews, nothing has come of it. Then his lymph node under his chin swelled up badly; for any redditors that are medically inclined, I believe their medical names are submental lymph nodes.

He wasn't showing any symptoms or anything, but this lump was very painful. It got to where it hurt to talk and eat. Since his brother and SIL owe us a lot of money (FBIL racked up thousands of dollars in debt on multiple credit cards they were cosigned on and left FDH holding the bills) and we can't afford a doctor, I figured I'd reach out to them for the money to take FDH to a clinic. We would count it against the debt they owe us and when we looked it up, we found that the swelling could last for weeks; I couldn't bear the thought of him being in that much pain for that long so I reached out. They said they'd send the money as soon as possible and FBIL even called; the brothers had a lengthy catch uo conversation which was the first time they had talked since the debt came to light.

A day or two passed and the first floor of our townhome apartment flooded. The company tasled with getting as much water out of the floor as possible said their was more than 70 gallons in our floor. While there was little damage thanks to us discovering the flood early on, it was very stressful and exhausting. While the work was being done, FMIL called us, breaking her self-imposed NC. Apparently, FBIL had called her.

FBIL and FSIL had told her that I was going around asking for money, that FDH was sick (they made it sound worse than it was), and that I claimed FMIL had ""viciously attacked"" me. I did not; what I had done was tell FSIL that she had *verbally* attacked me when we tried to get our own phone bill. This is not the first time they've twisted my words to a degree where it's basically a lie.

Now we get to the reason for this post... Overbearing FMIL... When she called, she expressed concern and worry. She semt him $300 to help us out. She also pressured him about finding a job and working hard to get one, contacting temp agencies, and repeatedly saying that she didn't raise him to be a bum. She made it sound like he had been sitting on his ass after getting fired! She did this over and over and over and I could see FDH getting more and more frustrated each time. She even demanded that he dress up in his best interview outfit and send her a picture. Apprently, she ""needs to make sure he's not looking crazy or he won't get hired"". She also pressured him multiple times to get his hair cut super short, almost bald. He hates having his hair like that.

FDH had to look up something and used that as an excuse to get off the phone. As soon as he hung up the phone, he screamed, loudly, in pure frustration at her inabilty to listen and treat him like an adult that knows how to take care of himself. When he called her back, she started harping on the same shit she had already harped on three or four times in less than twenty minutes! I can tell FDH is getting infuriated so I speak up. I tell her that he's been working to find a job; hell, he's been working himself to the bone to find one. The phone call ended shortly thereafter when she mentioned me ""eavesdropping"" on their phone call. I wasn't, she's just so loud on the phone that I could hear almost every other word she said. She paid no credence to me sticking up for him, himself saying multiple times how hard he was working, or the amount of anger and frustration in his voice you'd have to willfully ignore to not hear.

Does anyone else have a MIL that insists on almost forcibly holding their adult child's hand or so painfully ignores what anyone tries to say? How do you deal with them?"
422,"On mobile. So, I’m not sure if the situation with my in laws has hit an all time high or an all time low. Things with the in laws have never been worse but my husband and I have never stood stronger as a united front. 

Recap: My MIL, SIL, and our nieces were going to come stay at our home for a “long weekend”, arrive on Thursday, leave Sunday. DH had scheduled to be off of work on Thursday and Friday so that I would not be a hostage in my own home with my in laws who tend to be unpleasant. SIL could no longer come on the scheduled weekend and called DH to notify him that her and MIL and the kids were rescheduling and would be staying with us all week. Which is hilarious because we’ve told them repeatedly that visits are to be scheduled over a weekend and be 3-4 days max, while DH is around. DH would be gone Monday through Friday so I would be stuck hosting his family here alone. If my in laws were easy going people this would’ve been fine but they suck and  are exceptionally worse when DH isn’t present so DH and I decided together that visits with his family require his presence. DH told SIL that wouldn’t work because MIL needed to be babysat by him. SIL said she’d babysit MIL instead. I told DH that I think being alone with both of them would be harder than being alone with just one of them and that the thought of SIL keeping MIL in check was not reassuring. I told DH that I would not be happy with having them here on the days they were pushing on us but that I would host them for him, for the sake of him seeing his family. I made it clear that I would be kind and accommodating. DH decided, on his own, to cancel the visit altogether. SIL WENT CRAZY.

SIL showed her true colors. It turns out she has been some kind of double agent this whole time who manipulates us into sharing details about our visits with MIL. She will call and complain about her mom, tell me of all these horrible ways that MIL endangered her children, tell me to never let MIL be alone with LO, and then turn around and judge us for being guarded with MIL. Although my own experiences with MIL promoted me to be guarded with her as it is. 

More recap: MIL drinks, smoke marijuana and cigarettes and then wants to hold LO. What’s worse is that she removes LO from mine and DH’s arms. If things weren’t bad enough, she is possessive of LO- makes declarations about how she isn’t going to put her down, how LO is going to go spend extended periods of time at her house, demanding alone time. 

Back to SIL. SIL told DH that they “don’t approve of our parenting choices” because we are apparently so overprotective that it’s “unhealthy” and we’re pushing people away. This is coming from people who have endangered their children and had them taken away and put it in foster care. I’m NOT sorry that my child will never experience those things. Told DH that he “has to learn that other people make sacrifices to come visit” and that it’s “bullshit” that we cancel if it inconveniences us. She was so hung up on her having scheduled to take her kids out of school to visit us that she was ignoring fact that DH took time off of a very demanding job to see them. SIL was outraged that I told her that I prefer for people to ask to hold LO. Funny enough, we started this rule because MIL would take LO out of my arms, which is unacceptable as it is but especially when she has been drinking and/or smoking. SIL thinks that this rule should not apply to her and was trying to get DH to stroke her ego and tell her that it didn’t apply to her 😂 She told DH that I “made her feel like she can’t even hold her own niece” all because she has to ask.

I think that if our rules and boundaries, especially those for LO’s safety, push people away, then they shouldn’t be around LO to begin with. DH and I saw our marriage counselor, as a united front, seeking advice on how to deal with his crazy family. The therapist said that it sounded like they are trying to be LO’s parents. That is how I’ve always felt! I think they feel entitled to our time, space, and baby. They want to be primary caregivers but we don’t trust them. I’ve always welcomed them to see LO and wanted them to hold her, bond, and play with her, but not when INTOXICATED! Not by taking her from our arms. Not alone! But they’re outraged because they think they are entitled to all of those things. Luckily DH and I don’t care anymore, we know we’re good parents and are holding our ground. MIL told DH that she was bothered by the letter/contract that DH wrote her about respecting us and LO and said that she’s going to have a talk with him about it in 2 weeks when we see her again. So we have that to look forward to!

As for SIL, things left on her apologizing to DH and saying that she was just angry and going through a lot. She then pulled the whole “well I guess I’ll probably never see LO now...”. DH just said that he didn’t know if and when we’d be ready to have contact with her again and that it’s her fault. So now SIL is supposedly going to apologize to me but DH told her that she should probably wait a long time before trying to talk to me 😂 

My synopsis of everything is that MIL and SIL are used to having control of DH and maybe were deluded into thinking they had control of me too. They know that I’m a SAHM so they assume I’m home all the time, they know where to find me and think they can come stay whenever they want. They’ve had DH in the FOG but they’re now exposed and losing control and they are FREAKING OUT. They’re outraged. No more allowed to be possessive of LO. No more entitlements, only privileged if they can be trustworthy people.

I guess all I have left to say is that they can kick rocks."
423,"Trigger warning: Cheating.

I am in a state of shock, and I have been for over a week. I will work on a more detailed post (probably tomorrow), when the haze clears.

But I can honestly say that I don’t think that this (already kinda ordinary) relationship can go back to be honest.

The short version is that The Matriarch announced that in front of her E-husband, my boyfriend’s parents as well as my boyfriend, our baby and myself, while we were at home.


I was so stunned, that I totally goldfish-ed the moment (eyes wide open, mouth agape, not much of a response). His parents were watching tv, boyfriend was tending to baby, but did hear the conversation.

Just over a week later, boyfriend proposed while we were on holidays. I said yes.
I am over the moon to be engaged to him, but I can barely stand to look at The Matriarch. I’m furious at myself for not smacking that bitch, or kicking her wrinkly ass out of my house. She got away with insulting my character. And I don’t know how to deal with it."
424,"Hey all! Last week my JNMom inserted herself into drama that had exactly 0.00000000000000% to do with her. She ended up not only getting herself cut out of the lives of no fewer than 7 people, but she ended up cutting me and DH out of her life after I was trying to just put her on a small time out. 

Anyway, DH and I ended up in town with MIL yesterday as he had a follow up and testing scheduled. One appointment was in the morning, another in the afternoon. So we hung out at MIL's in the interim.

About an hour after we arrived, my best friend sent me a screen shot from my mother's public Facebook (you know, the one she claims she deactivated and was never going to go on again???) where she posted some meme about family and defending those you love. DH noticed the eyeroll, asked what was up, and I said, ""You know, the usual. JNMom is defending perverts again.""

Shouldn't have said that. MIL immediately perked up and said, ""What? What about perverts?""

I went into a very limited, basic explanation and y'all... She was livid. To the point that she said if she had my mother's phone number she would have called and blessed her out. She not only defended cousin, but she defended me!

I know that this isn't a ""everything's good now, MIL isn't a JustNo anymore"" moment. I will still be sure to keep my guard up. I just thought it was something worth sharing as it could mean there's been a change of heart or  she could go back to being evil when I see her next. Who knows. I'm just counting this as a small favor."
425,"Longtime lurker, first time poster.Throwaway account due to normal reddit handle being known by family.

My MIL has been a constant pain in my ass since I became pregnant with dd, who just turned one.I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because DH is still DEEEEEEEEP in the fog, but I think there's hope.

Anyways...MIL has followed all of the just no classic behavior (my baaaaaaaaaby in reference to my dd, I am full on incubator status at this point because clearly her precious son does everything at the house, the poor me guilt trip BS), but after this latest incident, I'm ready to be done. I've been gray rocking like a motherfucker, and am as LC as humanly possible.

MIL takes care of her mother, who has dementia and is at the end. And by take care of, I mean uses her social security to supplement her chronic bad money habits. She continuously says that she doesn't know how she's going to afford to stay in her home once her mother dies. Instead of bringing in some in-home help once or twice a week, she lets her mother sit around on her own left to her own devices. She says that bringing someone in would be ""too expensive."" (Uh, that's what the checks your mother receives should pay for.) My DH hates going to visit MIL because her house is filthy (she hoards feral cats) , she lays on the guilt, and she's generally a miserable human to be around. MIL only leaves her house to get her hair done and have lunch with friends. She can't seem to be bothered to leave to come see her precious grandbaby. DH does offer every weekend to bring her down for a visit, but this old bitch always says no. (Frankly, I don't think you can play the martyr if you turn down opportunities.)

DD turned one recently, and we had her family party over the weekend. MIL knew, and told us that she would get her mother moving three hours prior so she would be at the party. (My suggestion of bringing in someone to stay with her was of course shot down because it's too expensive.)  DD's party is scheduled from 1-3, and there are twenty some odd folks who show up to help us celebrate. MIL rolls in at 2:30, and of course begins sobbing hysterically when she sees my DD. I roll my eyes so far back in my head that I could see out of my own asshole and announce that we're doing the cake smash because of course we had to wait until MIL showed up. 20 plus people with plans of their own after the party had to wait on one person. One person who is chronically late to almost every event - baby shower, holiday dinners, and now this.

She checks all of the JN boxes, but those are stories for other days.

Am I allowed to tell her that I'm done, and we're no longer waiting on her to show up, and how incredibly rude I find her behavior?

TL;DR - MIL chronically late and holds up the show - do I get to say ""be there or be square, bitch""?"
426,"My fiancè (M21) and I (F20) got engaged in July after knowing each other less than a year.

I'm very close with my parents, and they're very excited about our engagement as they love my FH. Plus, they only knew each other six weeks before they got engaged, and they've been happily married 36 years (not arranged, just fell in love that quickly).

His parents, however, don't know we're engaged.

They've always been emotionally (and somewhat physically) abusive to FH which he didn't fully acknowledge until he started therapy last spring.

Also, his mother hasn't never been a fan of me even before we met. She's a Southern baptist, and doesn't like that I'm from the North and Catholic. She's never been mean to my face but is constantly passive aggressive about me converting and moving to their tiny Southern town (we've met twice and she's mentioned both these things multiple times). There's much more, but I have limited time and space.

This weekend our parents are meeting for the first time at FH's and I's college, and FH's brother (BIL) has decided to add to what is already going to be a stressful weekend.

BIL is the only member of FH's family to know of our engagement. FH texted him a few weeks after the fact because they've never been super close but close enough FH felt guilty BIL didn't know.

This was apparently a mistake.

BIL has always gone back and forth with staunchly defending MIL and FIL and condemning them for their abuse. I should also mention BIL is gay and recently moved in with his boyfriend in another state. I don't know how much of this MIL and FIL know but I do know they're very homophobic and would be furious if they knew.

Despite all this, BIL texted my FH this morning to let him know he can't keep our secret anymore. He's suddenly acting like MIL and FIL ask BIL about FH and I's relationship 20 times a day, and it's taking a huge toll on him.

BIL sat on his high horse and told my FH ""it isn't right"" my parents know we're engaged and their's don't. He's also apparently been against our engagement from the beginning. Great.

My FH didn't so much as threaten to reveal BIL's secret as FH reminded him they're both keeping secrets from MIL and FIL. BIL described this as a ""pissing contest"" but seemed to take the hint and ended the conversation by saying FH doesn't have to reply, BIL just wanted to get his side out. Ok.

FH doesn't think BIL will actually reveal our secret, but if they were to find out at least my parents will be here this weekend to diffuse the situation.

I suggested maybe fake a proposal in front of both parents, but FH doesn't think it's necessary. I then suggested he float the idea of proposing past his parents to gauge their reaction, and he's considering it.

TLDR: FH's parents don't know we're engaged, and BIL is threatening to expose us despite having a secret boyfriend."
427,"Trigger warning! Physical Abuse ahead. No, I do not need any advice on this. It's already been handled and he no longer has anger issues like this as we have had amazing marriage counseling and he is out of the Fog and is starting to shine that spine up.

Hello! It is me again! I still haven't figured out a name for my MIL, but that will come in due time.

Today, I want to tell you about the time she really showed me her true colors and how I began to realize that she was a JUSTNOMIL.

Now, a little back story. My husband grew up rich. FIL and MIL were making MONIES out the window and practically gave him everything he wanted. New car, school books, paid for his college, Alligator insignia polo shirts... The list is long as he is spoiled. I, grew up with very little. I worked for everything I ever wanted. My first car was a used car that I put hundreds of dollars into making mine. The only thing I had that was expensive, was a used coach bag I found at Goodwill.

When hubs and I found a place to move into, it was a HUGE wake up call to him about how the real world works. I knew he had anger issues, but his true colors showed one afternoon when we got into a heated argument about me catching him on Craigslist flirting with women. He then grabbed my shoulders, shook me like a rag doll while screaming at me, and shoved me onto the couch. I remember being shocked and confused. I was also frightened out of my mind as I had been in a previous relationship that centered on abuse and it brought back some horrifying flashbacks. I looked at him in horror and said ""I can't believe you hit me... After all I've been through, and you knowingly know about my previous ex.... you go and do the ONE thing you swore you'd never do to me...."" I grabbed my keys and walked to my car. I called my mother in tears. I told her to come get my dogs because he was throwing things around and I was scared he was going to hurt them. She said she was on her way and would be at my door in 20 minutes.

I then, thinking that women back each women up in these situations, called MIL.

""Mom... he hit me...""

Her response?

""What did you do?""

I was thrown for a loop... I then told her ever damn detail of what lead him up to hitting me.

""Well, it sounds like he was hungry and tired. You really should give him more sex you know. That's what you're supposed to do. When was the last time you two slept together?""

""Uh....""

""Exactly!""

She continued this rant about how to ""Keep a man happy"" for the next 10 minutes. I stayed silent as I was fuming... she was an enabler... I could see it a mile away. After a few more minutes of me faking ""uh huh... yep... Uh huh..."" I hung up and sobbed for few seconds before I collected myself to go and save my dogs. My mom came a few minutes later and I went to her house for a few nights. Hubs did apologize to me, but at the time, he was too selfish to realize what he had done.

We went to the MIL's house several weeks later for some reason. I can't remember why.... and she pulled me aside and asked me again, what happened. So I told her that I caught him cheating, we argued, and he took his anger out on me.

""Are you sure you two are meant to be together? You know it's okay to divorce him! We can help with the legal fees.""

My first thought ""What the fuck?""

What came out of my mouth. ""No. Hubs and I do not want a divorce. We are seeking counseling and are going to work through this.""

She again, showed her true colors by showing pure disappointment for a brief moment. ""Oh. Well, that's good."" and then she had to go check on something and left me.

When I told my husband what happened he backed her up, ""She didn't mean it like that..."" blah blah blah... but I knew... I knew all too well what was to come... and I was ready for it...

&amp;#x200B;

And that, my dears... is when I started standing up for myself...

&amp;#x200B;

Next time on CTV's MIL story. The time she half assed a present for my son by giving him legos.... for a girl..."
428,"I'm pretty stuck at what to do here. I've poured my heart and anger about my mom, clear as I can, (and what I thought, clear as day), for my Gma and Aunt. I said multiple times this is not a family issue that can be fixed by family and I will not ""fix"" it, I cannot tell other relatives how to ""fix"" it, it has been going on for decades and I'm just done. This morning, I wake up to this text from Aunt:

""Cee, you and DH said you actually want a solution, right? You want your mother to apologize for what she said but more importantly you want her to respect that you have differing world views. Is this all?""

First of all, I think we can all agree that the message seems to be riddled with underlying messages, but what got me the most is ""Is this all?"" after I spent an hour on the phone outlining my mother's inappropriate behavior, how I have been intentionally left out of family vacations, reunions, the never ending insults...no, no. This is not ""all"". They keep bringing it back to religion when that's never been the issue, but they're too stupid to understand decades of insults and ostracizing build up.

I genuinely don't know what to say. After some thought, I sent this:

""Why are you asking? I said I didn't want family involved.""

DH says it was harsh and that it will just enforce my mom's narrative that I'm the bad guy. I don't care. I've been calling relatives crying about my mom's treatment for 15 years at this point and no one intervened for me before. I told Aunt I was in therapy at 19, who told Nmom, who then threw it in my face first chance she got.

I've  thought it through and I could tolerate seeing Nmom at holidays a few times a year. I know she wants every weekend and to stop by the house whenever she feels like it. I don't want her around, I'm over the game of baby sitting my mother's feelings. 

I guess I'm just feeling lost. I keep getting reminded that my feelings and opinions don't matter, only the peace does. I don't understand why these people continue to seek to subjugate me to abuse for the sake of the peace. I'm just done with the whole lot of them"
429,"Hi everyone! Sorry I’m so bad at responding. I get overwhelmed easily and I really wanted to say I appreciate people taking the time to respond to me. I’m trying to get better about it.

Anyways I have some amazing news followed by the reason I’m making this post. For those of you who’ve read my posts you’ll know one of the biggest conflicts in my life was whether or not to keep my daughter. I struggled with it terribly as I *wanted* to but knew that I would struggle to do so without support and didn’t feel right pushing my SO into that spot when I knew he fully wanted adoption even though he said he would still be there for me and support me if I kept her. I just didn’t want to *force* him to step up. But that all changed when I gave birth to her on October 6th. Y’all. It was a hard labor. I posted about it on r/pregnant as it was horrid. But thankfully nothing to do with my JNM as if I had any FMs to worry about they all would’ve thought I was heading home after being induced (my water broke directly after we arrived home and the contractions were so strong that I didn’t update anyone about anything until long after my daughter was born). Unfortunately I didn’t think fast enough about my family so my mother does know my daughter was born and her name but nothing else and it was only after we were approved to be discharged so my mother didn’t have a chance to even try and force a meeting. She texted me about it but that was it.

As for my SO. My goodness. It’s like a light switched on for him. Immediately after our daughter was born he went from being supportive but detached to obsessed with her. Holding her, talking to her, cuddling her, calling himself daddy to her. He just couldn’t stop smiling whenever he got to hold her. It wasn’t long after that he asked me if I still wanted to keep her as he had fallen in love with being her father and wanted to keep her himself now. No longer do I feel like I’m forcing anyone to do anything and my anxiety flew out the door. I can now proudly say I am a mother to the most amazing growling goofy little girl. She looks insanely like me but with all the features of her father that I love (her hair color, the button of a nose but with my bridge... I don’t know she’s the perfect combination of us and she’s only a week and 4 days old. I can’t want to see her grow💛).

All that leads to what I knew I’d eventually have to face. My family. 

My younger sisters sweet 16 is coming up in a couple of weeks. We already have plans to hang out a few days after this one on one but there is basically this big family event going on to celebrate. It’ll be the first birthday celebration we’ve had in a long, long time for someone so it’s kind of important and plus it’s my little sister of course I want to go.

Two things plague me though:

1) while my sister hasn’t made any mention of it I know undoubtedly this even will turn into a spectacle about my SO, myself and our daughter. It will be the first family event we will be going to and the first time everyone in the family will be there and be able to meet her. I won’t be comfortable with just getting a babysitter just yet (separation anxiety is on high here) but I definitely want to go. She hasn’t said she would be bothered by this but I’m afraid as she’s not the type to express her feelings until it’s way too late and she’s pissed off. I almost feel like I’d be acting similarly to the JNMILS you find on wedding posts in this subreddit. Overshadowing my sisters big day with something you can’t even attempt to hide. Would I be a JN if I went despite my good intentions of truly just wanting to see my sister and celebrate the day with her and our family?

The second thing is.. if I go I will have to see my mother. I have a small game plan for this as holidays were already on my mind but so far it’s just “ignore her until she makes a scene about me ignoring her. If she makes a scene shut her down”. But again I feel like I would become the JN in this situation for my sister as she is in a small way a FM. Trying to convince me to just forgive and forget my mothers insanity to keep the peace. So if I in any way cause this meltdown by not acknowledging my mother or over acknowledging my mother or hell just being *near* my mother.. ugh I just want my sister to have a fantastic birthday. We never did anything special for my sweet 16 so I was shocked when I found out people were planning something for my sister (again I just made separate plans to hang out) so it’s a big deal. I want her to look back on this and smile and I’m not sure how to navigate this. If there’s a fight she’ll be upset. If I don’t show up she’ll be upset (as would I). Etc etc.

And then finally dear redditors, I got all this from a group text. My mother has messaged the whole family asking us to respond to her directly if we are coming to the party so she can keep track of how many seats we’ll need. This isn’t an unreasonable request. But I don’t want to contact her directly. I don’t want her to think she can force me to communicate even though in this instance.. she just might do just that! I don’t think it’s a good idea to communicate through my sister again as it’s not fair to her to make her play messenger between my mother and I. Before hand I was simply telling my sister my responses directly so my mother couldn’t twist my words. But it’s different if I have to tell my sister to play telephone with myself and our mother.

Gah. This is long and hectic and I’m paranoid from a lack of sleep. As always any advice welcome. I just need to know what to do or what you would do if you were in my shoes. Do I go? Do I skip out despite it hurting myself and my sister? If I do go how do I respond to the text? And how do I make sure the spotlight stays on my sister on her big day without leaving my baby with someone else? How do I exist?????

Thanks in advance y’all and this time I’ll try harder to respond to everyone who comments. Y’all are so good and welcoming I truly do appreciate having an outlet to take all this to."
430,"I have a beautiful boy who has awful grandparents. I have had dig after dig sent across the dinner table at me for 6 years. Except for the past 7 months being NC! I’ve left many dinners or Christmas days with clenched jaw from anger and then floods of tears all the way home.

After the birth of DS, I really wanted them to be involved, I invited them over all the time. Every few days. I decided to put everything behind me but the digs kept coming. Specifically about racial issues (I identify as 3 nationalities) among other things. 

I’ve decided that they will pay the ultimate price and DH knows this. They will not be told about my next baby (to be conceived) till I’m comfortable them knowing. They will not meet this child till I’m done breastfeeding and it can be taken from me for the day. I don’t even want them to be sent photos but of course, DH wants them to see their grandchild. I just hate that they can be so toxic to me yet have access to my kids. Makes me so angry. 

DH is vlc and only visits 1x every 1-2 months for an hour or two. I literally never want to see them again ever. And I never want my kids to be left with them. Who knows what they’ll say and how they’ll make them feel about themselves. They somehow make me feel like there’s something wrong with just existing. I was born in the wrong year (which makes me a millennial) I was born of the wrong parents (part x part y which are two races they are constantly putting down) 

And if I stand up for myself I’m over reacting or being dramatic or being too sensitive and free speech is a thing. 

I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone about this so just needed to vent.

Thanks for listening!"
431,"Sorry for the typos, trying to post before my wind down starts.

I flared this as a **success** because if i'm being completely honest, it is. Thanks to reading this sub and getting feedback about my own JNMIL months and months ago before I nuked my account, I was able to gather the tools to help her really understand that I had finally had enough of her shit. I'll try to make this as short as I can but it probably won't be. **TL:DR at bottom**

&amp;#x200B;

My JNMIL was given the name **Mother of All Mothers or MOAM** by my DH due to her obsessive need of wanting to basically tell everyone how to live their lives, how to parent their own children, and over stepping her boundaries as a mother, grandmother, and mother in law. She was given the nickname **Cuntrol Freak** a few months ago on this exact same sub for all of the same things I listed but like I said I nuked my account. So if you remember me, yes i'm back. If you don't, enjoy the ride...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. So my DH &amp; I just recently started back talking to my JNMIL after being strictly NC for about 6 months due to something too stupid to even type out but it caused my DH to drop the rope and cut her off completely until she was ready to apologize (honestly, I'm so in love with the man, it's scary). The narcissist in her thought that we would grovel at her feet because in her mind, we needed her. After 6 months of not a peep from us and me going  so dark not even her friends could see pictures of our LO, she decided to try and be the bigger person.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes over and we start the conversation catching up on everything she has missed out with us and our LO. Everything is going well. Everyone is saying their peace and just trying to unravel the events and the things that were said to make her go nuclear and put all of the blame on me. I've been on this sub enough to know when something is too good to be true when a JNMIL is apologizing, than it is. Now I will say that when all of this first happened, I used one of my books of faces to subliminally vent about her. Then again, I didn't care because being in my 30s, I can post whatever I want. Of course MIL doesn't like when she's made to look like something other than the perfect person to anyone including people she'll never meet in her life. So I should have known that she wasn't going to be able to leave without trying to get one last little upper hand of control. Only thanks to you guys, my spine was titanium built that day and I wasn't backing down....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: OP, I honestly didn't like what you posted about me on the book of faces and my friends don't like that they're blocked and can't see pictures of LO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well that's unfortunate. I""m sorry you feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I just know that if DH ever posted stuff like that about (my JYM's name) i'd rip him a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Well for one, my mother isn't a narcissist so I'm sure he wouldn't ever have a reason to post things like that about my JYM. For two, after years ago when you hacked DH's book of faces without his permission to spy on my page, you have always been blocked. Your friends were blocked because if you can't apologize so you can see LO then I will block everyone that associates with you so no one can sneak you pictures of LO. Also with the many things I've heard you and FIL say about me since DH &amp; I have gotten together, a few memes and post on the book of faces should be the least of your worries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: I have never said anything negative about you. I love all of my daughter in laws. Now FIL on the other hand has said some not so nice things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: Now I know for a fact that is a lie. The things that I have heard you say about me have all come from your own children. Between that and my own personal control tussles I've had to have with you, I hardly have any space left in my notebook from trying to keep track, if you would like me to pull them out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JNMIL: Well no. I'm sure you are telling the truth. I just don't want anymore problems. I just don't like that you guys used LO against me and now I seem like the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OP: You are the bad guy. You chose being an ass over apologizing so that you can see your grandchild and every time there is a problem, you will be cut off. I've cut off my own family because of their toxic behavior and I will cut you and your family off from LO if I see the same toxic behavior being displayed. Just because DH is your child doesn't mean you all get to say and do as you please and still get to see MY child. The disrespect towards me as a woman and as LO's mother stops today or so help me none of you will ever see her or be around her again.

It was hilarious to see her look at my DH in hopes that he would come to her defense. The icing on the cake was him telling her that we are adults and she no longer get to tell him what to do. He gave her the whole talk about how being a grandparent and being in LO's life is a privilege not a right and that when it comes to LO, what we say goes and most importantly, what I say goes... I have now been promoted back to the favorite DIL and we haven't had a problem since.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR: Went NC with MIL for 6 months, she decides to apologize BUT not without trying to regain the means to control me. Gets shut down by DH &amp; I.**"
432,"So today I send my mom a few messages about thoughts i had regarding my parents. Specifically I told her I realized they both are using me as an outside enemy to stabilise their relationship.

I thought i I could trust her to not show it to my dad, but instead she just did that and read it to him.

Afterwards chaos ensued, both of them started sending me messages and started calling me multiple times despite me telling them I don't want to discuss anything right now as my big one is home because of holidays and i wanted to spend quality time with him.

Instead i I had to to talk to them for like two hours which ended in some kind of screaming match because they just did not leave me in peace.

How do I tell my mom to leave me in peace and listen to what i say? How do I tell her I am old enough to make my own decisions and that she should not start cleaning up my stuff just like that."
433," I had a fight with my MIL regarding SIL and I’m not sure how to proceed. Often I get along with MIL on a personal level. So this is a bit random.

In our first year of marriage, SIL went through a rebellious stage and ran away from MILs house. DH asked her to move in with us without consulting me first. I went along with it because I thought it was the right thing to do and MIL seemed happy. It put some strain on our marriage. Eventually she moved out and it became obvious that SIL was jealous of me living with DH. She kept trying to pull him away from me at family gatherings. Posting on Facebook how she would cry herself to sleep every night because he didn’t live with her anymore. I unfriended her from Facebook and I decided to stop making effort to talk to her because I found it stressful and wanted to get away from the drama.

I didn’t have a great relationship with BIL either but recently things have gotten better. DH and I have been hanging out with BIL and his partner. A couple of weeks ago we went to see a comedy show. SIL found out and got upset as she always does. Says, “Why does no one invite me?” 

I decided to tell her why. While getting space and disconnecting from SIL had helped destress me and remove from the drama, family gatherings had become quite awkward. Awkward because we never spoke and awkward nobody else seemed to notice we didn’t speak. Although afterwards she would tell my husband that I didn’t say hello to her. After witnessing and staying silent during a few family arguments, I thought it wasn’t a good idea to keep bottling it up.

I decided this was a good chance as ever to tell her why. I said, “I’ve been keeping you at a distance because I felt like you were smothering my husband and getting jealous because he didn’t live with you anymore. It was too much for me. I get annoyed when people in this family treat him like he’s the father because the real one left. He’s not your father. He’s your brother.”

This caused a shit storm. Yes, I know what I said was blunt. MIL told me she was disgusted and offended on behalf of everybody. SIL called me a nasty person and said I was out of line. I expected them to be upset but not this upset. 

I tried to talk it out later with MIL. She kept saying, “That’s not how we sort things out in this family.”

I tried to keep calm while talking with MIL but she kept replying not in response to me. Like, she’d say, “How would you like it if your husband kept you from your family?” and I’d say, “I don’t keep him from his family and he doesn’t keep me from mine” and she would respond, “I don’t look for faults in anyone.” In the end I snapped because it felt like she was responding to things I wasn’t actually saying. SIL had also said, “It’s obvious you don’t approve of the way we were raised” you will never know what it’s like to grow up in a broken family”. I guess the first sentence is true - I think they don’t set good and consistent boundaries with one another which leads to arguments and hurt. The second one, while my parents are still together, it’s not as if I haven’t faced significant challenges in my relationship with them. 

When I snapped, I said to MIL, “Well if anyone should be disgusted and offended it’s me. A few years ago your other son sexually harassed me and you did NOTHING. It was comments about myself and my family, cyberbullying and showing his private parts to me. When I told you, you laughed. Your own parents said, “He wouldn’t do such a thing! You need to understand that brothers are groomsmen in each others weddings!” If it ever happens again I will call the police. I get annoyed that this family sweeps things under the carpet. I should be offended and disgusted for being expected to put up with this shit. Your expectations and rules only apply to your daughter, not anyone else.""

No reply to that. It’s been a couple of weeks since we’ve talked. 

Husband had had a stressful day at work when all this went down. He didn’t really want to deal with it. Even since then, he’s barely said a word about it when I try to talk about it. He met up with his sister for coffee to sort things out. He didn’t really tell me much about it, apart from that she said if she did that to someone in her partner’s family, she’d be kicked out. Implying she wants me to not be part of the family. 

DH also keeps his distance because she’s dramatic but won’t say anything. He always seems to do this when shit goes down with his family. It’s frustrating feeling like I’m left to fend for myself.

So now, I don’t know what to do. Christmas is a couple of months away and I’m not sure if I should go to DH’s side of the family’s gathering. Also I don’t know how to proceed with MIL."
434,"MIL rang my husband to see if I would talk to her on the phone. He told her no, and to email me(well done DH). I don’t know what else she said because DH is also at work and couldn’t talk, he sounded very upset though.

So she emailed me asking to talk on the phone. 

I’ve made it clear in no uncertain terms multiple times I’m unwilling to do this. It feels disrespectful that she keeps asking but I don’t know if that’s unreasonable.

I just thought we were done with this now I’m sat at work feeling all churned up again. I think I’m just going to send back a short “no and here’s why”. 

I don’t know what advice I’m looking for, I just feel horrible again."
435,"(TW: Ignorant homophobic tendencies and clearly outdated gender norms)

This one will be short throwback to when we still lived in the MIL danger zone. It’s a crowd favorite with my friends and I feel it perfectly captures BIGGERMILs thought process on damn-near-everything outside of her trailer park window.


 
It involves my wedding party. You see, I do not have many friends and of that small, small number- even less are women. My best friend in the whole world is a man. We will call him BFF for ease. So naturally, when I went to get married I asked/told him that he needed to be a part of my *entourage*.

 

BFF is a sports fan, deeply funny, southerner who lives in the PNW, a runner, a dirty liberal and…. gay. In case you’re wondering I described his qualities in order of importance. His partner is the only man I’ve ever found to be funnier than BFF, also a southerner, and best described as a dirty hippy version of a Disney princess. They are perfect and they live very far away, so naturally any time we can get together, we do!

 

Well, when talking about the wedding party to the IL’s (Future at the time), I mentioned that BFF would be on my side. BIL2 made a teenage attempt at a joke and asked if BFF would be wearing a dress (he does have the legs for it but that is not the point) and BIGGERMIL perked up. “WHY WOULD BFF BE IN A DRESS. BFF IS A MMMMAAANNNNN.” BIL2, correctly ashamed at his terrible try at humor, said BFF was gay.

 

This woman. Instead of the litany of intolerance I expected to come pouring out of her face- got quiet.

 

BIGGERMIL: “Does he have a…..a….”

 

OP: “…boyfriend? Yes, but we’re not sure he can come with work and…”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “…excuse me? What now?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Is BFF the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “What?”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP: “They are gay. There is no woman.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “Yes, I know…but who is the woman in the relationship?”

 

OP (clearly frustrated): “THAT IS THE POINT OF BEING GAY. THERE IS NO WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP. IT IS TWO MEN. NO WOMEN. NO WOMEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP.”

 

BIGGERMIL: “…but who does the cooking and cleaning?”

 

 

Y’ALL. This woman."

&amp;#x200B;

I have not spoken to my mother in 10 months after she utterly betrayed me, essentially robbed me and painted me as the bad guy to her husband - see the above previous post for info. 

Following the above I went completely No Contact with her. I have had missed calls but beyond that until this week she has not tried to get in touch. And whilst it has been hard I think this year has been the most free I have felt in my entire life. Yes I have cried and missed who I thought my mother was and gotten very angry but gradually I have let go of my anger and concentrated on my life with my husband. Without the burden of taking care of her I have focused on work and received two promotions, fallen even deeper in love with the epic man I call my husband and simply lived my life the way I want to for the first time ever. Whilst I am out of pocket I will save money by a long way by simply not having her there so I really hope that the money she took was worth it!

It was my birthday this week and I had said to my DH that she would do something, he said no way! And lo and behold on the morning of my 34th birthday a card arrived. My DH sent me a skype and I asked him to open it as I was working - I I half expected an apology or a cheque or something to make amends. But no - simply a card wishing me happy birthday with a childhood nickname and a reminder that I 'am the most important thing in her life' . DH was furious, raging about how fucked up this was, that she even though she could contact me. I was not angry or raging or even sad - just accepting. I asked DH to put return to sender with her address on and pop it into the post. 

It's really odd. I wasn't bothered, I was disappointed but none of the hot emotions really existed any more and that's when it hit me - I think I am truly over it. I am over missing her (or who I thought she was). I am over her and she is simply nothing to me now. I have returned the card and now can focus on life with DH, our life together and celebrating with our great friends this weekend. She doesn't have lodgings in my head anymore. And she won't again.

I have flaired this as 'Success!' and I know it isn't dramatic or shiny spined or anything but to me it is a success. She is not my burden and her betrayal of me is nothing now because she is nothing to me now and I am free to live my life without the anger that I had clouding my entire life a year ago!"
437,"First time poster on here. I don’t like my MIL. She’s never done anything awful to me, but she’s done lots of little things that have led me to like her less and less over the 12 years I’ve been with my husband (3 married). I’d be totally fine if I never saw or spoke to her again. Every time I know I’m going to have to spend time with her I get anxious in the days leading up to it. This inevitably leads to arguments with my husband who knows she’s annoying but just is used to putting up with it. 

Here are some of the reasons I don’t like her (get along with her?)

1. She’s Greek and I’m just a white (American) mutt. All she ever talks about is Greece. “You should be learning Greek. You need to go to Greece more (not opposed to going to the country, just not to spend 2 weeks with the family in the “suburbs”). In Greece we eat this. Greek people are superior humans, etc “ She’s lived in the US for 40 years yet acts like she just got here last week. She openly suggests that her son should have married a Greek woman. 

2. She’s boring and we have nothing in common. She was a SAHM her whole life and never really picked up any hobbies or outside interests. Nothing against SAHMs, and I actually think it’s sad that they feel like they need to be 100% focused on child rearing and nothing else or else they’re bad moms. But now that her three sons are adults all she does is go shopping, get her hair and nails done, and go to Pilates. I’m kind of a tomboy so none of this is of particular interest to me (not her fault). I don’t expect her to like my hobbies either, but at least mine aren’t all self absorbed and give me things to talk about (animal rescue, cooking, travel, hiking). 

3. Throws fits to get attention. She loves the idea of having a codependent relationship with her Sons. She wants to treat them like babies (buy their clothes, buy them food, wash their clothes when they visit her house) but also expects them to drop everything to care for her. If she comes to visit our city she makes my husband order Uber/lyft for her even when they’re not together, makes us pay for all meals (even though FIL makes plenty of money), gets whiny when we don’t offer her food and beverages as soon as she’s in our apartment. If my husband doesn’t do these things she throws a fit and gaslights him into thinking he’s a bad son. I usually can’t understand their fights because they’re in Greek (another shitty thing she does, talks in Greek in front of me and sometimes about me) but my husband usually tells me afterwards. He leaves out details to protect her and make it seem like she’s not overreacting. I feel bad for him in these situations because he’s a great guy and doesn’t deserve the shit she gives him for not kissing her ass enough. 

4. Makes me see my husband as a child. This one is the worst. When I see how he acts around her all I can think is “oh he’s not an adult right now” and I hate that. I hate that it changes him into the nervous child who just wants to please Mommy. Because he’s so worried about her, he kind of forgets about me and my feelings so I usually end up just trying to hold my own. I’m very good at pretending that I don’t need anyone (I’m in therapy for this problem) so I get why he thinks it’s okay to prioritize her feelings. It’s not okay though and I’ve begun to push back on him on this. He sort of gets it, but not fully. It’s hard for him to accept that she has this control over him because from the outside he seems like a successful, independent man. She also clearly hates the idea of me not being the type of wife who practically wipes their husbands ass. In her mind I should be home cooking all his meals and ironing all his clothes all day instead of having a full time job. 

These are the main things, but she does many of small things as well like referring to me as “farm girl” at the beginning and suggesting my rural upbringing was somehow going to derail her precious son’s life. She also blew up on my husband when I didn’t respond to a text she sent me fast enough, saying I “spit in her face”, apparently a Greek euphemism. 

I don’t have the energy or interest to try to fix or build the relationship. My husband wishes I did but knows that that would just mean kissing her ass and not her actually putting in any work. It makes me not want to have kids with him, something we’re on the same page about right now. It will probably get worse if I continue to just be annoyed but apathetic."
438,"Things went well. FDH and I went to their house about 7-7:30pm as discussed. We hugged, we cried, cried some more, it was good. 

Lady M brought up the whole religion thing in regards to our wedding. I was worried when she started talking. 

She told us she understood we would do things the way we wanted and they even had a moment to themselves after we left after the big argument and realised they needed to step back. 

Lady M and JYDad just hadn’t realised I was ‘atheist’ until that night and that was a bit of a shock to them. She says they’re going to be accepting of it, as they are for B1 being atheist. When she gets in her super JN-moods though, she puts him down about it. It’s annoying. 

To clarify: I don’t think I’m atheist as I still believe there’s something out there, just not God and Jesus and stuff, I just don’t know what I am at this point. I’ll still follow the cultural ways of (home country) and be a non-religious-Orthodox. Pretty much, just around Easter and Christmas; our big holidays. 

My parents (JYDad and Lady M) gave us leftover pet meat for our cats and the dog’s couch, barely used. His regular bed is staying in it’s spot in front of the fireplace until Lady M is ready to move it. 

Lady M and I discussed whether she was still up to seeing Maleficent 2 this weekend with B1’s GF. She said yes. Then JYDad chimes in saying he wanted to go too. So we changed it from a lady-date to a triple-date. All three ladies, all three guys. 

Sorry if this is rambly. I’m just trying to get it all out. 

And a massive thank you to those who sent a message in regards to the dog. He was like an annoying little brother. We all loved him so much. 

Lady M also let us know it was heart failure that got him. The vet said it would be expensive to start treatments and even then there would be less than a 5% chance he’d make it through. JYDad told the vet he didn’t want dog suffering anymore. We’ll always love him so much."

I started to write a long post, but... I got about halfway through and had to stop. Rereading and rehashing conversations (I have well over 4k pages of screenshots and such in a folder) and seeing the rewriting of history, the control tactics, the gaslighting, even some i'd missed before, was just too much for me tonight. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for tonight, I'm gonna write about TPP-isms, or advice TPP gave out throughout my childhood/early parenthood. 

&amp;#x200B;

*“You can’t get in the tanning bed; you’re too young and it’ll keep your eggs from developing”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“You’re 13 now so you can use my tanning beds so your skin will even out. Just put a washcloth over your monkey (vagina. This is what she made us call vaginas. I didn’t know the proper name till I was 11, though she’d given me VERY graphic sex talks from 5+) so it doesn’t cook your eggs”* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“You should wash your hair every day, because if not it’s oily and you look like a (racial slur). If you’d wash your hair everyday it’d be so much healthier!” (During the infamous sleepovers she'd come in my room screaming and make me stop hanging out with my friends to go wash my hair.)*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“You have morning sickness? Why are you sick right now, it’s not morning!”* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“What? (When I told her I had been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidorum) I’ve never heard of that. You’re 4 months along, you should be over your sickness. I think you just don’t want this baby so you’re making it up. I’m gonna mention it to your doctor at your next appt.”* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“If you teach DD to say those words (ahem, penis and vagina) you’re setting her up to be molested!”* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*To my Obgyn who recommended a csection, “I don’t think she needs a csection. I never got to experience labor; I want her to feel what it feels like to be in labor and hurt for your child.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“You don’t need anymore than 5 pairs of panties and 2 bras. If you’d wash more often you’d have more than enough: don’t buy anymore underwear!”* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*“Baths don’t get you clean.”* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""If you raise your arms over your head while pregnant it'll wrap the cord around the baby's neck.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""If you'd just get out of the bathroom and started cleaning or cooking supper you wouldn't even know you were sick to your stomach!""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""I don't think you need a zofran pump. I think you need to go to a psychiatrist because it's all in your head.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""You need to stop being such a picky eater and just get over it. That's why you've gotten so big. That doctor was a quack, you do not have an eating disorder""*

&amp;#x200B;

*""There is no such thing as anxiety. It's all in your head so you can be fucked up and not have to deal with reality. Don't become a pill head like (her sister, my two cousins).""* 

&amp;#x200B;

""*It's not fair that (my aunt on my dad's side) gets to see and keep DD everyday and I don't. Why can't you just not let her see her but once a week like she does me?""*"
440,"Tw: talk of medical conditions and hospitals

*Edit: I've removed some details about us*

I have a really wonderful SO. He's the best thing that will ever happen to me.

For as long as I've known him, he's been a hypochondriac. He has no history of chronic illness or childhood illness. The worst medical events he's ever had were a broken ankle one time and some bruised ribs another time. 

*Edit: hypochondriac is the term he uses for himself and I apologize if it's triggering for some. I did not assign that term to him, he did. He feels it fits because he has unfounded fears about his health. He worries that simple health maladies are serious illnesses.*

But he freaks OUT whenever he's got something going on. Skin rash for a week? Must be cancer or something. Persistent headache? Brain tumor. Wrenched something in his neck that's fucked up for two weeks? Persistent stress about some horrible illness he doesn't have. 

And he'll sit there agonizing over it, knowing that it's probably in his head, thinking about seeing a doctor, knowing they likely won't find anything, deciding not to see a doctor, and worrying until whatever it is, is gone. He can go through that mental cycle multiple times a day and not want to talk about it, because talking about it makes the fears more real in his head and gives them a kind of legitimacy that he doesn't want to lend those fears. 

Sometimes he doesn't see a doctor when he absolutely should because of his hypochondria.  Like if he has a persistent upper respiratory infection, he'll just wait it out. 

A few nights ago he casually told me that his mom and grandma used to THREATEN HIM WITH THE HOSPITAL CONSTANTLY AS A CHILD. HOSPITAL. AS A PUNISHMENT.

I looked at him and said, holy fucking shit no wonder you're a hypochondriac! 

He looked at me and it's like I hit him in the face with a brick. This has been such a painful realization for him. I could see it. His face looked like that meme of that woman doing calculus. 

To this day if he complains of a minor ailment (neck pain, for example) the first thing MIL suggests is the hospital. Now I think she does that on purpose just to get a kick out of his mental agony and watching him go pale. 

Thanks MIL. You're a fucking peach. Thanks for torturing the person I love more than the entire world. Also fuck you. FUCK YOU GODDAMN IT FUCK YOU. 

I'm sure other people have similar stories considering how many narcissistic parents exist in the lives of people in our network. You're more than welcome to share your stories. I'm so sad. Also if anyone has any one-liners I can snap at MIL next time she suggests my SO goes to the hospital, that would be appreciated. If I don't have a plan for what to say I might just tell her to go fuck herself without explanation. Not the best look, eh?"

This may be just BEC, but I just wanted to vent. So like many JNMIL’s here, my MIL, MITM (monkey in the middle) likes to treat DH like her emotional Sonsband in my opinion. For reference, DH has three younger brothers. BIL1 is NC and lives in a different state with his dad (jyfil). BIL2 &amp; BIL3 are in grade school and live with MitM and sfil. He is not close with BIL2&amp;3 given the age gap. MitM is CONSTANTLY  texting (bombarding) DH about everything, especially his brothers. I’m talking 16 blurry pictures in a row from their sports game. Or “look at what BIL’s did today!” “BIL did this!” Or 28 pictures of “today things”. RANDOM things. I’m talking the dogs, her pantry, what she’s making for dinner, things she saw at the store, random signs, etc. 

What gets me the most is what she texts him about his two younger brothers. Once she forwarded DH and email from BIL1’s teacher. It was the THIRD day of school and it was all “he pushes boundaries and doesn’t listen” (wonder where he learned that from?) and she was all “do you think i should take him to a GT school?” “his teacher sent me this today”. I just feel like that’s a conversation to have with your HUSBAND. The father of BIL? She’ll say things like “did i tell you we went to parent teacher conferences today?”. Things like that I know are just BEC, but like DH doesn’t care!! They’re not his kids!! 

Recently there was an issue involving a substitute at a school in the district (not BILS school) for bullying a child. Sub was also BIL’s recreational sports coach. Mitm found out and then tried to press charges on sub/coach because he hugged BIL “too long” and kissed his forehead. Mind you, this was after they won their game, INFRONT of MitM. (not saying he innocent or whatever but she didn’t make a big deal ab it til he got in trouble as a sub) Mitm proceeds to text DH everything that’s happened (not much but she made it into a lot) and is all “do you think i’m doing the right thing?” “should i do this” “what do you think?”. And AGAIN I feel like this is a conversation for your HUSBAND. The child’s father?? 

She also messaged him once ranting about SFIL and how she doesn’t agree with his parenting and she feels like she has to be a buffer to the kids and how she’s not sure about him etc. Basically it was a whole rant that you would tell a close girl friend, not your son. I just feel like she tries to involve him in things that aren’t his place.  I feel like that’s inappropriate to talk to
your son about, but that may be just me. 

At the end of the day it’s not really my problem. I’m NC with her because when she texts, she sends 20+ messages in a row. I wish i was kidding. He brushes her off with short answers “i’m sure it’ll be okay.” “That’s cool” etc or just ignores her. It’s really just BEC because EVERYTHING she does irritates me."
442,"I am in need of advice I (26f) have been in a relationship with my husband (28M) for 6 years. He has a very close relationship with her, she was a single mom and he is very protective and in tune with her. A quality that I initially loved. 
We have a happy relationship, we got married last year. We are both committed to our professions he is in his doctorate and I am starting my career as a corporate lawyer.
This also means we are in a ton of debt from school and are busy all the time.  We have no kids. 

At this point the prospect of us having children is still very uncertain. My husband states he does not know if he wants children, preferring to spend our own day dual income travelling, buying nice things and eating good food. He is so supportive of my aspirations and has not once said anything to pressure me into motherhood. I am a bit more leaning towards having children but I am no where near that point in my life yet. I feel like I have worked so hard to start a career that I honestly love I really want to focus on that for the next 5 years before I decide on having kids. Also hello, 150k in student line of credit, I would go bankrupt if I had a baby now as my husband is still in school. 

Additionally, I got some scaryish medical news about 6m ago , I have to get a procedure done to remove pre cancerous cells from my cervix (get your paps!!! ). Procedure is routine but can cause problems with pregnancy later on.  Prior to this news I was going to get colopscopys every 6 months for the past 3 years at the cancer center after an irregular pap. This whole situation has made me very guarded and not want to talk about kids because I don't want to get my hopes up and then not be able to. 

When I first met him, I had a very close relationship with my MIL,  sadly this has all gone down hill.  About two years ago she started having baby rabies and would make insensant comments about me having children. They would be little things like how much she wanted to be a grandma, how she would be the best grandma, how she was turning her home into a nursery for our future children, that she was just a 'Jewish mother'   ect . I didn't really respond at that point and usually changed the topic or was silent.

The comments started to escalate, telling me that  she hopes I have ""her grand babies"" (hate that term but using it for effect) that they will be beautiful and that I have to name them after her father. She also made comments about how she hopes I make room for children despite my career. Again I have never brought up this topic.  

It was constant, she would go thrift shopping and show me toys she would give to my babies, again that I never told her we were having kids. 

One year ago my husband an I  bought her an antique toy that was identical to the one that her late   father gave her when she was younger for her birthday. She burst out crying grabbed my belly and asked when we were expecting. Obviously she misunderstood the gift, which is somewhat understandable I guess, so I wasn't too  mad. But it showed me that it was very clear she wanted grandbabies.

When  I casually mentioned to her that  theoretically we may move to another city for an academic position down the road but we weren't really sure where we would end up settling down, she blurted out I will move wherever you do so I can see my grandbabies and take care of them. And that she would move anywhere for her granbabies. 

Prior to this point I had not expressed to anyone that these comments were getting to me. But about 7 months ago I told my husband. Who trying to help went straight to his mom and told her essentially that your comments about babies  upsetting my wife. I was  upset at him at the time as I felt like he was not standing up for me and he should of said that the comments were upsetting us.  My Mil responded hysterically showing up announced with an apology pie and asking if  I hated her. I said no and and we moved on. 

A week later in the spirit of reparation I baked her a challah when we were going over for dinner. I figured she would appreciate the food she used to eat while growing up and I love baking.   I gave her the bread and she was so happy. Then she proceeded to ask me, loudly and I front of family, 'does this mean you are embracing my Jewish roots and will circumsize my grandbabies?!? "" I was mortified and honestly so offended because she knew that I didn't want her to make these comments. Also that is a very personal question to ask. 

 Sometime after this while at a family members wedding shower my Mil  announced in front of everyone, that she was"" giving me one year to have her grandbabies""  I didn't know anyone in the room and I was so upset she did it again. I also felt super disrespected as a working woman because I had just started my career and she knew my plans were to focus on that. 

Things got even worse when a close family friends daughter got pregnant and had a kid. This friend is one of my best friends her husband and my husband are also best friends. I had been a supportive friend to her all along and helped with all trials and tribulations during pregnancy and helped throw a bomb baby shower.  after her baby was born my husband and I made plans to go visit, my Mil insisted she tag along. I was opposed to this but my husband had already agreed so she came with us. I was so upset because she was obviously so excited for them and did not speak to me at all. I felt so bad as I was so distant meeting my little nephew, I was honestly afraid to hold him out of fear of her comments and being made humiliated again. I have a very close relationship with my BFF and her lil guy I just feel aweful that I shut down

Since he was born my Mil has covered her entire fridge with his photos, and spent thousands on baby gifts.  I can't help but feel like babies is all she cares about. Despite graduating from law school and getting a job she has not once gone out of her way to congratulate me beyond mentioning it in passing. I hate that this gets in the way of me feeling happy for my BFF, I don't want to feel jealous or resentful but the whole thing makes me feel like she doesn't want me for her son or that she would be happier if I didn't work and have babies. It makes me feel shameful and sad, like her love is conditional on me having her grandbabies. 

Sometime around this time, After just recieving  a job offer  we went over to my Mil house because she wanted to cook us dinner. I get in the door and the first thing my Mil  asked me was ""how to you spell aerola""  I was silent, she proceeded to tell me she was texting my BFF about breast feeding and how you ""need to massage the milk glands fold your nipple and shove it in your babies mouth"" no joke that was the first thing she said to me. I was silent, like what do you even say to that.  So I sat down and started putting dates into my new day planner, she noticed I hadn't answered and said "" I guess you are too much of a workaholic to talk about babies with me"" .  I was silent again. 


I withdrew from my mother in law at this point, but eventually my husband encouraged me to talk it out with her and tell her how I feel. So we met up about a month ago with my husband present.  I explained to her the following: the comments about grandbabies make me feel bad, like I am not what she wants for her son and that she doesn't respect my career, we aren't planning to have kids right now and we don't know if we will have kids ever, I told her that because of our financial situation I would literally go bankrupt if I had a child so  the pressure to have children makes me feel even more like she doesn't respect my children or my choice to go to school for 8 years, I also reiterated to her something she has been aware of, that I was going to cancer center to monitor my cervix and that the idea of not having kids is painful for me so I need to not have pressure from her as dealing with my own reproductive health and expectations is enough of a burden. I told her that I love her and want to have her in my life but she absolutely has to stop.  She immediately started bawling and saying how terrible she was as a person. Which of course got my husband to be super nice to her. We ended the conversation on good terms and planned  to move on. 

Fast forward to last weekend when we attended my BIL Engagement party.  She proceeded to tell everyone, in front of me that she was saving the games for her future grandbabies. My BIL and his wife are not planing on having kids either but state that they may adopt at some point, both my BIL and  future SIL are going to school to upgrade and are not actively adopting. I brushed it off but again I felt like she didn't respect me. 

That night my MIL messaged me saying sorry for the comment, I had drank half a bottle of wine, and respond how I felt "" I feel like my worth to you is dependent on me having children, you know this and you don't stop"" . My MIL responded saying that I was being mean and that  not everything is about you. World war three has now erupted in the family with her calling my husband and telling him that"" I hate her, that I am too sensitive and that she feels like she can't talk about anyone's babies round me"" during this phone call she was bawling hysterically and hyperventilating. She then said to my husband "" it's okay if you disown me because you need to support your wife"" he basically reassured her that this was all okay and we would work it out. I felt like this was her manipulating everyone so that she could be the victim. 

Advice : 
Is my Mil behaviour out of line?  Do I even have a right to be mad? Is she gas lighting me? Do I have a reason to be mad at my husband for never standing up for me?  Literally wtf do I do?"
443,"Been with the love of my life for 5 years. 

It has been the most wonderful 5 years of my life. Kind, caring, empathic man, he cannot be faulted.

His mother has terrified me since day one.

She is judgemental, controlling and obnoxious.

Some examples: ""you can't go out with my son looking like that, you will humiliate him"" when asked why, she said doesn't like the colour green and I was wearing green.

""Why can't you two leave each other alone for even 5 minutes?"" Because we love each other very much.

She obsesses about food, she called me fat. I am 5ft 7"" and was 10,5 stones at the time. 

She has called me a sad, desperate single mother who has tricked her son into falling in love with him.

When I booked a holiday for us for his 30th birthday, she said I was using it as a weapon to hold power over him, because it was too much of a grand gesture. 

Things like that.

I have had NC for over a year now following a huge row when she came to visit last summer. 

Except for a month ago when she phoned SO to explain that she had got me all wrong and she can see that now, that I am a nice person and she had misjudged me. I thought this was very suspicious and very out of the blue. But SO told me it was because he had been speaking to her about me, in my defence so she had taken it on board. So SO asked/pleaded with me to go to her house for the weekend so she could talk to me.

It was a very expensive trip and we are not well off. 

She didn't bring it up at all. She also nit picked at how close we are, in public!

I posted recently because SO wanted us to spend the weekend at her house for our anniversary and with all your amazing support and advice, we booked a hotel instead.

Sadly we have had to cancel the whole trip due to some really worrying financial difficulties we are facing, put of the blue. We are devastated.

But now I am thinking about our wedding next year. He wants to invite her and his dad (they divorced when he was 12). His dad is a functioning alcoholic and actually really nice guy, and becomes a clown when drunk.

His mum is awful. We are having a pagan handfasting in a goddess temple and she is a devout Christian. We are getting married on the 13th, which is a sacred feminine number (13 moon cycles and women have 13 periods a year) she is highly superstitious and is terrified of Friday 13th (which is actually a sacred goddess day) she doesnt know we are pagans.

Even if she takes that pretty well, I have anxiety issues due to abusive childhood. His mother triggers me very badly.

He wants her there, I dont. I dont know how to tell him. Should I just suck it up? How do I make everyone happy? How do i not upset SO?"
444,"I’ve tagged this as ambivalent about advice. I don’t mind advice at all but please be gentle. 

SO is a wonderful person and is way too kind for his own good, which makes him have a bit of a noodle spine. Please be gentle with regard to him, there’s a lot going on that I can’t share because it’s identifying. He’s doing his best with a bad deal. 

So. Onto the actual event that brought me here. MIL wants SIL to come live with us. SIL is SO’s younger sister and has major issues. She is 30 years old and has never maintained a job for longer than a month or two. She has severe money issues and is in the process of getting evicted. She struggles with some mental health stuff, which is what MIL attributes to her not being able to keep a job. 

MIL called us in the middle of us being out on a date. She knew we were on a date and that we don’t do things like that often and chose to interrupt to severely guild trip us into taking in SIL. She waxed poetic about SIL seeing a new doctor for her mental illness and repeatedly said that SIL is “not the same person she was”. MIL has suggested that SIL move in with us until she gets on her feet. MIL will pay token rent for her and that’s it. 

I am obviously opposed. I don’t think SIL is reliable. I don’t think MIL will pay us. Just last month she messaged us asking for $500 for SIL’s rent, so how is she going to pay us anything when she clearly doesn’t have access to funds? Between that and SIL’s unreliability, I think we’re going to end up with a forever adult dependant. SIL is obviously the GC of this family and MIL is laying the guilt on beyond thick. 

The worst thing is that my SO understands all of my concerns and agrees with them, and wants to do it anyway. He’s been totally brainwashed that it’s his responsibility to make sacrifices for family. But I feel that 1. SIL could move in with MIL if the need is that dire and MIL is willing to pay anyway and 2. If we do this we would just be enabling her to continue the way she is. 

MIL has broached this topic before, but now that we’re in a larger home she is trying this shit AGAIN. She has told my SO that he needs to take care of faaaaaaamily and not be concerned with what I think. SO is scared of putting his sister in a bad situation. And his mother has such a habit of backing us into corners and making us the only option for taking care of people we shouldn’t have to take care of (see post history for more of that). 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting here? How would you guys handle this?"
445,"Basic info: Mom and Dad are still together and I have 2 sisters, one older and one younger, and a brother who is the eldest. So that's 4 kids in total. Three of us, my and my sisters, have not spoken to my mother in months. My brother barely does but he is the apple of her eye.

My mother texted me today asking to meet up for lunch or dinner sometime soon and it's just filled me with a ton of anxiety. My mother is known for writing me and my sisters shitty letters so my husband suggested I write her a letter and send it. My little sister tried this and she didn't even read the letter because of course my mother does no wrong. 

Hopefully someone can relate to this but, I don't even know what I would write. The abuse was very mental and she literally does not understand that some of the things she did growing up was abusive. It's also really hard to think clearly on my childhood because it's just kind of blank? I just have this feeling of total dislike for her. Sometimes I wonder if I imagined it but then I speak to my sisters and they revalidate my thoughts and feelings. 

So in short, do I write a letter and confront her? Something I have NEVER done, or do I just keep ignoring her? To be clear I do not feel like I owe her anything, I am just wondering if anyone thinks it'll be good for me to face her?

Also dumb question, does anyone know of a website I could go to that would ask prompting questions that may help me realize what she did was abuse?"
446,"ILs were over this weekend from out of state. It was a mostly tame visit and this seems like small potatoes but at the same time I feel like it's just them doing their best to not listen to specifically expressed ""boundaries"".

We have a two year old and a 4 month old (2.5 corrected). My son was a preemie and although perfectly fine this means we still are cautious of germs. The Drs told us stop wearing shoes in the house, always wash hands upon entering your home. So we have made that standard practice. 

My ILs arrive and my DH is like hey can you all take off your shoes and I swear it's like pulling teeth. They aren't up in arms just act sort of oblivious. And everything is ""oh haha okie dokie""-mil. Take off your damn flip flops how hard is it? Anyways this went on over and over throughout the visit. They'd come over and one of them would ""forget"" and walk onto our home. Like my DH would meet them at the door and mil would be walking into the kitchen with shoes on so I'd say hey can you take off your shoes and I swear I'm like ignored and DH is calling from behind to take off her shoes also. 

So same with washing hands. My DH has to remind mil over and over. Like hey Mom wash your hands...no, wash your hands, please wash your hands before it like registers or she would do it. And she like auto grabbed at the baby without washing first. Then fil will wash his hands, grab a dog toy, rough house the dog, and touch my toddlers face.

All the way up to the very last five minutes of their stay my fil runs out to his car to grab something and then comes back in all the way into the living room with his flip flops on. I'm just seething because I don't know how it was unintentional but like don't say anything they are finally leaving.

Anyways it seems so little, and maybe germaphobic, but it's Dr recommendation and because we have a preemie! You think they'd take it seriously but they are of the generation ""well we ate dirt and we're healthy as oxes"".  I have been simmering on this and honestly can't tell if it was just they are that absentminded (not when it's stuff mil wants like pictures, that sure got remembered) or just don't like being told what to do and this was some silent rebellion. Honestly it was so many times I don't see how you forget something that simple repeatedly, and it's my kids health the grandkids mil is so obsessed with youd think that'd be enough. But Fil even reminded mil to take off her shoes one instance.

Thankfully we have NO plans to see them for months I'm just bothered even simple things can't be respected.

Edit to add, mil even said one time ""I washed my hands right before leaving the hotel."" And my DH was like ""great did you touch *anything* on the way over?... Wash your hands"". Like I don't know if that's just genuine ignorance or willful obliviousness or intentional. And why is it even an issue? Like why does she put up that argument instead of just washing her hands. She used to do this with my first also. The hand washing rule is old, shoe rule is new. And now that I think of it she used to be like well is sanitizing ok? Which in a pinch sure but why can't you just *wash your hands*?"
447,"I've written on this sub once before and had a lot of validation from all of you wonderful people. Sooo.. I'm here again to gain a little more perspective. Everything had been going pretty well as I had been verrrryyyy LC for quite some time- would only visit like once a month for a couple hours. But recently, contact has picked back up some and now I'm in this mess so here's where I need some help:

A couple weekends ago, I was speaking with JNMIL's best friend at an event we all attended. I really love and appreciate JNMIL's best friend (who FH calls ""aunt"") and we have always gotten along very well- to the point where FH has said on multiple occasions in front of JNMIL that he is so thankful that aunt is there to advocate for me; aunt ALWAYS calls JNMIL out for her behavior. Anyway, in a convo, aunt told me that JNMIL has labelled me as ""cold"" and said ""other not so nice things"" about me- I didn't ask what the other things were bc honestly didn't even want to know. She also, which I already knew, frequently compares me to FSIL (who I really enjoy) and who JNMIL obsesses over; she compares us in the way that FSIL is the angel and I am the devil bc FSIL is a ""yes"" man and I don't go along with anyone's shit when I don't feel like it. Side note: FSIL cannot STAND JNMIL however, to her face is the sweetest person you'll ever meet which drives me up the wall but this is not the place for that convo. Anyway...

I have been lamenting over the word ""cold"" for quite some time now; for some reason that word really bothers me- just call me a bitch and get on with it because if I'm anything, its not a ""cold"" person, I just don't want to associate with you- there's a difference. I don't know whether I should bring this up to JNMIL and have a conversation with her over it or what. I told FH about the incident and he was shocked 1. that his mom said that and 2. that aunt actually told me she said that. FH knows that myself and JNMIL have never had a good relationship and he's never made me feel as though I'm in the wrong- bc he knows I'm not. His advice to me was that I should speak with her about the comment and how I'm feeling- he also told me that he would come with me to do it. But honestly, she's a wicked person and I'm scared (for lack of better term) to bring it up to her bc she does NOT handle confrontation well (think: kicking, screaming, crying- literally). 

So my question is this: should I confront her? Should I even care that she called me ""cold"" amongst other things?"
448,"Well his mother called him and he placed her on speaker phone. She ""apologised"" for all the dirty things she said and done. After the sorry she then informed him of all the wrong hes done. It then just turned into a huge mess of a conversation. Justnomil just wants DH to forgive and forget without real change. The entire conversation where he criticized her actions she then cried about how shes a bad mother and everyone hates her. DH informed her we don't want her stuff she bought and shes not going to play grandma at last minute. Informed her she won't be attending the birth or afterwards and shes got a long road still to go. Thanks again for all the advice from previously, it helped tons!"
449,"Background: SO and I have been together for 15 years. He was living independently and gainfully employed. He took on my 5 year old like a champ and we’ve always worked together on making ends meet. We have never been rich but we got bills paid and kept a roof over our heads. About 5 years ago I had a medical issue that kept me from working for a while. Up to this point MIL had only been mildly annoying like telling me how to parent and giving unsolicited advice. When I got sick she started spreading rumors to our mutual friends that I really was just being lazy and didn’t want to work. 
Then she had to have a knee replacement surgery. She would be in rehab for six to eight weeks and then almost a year of recovery. 
SO thought it would be easier on us to move in with her and help care for her dogs and the house while she was recovering. I wasn’t too keen on this because she is a hoarder and tends to use people’s kindness the pony of stupid, I saw myself getting used in the long run but we were having a tough time with rent and our lease was coming up and was going to increase beyond our budget. My DD who was 16 refused to move in too bc she and MIL butt heads hard. She moved with my parents. I was sad about this but it was better for everyone. Fast forward to that next Christmas and I decided to go home for the holidays because my dad was insistent that the family be together. It was odd but we pulled it off and it was lovely. One week later my father was killed in a car wreck. Obviously this extended my stay and I was a basket case as my father and I were incredibly close. 
When I got home I was in a deep depression and SO was very understanding and took my mood swings in stride. MIL not so much. She made me feel ashamed of my grief and kept trying to make it about her and her needs. I needed to get back into my routine so I felt normal. My “routine” being waiting on her hand and foot as she had taken to camping in her recliner chair and using a commode. Her calling me on my cell when she was hungry in the am for her breakfast and me running all errands and picking up pills and groceries (with our money). I paid all the bills. (Again with our money.) she said it was because she allowed us to live there rent free so she expected us to pay all the bills. At the time SO worked for the state in a mental hospital. He made good money and it was ok. However, he was severely injured by a client and ended up having to have three shoulder surgeries and a back surgery. So now I’m taking care of him as well. But that’s my job. 
One day he hears his mother telling a friend how she “takes her lunch at 1230p” and needs to be home. That was his breaking point and he told her that she either needed to start doing things for herself or get a nurse. 
I had been looking for work for a little while but she had always whines about it and I gave in. This time I didn’t. Honestly I just needed something part time to get out of the house for a bit so I got a job at a local fast food joint. This was two years ago. I am an assistant manager and work appx 45-55hr a week. I’m that time though. It’s all gone to hell. SO has not gone back to work. His workman’s comp is long run out and his $400/mo temp disability runs out end of the year. He has insomnia and he and MIL have NO sleep regulation. They do NOTHING around the house unless I nag and piss. We still pay all the bills and groceries and essentials while she continues to play on Wish and HSN. I tried to claim the third bedroom as a craft room for myself as it wasn’t being used but for piles of useless things. She then decided that she “had to have use of her office” once SO cleaned it out. Refusing to allow me to move my craft desk and sewing machine in. Enough room for us both but no it’s her house and her rules. 
Six months later it’s just filled with her random crap again. 
Tonite she said “I need you to do something in the office and move your stuff out so I can use it” I haven’t had a day off in two weeks due to manager issues at work. 
She’s also complaining that we need to get all our things out of the garage and bedroom ( our bedroom ) because she needs more space. She wants to get rid of her storage units because they are too expensive. I asked her where we’d put it. Our own storage unit is full. “Well you can’t just get another one?”
Sooooo.. I get to pay for an extra storage unit because you don’t want to pay for yours. You want to encroach in my very little space that I don’t even feel like is mine anyway. But I pay all the bills and provide household needs. Yet no one can bring themselves to do dishes or laundry or sweep or mop. 
SO has gotten complacent because I think he is just done. He has to live with two strong willed women who want control of the household and he’s torn. I get it. But god dammit. I wish he would stick up for me once in a while. He used to be very man of the house and tell his mom off when she needed it. 
He even sat down and told her we would pay the power and the internet/streaming services. 
This worked out for three months until the water got turned off and she yelled at me for not paying the bill. One I never saw a bill ( I put power and internet on auto pay when we came to the aforementioned agreement )
And no one ever let me know it was overdue or that she needed help paying it. 
So I paid $550 to get that turned on. 
She claims she never agreed to pay the water and just went back to her old chant of “ I allow you to live her rent free so you need to pay the utilities”
I am able to scrap a small savings together for emergency use. Due to my SO she knows this. So every so often she has an emergency that she need help with. And bullies the money from us just to shut her up. 
I have ended up moving our savings to a separate bank account that only I have access to. 
I shouldn’t have to do that. 
Ok this ended up getting long and drawn out and I’m actually realizing that my MIL is an amateur compared to some of the pieces of work you ladies deal with. 
I feel disrespected and under appreciated. By both SO and MIL at this point. 
Since my father died my mom is alone half the country away and being taken advantage of my my sisters and my DD has moved out and started her life. 
It breaks my heart that I am so utterly stuck in my situation. I have no means to just up and move out. Rents in my city have skyrocketed to the point of impossible on just my job alone. 
Even if I manage to scrap something together for a trip home it’s guilted out of my hands and my biggest fear is being kicked out and having nowhere to go."
450,"I debated posting about this partly because I kind of get the reasoning of it, but at the same time, it annoys me.

Recap: I told MIL that I don't want her babysitting DD after she starts school. MIL had wanted to move close to us wherever that might be even though DD won't start school for at least a year to three years and she and FIL have been going back and forth on selling their current house or updating it.

A couple weeks ago when DH and I were talking about where we want to move, MIL chimed in and said she just has to stay in the area because she can't move away from GMIL (her mom). GMIL is in an assisted living home and has been declining due to lack of physical ability as well as dementia. The dementia has been getting scary and has been progressing for quite some time now. 

Now, it would be perfectly reasonable for MIL to go check on GMIL during the day and visit with her and then go pick up DD after school (were DH and I to allow her and if DD were in school now.) It just really annoyed me that MIL was willing to move upwards of an hour away from GMIL, but once I told her I didn't want her babysitting, suddenly she can't move away from GMIL. Really...?"
451,"Antsy has always been obsessed with surprises. Surprise birthdays, surprise gifts at Christmas, surprise visits... you name it. 

A few years back DH and I moved across the country and Antsy decided to retire across the coast, moving down the street from SisInLaw. Since then, all we've heard is her complain how she can't visit us because we live too far and won't let her visit. The last part is not the truth. In fact, she's out here maybe 4-5 times a year, for weeks at a time. The shortest visit from her was 9 days. Longest? 5 weeks. (FIVEWEEKS)

In fact, she's purchased a one-way ticket before to visit with the ""let's just see where it goes"" mentality. 

The problem is, Antsy can't make any plans in advance and has on multiple occasions, text us that she bought airfare to visit us for the following weekend, day, week; nothing further than 4 days in advance. BECAUSE IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. I would estimate 70% of the time she's had to cancel or reschedule because DH and I have work and couldn't take off, obligations to events or are out of town.

Never once has she checked in to see what our schedule was like or make a plan to visit like an adult. It's always about the element of surprise for her. Which I suppose is great if your'e retired, not working a 9-5 with limited time off, like DH and I. 

The reason I had to vent, was I had a family member plan time to take off and visit us, that was months in the planning, only to have Antsy announce she was coming to visit the same time. We told her she could, but warned her another family member would be staying with us at that same time (we only have one extra room), but she was still welcome. 

Antsy threw a fit, and had a complete cyclone meltdown where she blamed me for taking DH and moving away (I saw that one coming), blamed me for not having a job that offered a more flexible schedule (wow, but still not totally shocked by that), blamed DH and I for using our time off instead of storing it up for these ""surprise visits"" and called me selfish, for planning a visit with my family member when she claims I knew she wanted to visit (in a vaguely unspecified timeframe). 

No advice, I'm just venting and totally exhausted from playing this game every other month. I find it so hard to believe that a grown woman is that self-absorbed and dense that she doesn't realize everyone has their own life and schedule and to respect that. At this point though, the only person speaking to her is DH, as I've refused to get involved anymore, but I still feel bad he has to defend us and I our schedules whenever this comes up."
452,"This takes place a long time ago. I was still innocent and wanted my husband to try because 'family' so after 5 months of our no contact his mother asks us to meet with her. We picked a neutral location at an amazing restaurant. All on our best behavior things were going well  when she dumps this large heavy package on the table.

She explained that since my birthday had passed several months previously during the regrettable period of silence she had brought my birthday present. Feeling flustered I unwrap this huge and very heavy gift just as the waiter is coming with our coffees. The waiter recoiled in horror as I sat there with the ugliest creepiest doll with these staring almost haunted eyes.

The wait staff all took turns to come and peek at the hideous thing, giving us perplexed looks as it sat pride of place on the table. This thing followed us from house to house over the years and it never stopped giving me the creeps. Happily when I went NC 3 years ago the doll got the boot. I didn't even give it to charity but just binned it."
453,"This is an old story but I feel like it's a classic and I want to tell, with some other relevant behaviours from her, just because.

So when DH and I had been together about 3 years, we moved cities for work, moved in together after 2 years long distance and were just plain happy to be together and know our relationship survived!

This time coincided with JNMIL releasing some equity from her house or pension,i don't know, and she wanted her two sons to use it as a deposit to buy houses. Read that to be clear- she decided it was time for them.
At one family gathering she talked through her plans to everyone: 'I'm going to get DS1 to buy his house first, then once we've gone through that, I'll get DS2 (my DH) into a house, and then I'll be happy'.
Yes, then SHE would be happy.
Anyways, how lovely to be helped to buy a house. I'm not complaining about that.

So house hunting started, DH and I are living in a real mix of a town that we are new to, so finding a nice area was difficult and we realised we needed to do some driving around to find the right areas. JNMIL was fervently searching for houses for us on the internet, sending us houses she had found that we should see. She did not take well to bring told that we didn't like the area, but still she would not be put off. She HAD to be involved.
Eventually I decided we just needed to go view houses to see what we could get in our budget across areas. I decided to invite her along so she could feel involved. I made a load of appointments at houses that were not really on the table, but I wanted to see as research and to put our budget and tick list into context. JNMIL came along, not realising/knowing these were not serious contenders.
I then had a game of sport that afternoon, and left DH &amp; JNMIL after all the viewings. I get back and ask DH what he thought of the houses, one was surprisingly ok and I wanted his thoughts. 'We don't think that's the right one for X,y,z reasons' he says.
'who's WE?' I ask.
Him: blank face..
Me: WE haven't discussed anything yet, have WE?
In this moment, I (&amp; he) realise that she assumes complete brain washing control over him whenever she is in the vicinity. Several years on now, I see why, she just talks at people with opinions that she has no right to have, never mind share. And no awareness that she completely bulldozes people.

(Side note, this escapade backfired on me because whenever I saw her for about a year after, she would repeatedly tell me why the houses I chose to look at were all disasters and she knew it and she knew better than my judgement and what a disaster my house viewing choices were....)

So we find a house, annoyingly it is one that she found on the internet, even more annoying is that it is almost exactly the same as the house she lives in. She wants to visit after we move in. She wanted to come down THE DAY WE MOVED IN, but I shut that shit down and told DH to convince her that it would be better if she waited till 2 weeks later when our new bed would be delivered and we would have a spare bed and she could have dinner &amp; stay over (she lives 2 hours away).

So she comes to stay, we give her a tour. She comments the WHOLE time, oh it's just like mine, this is a bit different but you can make it like mine...etc.
We go into garage, my DH massive collection of sports kit (club's, pads, bats, sticks etc without being too specific) are in there. I say I want a shelf at the back of the garage to put his stuff on. She says 'oh no you don't want that, you need hooks and blah blah...'. no filter or awareness that it is not HER HOUSE.
We go inside, we show her our new bed, it's got storage underneath. I say my sport kit is in there (I refer this time to shirts, socks, shorts, but clothing).
Without any further questioning or understanding, she jumps in and snaps at me:
'OH! So YOU make your DH keep his kit in the garage, but YOU can keep YOUR kit in the bedroom.....?'

Errr no, his clothing is also in his storage in his side of the bed, the 'kit' outside in the garage is large, smelly or just plain does not belong inside the house.

Well, there it is. She genuinely thought I was being mean to my DH, that I treat him like a lesser person than myself and he is being made to live in misery because his wife is a self-centred diva that thinks she's more important than him.

Obviously this is not the case. DH and work hard to be fair to each other, he had no issue with his 'kit' bring in the garage- it was one item on the house hunting list that he said was non-negotiable because he needed it for his kit.
Such a bitch, she will always assume that I'm a bitch and treating her precious son badly (he is golden son). She has had no reason to believe that, I assume it's just the conclusion she's come to because there is no other reason that he would choose to move away from her and escape from her emotional marriage to him."
454,"Throw away account to avoid being found out though at this point, this is a cry for help in sense so screw it. I'm on mobile, format, ECT. Sorry.
Tl;dr at end if you don't want to read everything.

To clarify, she's not *technically* my MIL as I am not offically married to her son. She *is* however, a monumental pain in the ass all the same.

Been with S.O for almost 3 years, live together, have a few cats (furr babies) and have a humble and cozy apartment together. We. Are. Happy. 

Until 3 months ago JNMIL called S.O saying that were she was living wasn't working out and needed a place to stay. I was fine with it as we had a pretty decent relationship prior. She moves in and immensely supportive of my struggle with my own mother who at the time was in hospice care. My mother passed away August 24th (...I miss her so much..) and days later JNMIL starts acting strangely. 

I've been well aware of her drug history and she has told me on numerous occasions (she never stops talking about it) she was a user, quit, and is remorseful of what she put her children through during their upbringing, ECT. S.O even told me stories prior to meeting her and over time of talking on the phone, Facebook messenger, and her visits, I thought I knew her after a few years.

Anyway, she starts falling asleep whenever we try to talk to her. We have to repeat ourselves 10 times, says extremely inappropriate comments and asks inappropriate questions, stumbles and wanders around, as she's completely doped out of her mind. When she's not, she's angry, bitter, hostile, critical, and downright antagonistic. This *was not the person I know* and *is someone who using* opiods as they, like most drugs, alter your moods in extremes, especially inbetween highs. 

It began with her wanting to tell me and S.O how to run our home and got extremely nasty when we didn't do as she said. She took this as a slight against her because she ""has life experiences."" and we aren't appreciating it. After she realized she couldn't get a proper reaction from S.O to feed her need for attention, she immediately picked a fight with me when I had done nothing personal to her. This lead to me having to leave the apartment 3 times in one day because everytime she heard me walk in, she would fly out of the guest room talking shit about me in front of me to S.O. It took every bit of self control to not back hand this bitch. I would just turn around and leave again. My S.O spent nearly the entire day screaming at her defending me and had to threaten to kick her out to get her to stop.

Another instance was one night S.O and I were having some ""intimate time"" and since we are in an apartment, privacy is not a luxury as far as sound is concerned. At night, she usually wanders into the kitchen making coffee (and I wake up to 5 full cups of coffee just sitting there) and meanders for a while. The next morning, S.O went to work and I'm just waking up. I turn the corner to the bathroom and she's there. Eyes rolling into the back of her head and wobbling. She **asked me if S.O and I were having sex last night and if she inturupted anything by being in the kitchen. That if we used a condom and hopes I get pregnant if we didn't. Also, how is my dead mother doing?** almost in one breath. I was so disgusted that I just turned around and went back into my bedroom. 

Days later I finally explode on her and tell her she's been out of line and I'm sick of her shit. Sick of her telling S.O that I ""don't want her here"" and ""I'm trying to keep him from her."" That maybe her other children would actually want to talk to her if she wasn't a fucking psycho. Then she had the nerve to toss in the ""I'm his mother, you can't talk to me like that."" nonsense. Told her millions of other women are mothers too. She's not a special snowflake. She's not royalty. JNMIL then decided to throw in my face that *my* mother wasn't perfect either, that she wasn't a saint. **Fucking bitch only met my mom twice. On her death bed. She just died.** So I told JNMIL that my mom compared to her? She *is* a saint, not a drug addled witch who lies to her children. She immediately backed down and tried making nice with me. I told her to fuck off and I left the room. S.O did his best to calm the situation the best he could but after the mother thing? No, she deserved it.

It escalates to a point that a month later, she starts stealing money and blows through all $1,300 she gets a month, what she's suppose to be saving to move out, no bills, no rent, on fucking pills. At this point, before we could confront her as our suspisions were confirmed, she leaves to go to some detox center 2 hours away some point in the night. She comes back a week later, with all her discharge papers and is acting pretty normal. My S.O let's her stay since she made the choice on her own to get clean. Not happy about it but I am supportive. I held out hope she might go back to the person I knew. 

Wrong. A week later, she's back into pills again after she promised she wouldn't, after she said she would attend NA, after we made it clear that we are done with this nonsense. We took her to a another detox center yesterday. I am boiling angry. S.O is angry. But I don't think he understands he's enabling her by not giving her real consequences like actually kicking her out or giving an ultimatum of some sort. He won't throw her out cause she's his mom. I get it but it sucks. 
So in a week or so, we have to figure out how to proceed with her. I told him an extended stay at a locked down rehab center would do wonders. But beyond that, it's not our problem anymore. I told him I'm not interested in a relationship with her at all after this and he felt the same. I know this will bite me in the ass and I'll be blamed as usual but whatever. 

**Tl;dr JNMIL lied about her sobriety, moved in with us, treats me like garbage and villianizes me to S.O to deflect her wrong doing of lying and drug use, steals from us, is way too invested in our relationship, listens to us have sex, says extremely inappropriate and disgusting things to me when S.O isn't around and can't stay sober.**"
455,"Going to try and keep the background short and sweet. 

MIL is an only child so I think a lot of her issues stems from not having a sibling/not having to share (even the holidays) ect. 
She has always been overly pushy about him getting along with his sister. They don't hate each other but have very different lifestyles. Husband has a 8-5 office job, married, we have a child. His sister is a bartender and is a mess imo. 
His sister lives over 1,000 miles away, they have never been super close. 
She only came to visit once a year and it took 2 years for me to meet her.  The 3rd time we hung out was our wedding. (I live 3 hours away from my own family so if I'm going to travel it's not going to be to see his sister, so I get we don't put forth the effort but I've been in nursing school/working as a nurse aka weekends and holidays) 

Now that we have the only grandchild his mom is even more pushy about letting his sister have time with our child.

The current issue: my dad is dying of lung cancer. His mom wants to plan the holidays my husband told her just no, because it's likely my dad's last holidays. (There's been a handful of times that she always says she'll come then she doesn't)

His mom said ""is your sister going to be expected to come to her dad's funeral?"" 

Are we really making my dad dying about his sister? Really?? I don't even want her there. She makes everything about her (ex wearing white pants and no bra to our wedding - she wears a bra to everyone else's wedding and every other occasion) 
I'm just at my breaking point. There's been a lot of ups and downs and I've just dropped everything and bit my tongue. 
Idk if I'm looking to vent or get advice. But I'm just at a loss for words even."
456,"When I was engaged to my now-husband, MIL and I had had a falling out due to her shitty narcissistic attitude where she needed the attention, the babying, the constant desire to fight with people due to her idea that real life was akin to a novela, and so on. She wanted a fanfare all the time, felt she was owed for being a mother and she had this twisted belief that she could abuse and bully younger people just because they were younger and they still had to respect her. She even tried to bully her adult children and tell them the same thing. With me, she thought because I “wasn’t family” that it was okay for her and her other kids to mistreat me until I married her son.

Fast forward to my wedding day. The night before my stupid SIL, the mom’s favorite, had written an ignorant and meddling text letter putting me down. She was also parroting the mom’s bullshit because my MIL wanted my husband to move back home with her, to go get some fancy college degree, and to break up with me and find their idea of a traditional Hispanic rich girl. In the letter, my nosy SIL tried to convince my DH that I had nothing to offer him (I’m not a real estate CEO’s daughter either), that I “disrespected her, their younger [bully] brother, and the mom” by standing my ground and not allowing them to talk down to me or mistreat me so they think it’s “disrespect”, she begged him to reconsider marrying me, to leave his apartment that he was happy in, she was mad at me because she accused me of forcing him to marry me because I chose not to cohabitate with him before marriage (yep I’m totally not traditional lol) just because she lived with all her dudes first. She claimed I was not good enough for him, that he needed someone with more than what I had and that the only reason she was going to our wedding was for him. Her mother said the same thing. Of course at the wedding, I was very distant with her, barely hugged her and tried not to look at her. Oddly enough, I found out some months later she cried to her mom claiming I “made a face at her” and that she felt so hurt because she drove all the way over here to “spend money on us”. What a bunch of kindergarten stupidity.

At the wedding my MIL and FIL never greeted me once. They ignored me the whole time and my MIL had diaper face the whole time...even in the photos she looked like she was at a funeral. Neither of them celebrated our vows and when we finished our vows, she dragged my husband over to her and his father and took a photo with them and left me out. People looked at her like she was being an idiot and she was named La Llorona by the other guests after that. However, a bit of good news - I got a little revenge during the wedding toast when I said, “Thank you to everyone who actually supports us, your presence is a blessing, as for the others, thanks too I guess.” I loved the facial expressions. I will keep those in my heart forever.

Last time I wrote about how I’m in my last pregnancy trimester and MIL has not bothered to show any concern or interest in this baby nor does she accept me to this day as her DIL. She has not bothered to contact me, has not bothered to apologize for her evil ways in the past and the stunts she pulled behind closed doors, she has only tried to contact my husband time to time, and she refuses to ask me anything about the baby so once in a while she will send her two flying monkeys to ask me or my husband questions about her “granddaughter”. 

Nine months is almost here and my baby shower passed. My wonderful family has been super supportive, generous and helpful. This pregnancy was very rough and not easy at all for me and I’m a FTM and I am so thankful my parents and sister and close friends and cousins and aunts and uncles have been there for us. Nothing from She Who Shall Not Be Named or her kin. She still expects me to come chasing her down to bow before her. Not happening.✌🏽

I have already told my DH that the ONLY people allowed to visit me and baby after birth are my parents and two of my friends and only one friend of his that we trust. I don’t want a parade in my delivery room or the recovery stage. I esp don’t want MIL showing up with her entourage because I have already made up my mind that before she even thinks she has a chance to see or hold my child, she has to be open to fixing things MY way now. This is literally my way or the highway, and no one not even DH is going to stop me. MIL has to hear it all from me, and if she doesn’t want to deal with the problems she has helped to cause, then she can fuck right off and out and ride in the Bye Felicia bus. I will be in post partum recovery mode, I don’t and won’t have TIME or energy to be dealing with a scandalosa. I will be too tired, too sore, too grumpy, too milky, too pissy and too busy bonding with my baby to be dealing with such shenanigans.

I have made a list of what things I will be saying and pointing out to her about why things have been this way. Cut to the chase, black and white, she’s either going to be mature and listen and understand or she is going to blow her gasket."
457,"Seeing another users post about newborn photos reminds me of something my MiL did when LO was born (2 months ago.)


We were still in the hospital, they kept us 2 nights, I don’t know why, possibly because we were breast feeding and I was clearly nervous as all hell about it. So it’s day 2 of 3 and my in-laws show up. LO has been born for MAYBE 24hrs, and this is a big maybe, and this woman whips PRINTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY CHILD OUT OF HER PURSE. 


I am shook. 


My D(ear)H looks at me, I look at him, I look at her, I look at the picture (a photo my sister took of LO when she was FRESH and clearly on my chest (we let my sister and my BFF in the room before anyone else,)) and I laugh and laugh and laugh. This woman has printed out of picture of my baby, on my boob, and has been showing it to people, without my permission. We have barely shared photographs of our daughter, some group chat pictures, no FB announcement, our entire families barely know, WE DONT EVEN HAVE PRINTED PHOTOS OF HER YET BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 


She did not get to hold the baby that day."
458,"So...I have FFF..her stepasshole who I am no contact with..I have a wonderful and amazing MIL (husbands bio mom)- now we get to the step-mil( husbands stepmom)..fuck my life.

Think of the movie Cinderella. The evil stepmother the two spoiled evil stepsisters and my DH being Cinderella. All they need is a cat named Lucifer. Thats what I'm dealing with.

So this woman came into my husbands life when he was young maybe 8-10 years old. She married his  father and had two daughters, husband's half sisters. This woman would constantly make his father pick between my DH or her and his daughters. Unfortunately, DH got the shaft and became everyones fix it guy and go to guy because he desperately wanted love and affection from the family. His father passes and instead of DH getting anything of his father..he gets nothing not even pictures of him and his dad which was all he wanted. (Thanks lady)

Cue me and DH getting together and married. This woman tried to make a smear campaign against me to the family and become gate keeper.

Her favorite game was to not tell me (who handles all the family schedules and events) when things were then tell family we were just being assholes  and didn't want to come.

Until I beat her at her own game. One by one I met each family member..I became friends around her. Then next family event I became best friends with the Matriarch so to speak of the family...who now adores me. 

Somehow at the next famile event step-mil tried smear campaign again only to realize while she didn't see us outside at first and started running her mouth- As she is saying we were once again jerks for not showing up (we came early to help cook and set up for the bbq) I walked up behind her and stated.

""Oh you must of been confused, we always want to be at family events
You just never gave us the dates and times..its ok Aunt Will be telling me from now on. Maybe you should get checked out for dementia if you are having such a hard time remembering things""

I put down the tray of food down and walked away. (Pictures of the BBQ shark from this event on my profile)

I play chess not checkers, queen I win.

But seriously, this woman tried the whole time to run me out of conversations- so I just stepped physically in front of her and continued my conversation with a smile. 

Now the holidays are coming up and its already starting.

Let the games begin."
459,"We are currently NC with MIL but my husband doesn't block his mom just mutes her texts and ignores calls (which she rarely calls, she's braver over texts). 

Anyway, my ILs are pretty recently divorced and my FIL started dating very quickly. I honestly don't think he was cheating on her I just think he was emotionally not involved in their marriage at all for the past years and didn't have to have that healing period after the divorce. 

My MIL has been keeping tabs on my FIL through mutual friends and collecting info and she of course found out about FILs girlfriend and she sent my poor DH a slew of messages asking if his dad is seeing someone, trying to get info, then saying she knows hes dating and then tells him not to let his new girlfriend at our house. 

My MIL is not welcome in our home... and yet she thinks she can dictate who we do or don't let walk through our doors?? 

Its just blows my mind. She has no shame."
460,"Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve updated. There’s been a lot going on so there might be a few more updates if this gets long. I’m calling this a success since WaM is moving out. Whoever said that there wouldn’t be less problems just because she’s not living with us was 100% right. 

The good news is that WaM is moving out! The funny thing, is how we got to this point. 

So DH and I had been discussing when we were going to ask WaM to move out. I was trying to solidify a hard date, while DH wanted to give a ballpark. He’s got a noodle spine that I’m trying to get him to shine up but that’s a different story. 

WaM talks to my mom quite a bit and she told my mom almost a month before she told us that she was moving out. WaM essentially complained that we were rejecting her boyfriend (ie I set a boundary she didn’t like) and she wished we had a relaxing vacation (you really thought taking your son, DIL, and a 2 year old on a cruise would be relaxing? *insert eye roll you can see from space*).  The vacation was also planned way before all the new issues came up or else I wouldn’t have agreed to it. My mom said to her something to the effect of, “LO is two. What did you expect when taking him on vacation? LO needs naps and it’s a new environment. It’s not gonna be a cake walk. Also, I haven’t talked to your son but I’m sure he’s feeling hurt you just up and left without a word for this guy. They have had to scramble to find child care and take care of things that were your responsibility at home with no warning. You’ve brought him and his kids around LO without talking to the parents first and they have told you they aren’t comfortable yet. It seems like there might be hurt feelings all around.” WaM was floored by this and didn’t say much. Just “yeah I guess”, grabbed some clothes, and then left. 

About a month later she tells me she is planning to move out (this was about a week or 2 ago). I promptly offer DH and his truck to help move ALL of her shit out. I made that part clear. So this weekend or next she and all of her crap will be out. I’ve been boxing up stuff from the kitchen that is hers and putting all sorts of things in her room that are hers. 

The funny thing. She still hasn’t explicitly stated to DH that she is moving out. We also got a past due notice for a bill she’s supposed to be responsible for this week. I’m going to push to have her pay it, but DH has a noodle spine so I’m not sure it’ll actually happen. 

I think that’s all I will give for an update today. I have 2 more updates that will probably be separate posts. The first is that we met the boyfriend (surprise! He’s a douch bag), and the second will be about therapy where our therapist calls DH out on trying to cater to WaM and calls WaM toxic and manipulative (that’s gonna be a good one). 

Have a lovely day internet friends."

Back to the story 

The week of the party rolls around and MIL took off work because she “just has so much to do for the party.” Despite all this work she claims to have, offers from my side to help are again turned down. At this point my parents assume that MIL is the hostess so if she wants to do things her own way she can do that, and while they will continue be available to help they’re not going to beg to be included. So my parents make arrangements to drop supplies off throughout the week. I am mostly left out of this because of distance and some  rough pregnancy symptoms. From my perspective things seemed uneventful.

On the day of the party SO and I arrive early so he can help set up tables and other heavy lifting type stuff. We get to their house in the morning. MIL was casually hanging out in the garage with her best friend, AuntBFF. Quick word about AuntBFF, SO and I are not huge fans of hers. She’s overly nice in the sort of way that feels fake. She and MIL had only become friends over the last 2-3 years but quickly became pretty enmeshed in each other’s lives; meaning AuntBFF tends to act overly familiar with SO and I despite us hardly knowing her. She wants to be that friend of the family who is like an aunt but without actually having that history. 

Anyway, they’re smoking and I’m pregnant with nausea that won’t quit and a lot of sensitivity to strong smells. Both MIL and AuntBFF rush me for hugs and to rub my belly (without asking). No “how are you, it’s nice to see you OP,” just “omg look at how pregnant you are!” and “there’s my grand baby!” I was overwhelmed by the stale tobacco smell but I put on my polite face before heading inside to escape the second and third hand smoke. 

Once they come back inside MIL and her side kick started running around cleaning, and prepping food. I offered to help but I’m shot down. Okay, I decide to play the pregnancy card and lay down in SO’s old room to avoid crashing before the guests arrive. 

Being pregnant and miserable I end up falling asleep for a little over an hour and wake up about 2 hours before the party. I overhear AuntBFF asking MIL where my parents are. MIL responds in a not so nice tone with a short “picking some things up.” This bothered me because MIL knew my mom offered to drive separately so she could arrive early like us and help set up while my dad did the last minute errand running. However, after MIL had been turning down her assistance all month my mom decided to just ride with my dad instead of having two cars at the party. While I was annoyed by MIL’s tone and attitude towards my family, at this point I was still trying to avoid conflict and just wanted to enjoy the party as well as my pregnant self could. 

When I came out of the bedroom and went to the kitchen I see MIL frantically stirring large crock pots of pulled pork and cussing under her breath. Apparently the meat that she had been cooking and freezing during the weeks leading up to the party was not heating up quickly enough. I offer to help, but again I’m told she doesn’t need assistance. So I decide to get ready to greet guests.

I took a quick shower, did my hair and make up in about 30-45 minutes total. When I’m finished I see that some of MIL’s other friends and family have arrived and they’re helping set up and prep more food. I asked MIL if there is anything I can do and she says she just needs me to be ready to greet guests, (having just done my hair and make up that comment was a little insulting.) At this point I felt silly standing around the house doing nothing while everyone around me was busy preparing things, so I decided to walk to the lake to find SO. 

Down at the lake SO and JYFIL have the tables set up, and they’re chatting/hiding while waiting to be assigned to their next task. Things are quiet down there and very enjoyable. My parents arrived and start helping to take things down to the pavilion and set up plates, coolers, Ice, and some of the food they brought. 

When guests start showing I do my best to greet everyone, making a specific point to introduce myself to SO’s side including the friends of my in-laws. I say introduce myself because MIL is no where to be found, still at the house stirring pulled pork I assumed. Luckily there were some chips and dips down there that my mom and I open up and drinks are being enjoyed, but no meal in sight. An hour after the party started people are getting hungry, they were expecting a 2pm picnic lunch after all. I ask my mother to go back up to the house to check on MIL, AuntBFF and the food. She quickly returns and tells me that MIL says it’s almost ready and told my mom she could go back down to the party.

Finally two hours after the picnic started lunch is served, at 4pm. While I was slightly annoyed I was more relieved to be able to eat and feed the hungry guests. MIL finally joined the rest of us and proceeds to start drinking with her friends. 

I didn’t speak to her a whole lot during the rest of the party because I was so busy with the guests.  I figured she earned a good time so I decided against asking her what was up with the delayed food. MIL and her friends got tipsy and I was later told that a few of my friends heard some less than desirable language, (racists crap I will not repeat) coming from the MIL &amp; friends’ tables. While no one heard MIL say anything negative it was definitely coming from her invited guests. I was pretty angry when I heard about that because we did have some guests of different races invited and present (some of them children). Thankfully I don’t think any of them heard this. 

There were just a couple BEC moments I was part of during the few times I did speak with MIL during the reception (after she joined the party and started drinking). Each time she and I ended up near each other she managed to turn the discussion back to “her grand baby,” no matter who I was talking to at the time or what we were talking about. Also as the party was winding down and I was saying goodbyes and thanking people for coming MIL made several awkward comments to quite a few people that I barely knew about kissing her grand baby, ( ie my pregnant belly), goodbye before they left. Luckily no one took her up on the idea. 

Overall I thought the party was a success, despite the food being late. My guests all said the property was beautiful and that they had a great time. SO and I spent the night at the in-laws to avoid driving back into town late at night. My parents went home, but returned to the IL’s the next morning to help clean up. I thanked MIL for hosting as did my own parents. Then we all went home. 

SO and I opened our gifts at our house and placed an online order for thank you notes that very weekend.

I attempted to move on with life thinking that was the end of the party drama. However this wouldn’t be a JNMIL story if there wasn’t more BEC and JN behavior yet to come. 

Next chapter: MIL and thank you note etiquette"
462,"My mother in law is a bully, plain and simple. After I had my first and only child a few years ago, she seemed to think the baby was hers (she literally told me this after refusing to respect our wishes of having three weeks of no visitors after our son was born. She said ""he's not just yours, he's ours too ). When it become clear that her expectations about her role as grandmother did not match our own, she resorted to passive aggressive bullying, smear campaigns, blame shifting, victimization, and she intentionally violated boundaries of ours
when left to babysit. We tried temporarily  cutting them off for 6 or so months but that basically dismantled my husband's entire family and the flying monkeys started swarming in. 

We think that maybe at this point, giving her SOME limited supervised contact (on neutral territory) with our son may be less stressful than cutting her off completely and dismantling the entire family. However, I do not want her to have an emotionally close relationship with my son because I have no doubt that at some point down the road, she will try and drive a wedge in his relationship with me (in the same way she tried to do in my marriage). 

So my question is this: how much contact should we establish while also keeping her from developing a real relationship with our son? Maybe one day every 4 months with a few video chats spread out over the year? Or is that too much? Should we just limit all her contact to video chats and if so, how often should we video chat per year? I need input."
463,"This weekend was my gf (F, 31) and my (F,24) 5th dating anniversary. We currently live together and so does her mom. It’s a non negotiable thing and we have had countless arguments because of it. I am trying to be okay with it because I choose her over anything or any situation. I only asked that this weekend maybe her mom could go to my gf’s sisters place. Initially that was the plan. And now tonight my gf said her mom doesn’t want to anymore because she has to “finish” up some work here at home. 
This woman does not have a life outside of home and work. 
I thought we could get one weekend to ourselves here at home. 
My gf said we could go to a hotel. Why should I have to pay 150$ just to have some alone time with her? 
I am so upset right now that I can’t stop crying. I feel suffocated. I just feel ANGER. especially because I also had a conversation with her mom stating how excited I was for this weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. 
I feel hurt. She couldn’t make my one wish happen for me. 
Just wanted to share here because I didn’t know where else to."
464,"For background, my son was born at the end of September and right after he was born (l mean before my epidural had worn off), my jnmil told me:;""Well, he doesn't need *you* anymore. Anyone would be a better mother to this child than you."" So, yeah.
Anyhow, I'm in Canada, so our Thanksgiving is in early October. So, probably the week after my son was born, we went to my in-laws house for Thanksgiving. Just as the meal was being put out, I had to feed my son. I went into the guest bedroom and shut (and locked) the door because I wanted privacy and to give him an opportunity to actually eat since every time I tried up until then because jnmil would snatch him from me. I finally got him figured out and eating and he kept drifting off to sleep then being startled awake by these loud bangs and he would start suckling again. All told, I was in the room maybe half an hour. When I came out, the entire meal had been packed away in the fridge. My husband was finishing his plate and was like, ""oh did you want a plate?"" I burst into tears, strapped my son in his car seat and left.
I had forgotten about that, but remembered it this weekend."
465,"Old story so no advice wanted for this specific incident, but if anybody has anything they want to say for if/when DH is looking for or gets a new job, then feel free to comment.

DH is a teacher. He busted his ass *hard* to get good grades so that he could get a job because it's a *highly* competitive field, at least in our area. He prefers subject A, but also has certifications to teach subjects B and C. He absolutely loves subject A and it takes up a lot of his time. Almost all of his books and a good number of his favorite movies revolve around subject A. WIR could care less about subject A. In fact, she could care less about what DH does for a living *period* or what his hobbies and interests are *period*. That is, unless she can make fun of him for them, which she does. Which is why he gray rocks her. He still needs to work on what he gray rocks (i.e., he tells her too much that she shouldn't know, but she couldn't tell you anything about him other than his job and what his favorite hobby was when he was a teenager (it's Pokemon)), but he's pretty good at it for the most part.

When DH was looking for jobs, WIR kept pushing him to get a job in a drive-able distance from her house. Like *really* pushing him. She went as far as to tell him that she didn't care what the better jobs were in other areas, he would have it easier if he lived with her (read: *she* would have it easier because she wouldn't have to keep up her house herself and she could continue to dump it on him, but under the guise of him saving money). When he had an interview two hours away, she *had* to drive him. I offered to take the day off and go with him, but she wouldn't have it. *She* had to be the one to take him. The whole drive up she complained about how long it was taking, and the whole drive back she kept asking him if he would *really* want to live that far away because he'd have to pay to do his laundry instead of just bringing it home and some other bullshit excuses. The job ended up not being filled anyway because the school got word soon after the interview that it was going to need to close. Just an all-around weird situation, but WIR celebrated nonetheless. Meanwhile DH is starting to feel very broken because he can't find a job to hire him despite his stellar resumee and broad knowledge of subject A and how to teach it.

A job opened up in the district where WIR went to school. She pushed him to apply for it, and he did. He didn't do it because of her nagging, but rather because he liked the school and the staff. They ended up hiring someone else, which made DH furious, but he kept applying for jobs at other schools. At least once a week, I remember WIR asking him if he had applied to her school again yet. ""No mom, they don't have any jobs open."" ""Well you should apply anyway! It's so close and eventually they'll have to hire somebody!"" Yeah, teaching doesn't work like that. There are like five positions in each subject (small, small school) and about 50+ minimum applying to those jobs.

A job opened up at another school nearby. He applied out of necessity, but he really didn't want it because the school was and is *awful*. Like, ""pushes an illiterate kid through the grades so they don't have to deal with him"" awful. Like, ""did away with all of their electives like woodshop and art class because the football team needs new uniforms and that's more important"" awful. He felt so relieved when they didn't hire him, but WIR was pissed because she'd been pulling whatever strings she thought she had in that school to pull. I don't know how she believed for a second that talking him up t the lunch ladies and secretaries she knew would do anything, but hey, she tried.

DH ended up getting hired in his current school, and WIR was happy as a clam that it was within driving distance. ""Driving distance"" meant an hour drive each way and his alarm was going off at 4am, but he was still at home. He would drive an hour home every afternoon, and almost every day, she was having him stop on the way home to pick something up for her. It was so often, in fact, that I began to suspect that she was purposely leaving stuff off her list so she could call him and make him pick up whatever it was she voluntold him to. It was never a ""hey could you stop and get X for me at Walton Store?"" It was more like ""hey I forgot X when I went to Walton Store yesterday. Grab it on the way home. I'll pay you back."" Poor DH was stopping at Walton Store at least three days a week. Then he'd come home exhausted and starving and wasn't even allowed to sit down before she gave him a honey-do list one item at a time. It didn't matter if I was there trying to visit him, he had a honey-do list and if I wanted time with him then I had to follow him around while he did the list. Once she got home from work herself, the honey-do list would get longer. By the time the list was done and she was out doing whatever wherever because she didn't have anything to do herself, he was so exhausted that he just wanted to dive into a book about subject A. I would try to show him apartment listings, but he was so exhausted and in need of two minutes to himself that he didn't even want to look at them. I don't hold that against him and don't consider it JustNo behavior. He was so starved for me-time that he couldn't even have given much time to me at that point. Because of all of her barging in on what conversations we did have together, we barely even knew how to communicate with each other.

We ended up finding an apartment and moving in three months after school started. It was this beautiful honeymoon phase where we were finally able to talk and laugh and have sex like we hadn't been able to in the 16 months since I graduated from college and moved home. WIR had *massive* CBF when he told her we found an apartment and would be moving in on X date. She tried telling him that he would have more money to move in a year or over the summer. He should just stay home and save some more. He told me he'd have to think about it (this was JustNo behavior) and then came back and said he wanted to do it. But it didn't stop WIR from trying to arrange our apartment. He got all of his stuff there from WIR's house without me because I had to wait for my dad's pickup truck for my own stuff, so I was later. I got there and everything was arranged already. I had to move some things to fit my things, like I had to push the bed over so I would have more than a foot and a half on my side of the bed and I could put my night stand. I had to push the couch over to fit my bookshelf. I had to move the kitchen table next to the wall because it was blocking my path for me to move my own stuff in. I even had to rearrange the freezer because she put a bunch of food in it (that we were very grateful for) and it was taking up the entire freezer. Once I rearranged it, it only took up half.

She's visited less than five times in three years. She doesn't consider the drive to see us to be ""a reasonable driving distance."" This after she tried to convince DH to drive it every day for a year while she ran him ragged and he could barely function once she was done with him for the night.

TL;DR WIR tried picking the school where DH would work for him and tried pulling her strings (that weren't even tied to anything) so he could get a job in a shitty school and wouldn't have to move away from her. She gave him honey-do list a mile long every night so he could barely spend time with me once he was home after his hour-long commute. CBF ensued when he announced he'd be moving in with me near his job when he finally got one, and she tried talking him out of it because ""it wasn't a long drive and he could stay home and save up until next summer."" Arranged his furniture in our apartment however the hell she pleased, which ended up getting rearranged because it was really inconvenient for me and my stuff--you know, the other person living here and paying rent! And has barely visited us in three years of living together because the drive, that she told DH he should do every day, is too far for her to manage more often than that. Although that last part is working like a dream for me."
466,"DH and his therapist have decided on how he wants to proceed. We are going NC until after the holidays and then the situation will be re-evaluated based on their ability to respect my husband’s boundaries. My money is on them going bananas when they figure out they aren’t invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I feel like I *should* feel bad about being relieved that for once in a decade I can enjoy holidays without them being horrible the whole time. But it feels so good!"
467,"Ok so I know I can just put him in child support legally. But the thing is I don't want him to have my child on the weekend neither and I know thats how the courts work. So far, he's been giving me money under the table but I barely go visit him with my child because he's always out with his friends preferbly than being with me. But his stupid Mom gets in the way and calls me to demand why I didn't go last Saturday to her house because they threw a bbq and basically she wanted me to bring my son so everyone can see him. (They live together). Thing is I HATE going there. Because my ex treated me so horribly and so did his Mom. They only semi accept me now because I had their son's baby. So I told her look, I appreciate you inviting me, but me and your son are not together and I don't feel good going over. Then she said ""well, he gives you money though, so what's the problem?"". Which is true he does. But only like $250 a month. I know if I go to court, he would probably be able to get my son every other weekend and I don't want that. I rather have less money then to share custody. He is the type that would leave my son with his Mom, and go out to party. She is controlling. But she's throwing the money situation in my face. Which is true, if he is offering me money, I should go sometimes to show off the baby, but I hate going there and my other alternative, if she gets tired of me not going, is if she forces her son to seek legal custody. Which I would hate because then for sure for sure my son would have to visit every other weekend and without me. What do I do? Why is this so hard? He really doesn't care that much if he sees his son on the weekend. I told him he can visit here, and he said no he hates my Mom. Well, I hate his Mom too so why do I have to budge?"
468,"Stupid Bitch is my JNmother, she plays at being stupid but is really just a bitch. This story is old as dirt, but feel free to have your say. 

tw:sadism

As I've said in other posts &amp; comments, part of why I had a hard time seeing SB's abuse for what was is because she let other people do the dirty work for her. Oh sure, SHE didn't hit me, but never stopped my father from doing it. This is another one of those abuse by proxy situations. I wanted to write it out for therapeutic reasons after reading about all other sorts of medical themed sadism in the comments of another post. 

~*~*~*~
So when I was very young, my parents &amp; us kids all went to the same doctor. His office was in this narrow building with rooms on both sides (offices on the right, exam rooms on the left). I have very few clear memories from that time because of how abusive my past was, but I know we often went (as a family) to the doctor's office. And for whatever reason, my parents would sit and hang out with him chatting for HOURS. And I mean hours. Now my jnfather had ADHD and he didn't know time management to save his life, so that could be part of it. I really don't know why though. So we'd be there till after dark sometimes. And me and my sister would just wander around the empty building because it was the late 80's and there were not TVs or anything and all the books were medical books. If we stayed late enough the building's custodian-type person would show up. He was a very scruffy European dude, with a scruffy voice and a deep accent. Nothing wrong with that, but to a timid and alone ~7yr old he wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be around. He was scary to me, easy enough to understand.

I really don't know what his whole job was, only that he changed the garbage. Now, this Garbage Man was not a very nice dude. He had these massive, industrial sized black garbage bags that he used to change the garbage. I was a really tiny kid so it is hard to say how big they actually were, but compared to me they were massive. And he'd open them up and chase me around the building. The whole time calling after me, ""You want to get in the garbage bag, Little Girl?"". 

Needless to say I was terrified. Who wouldn't be? I would run, screaming and begging for help.

BOTH MY PARENTS AND THAT STUPID, USELESS DOCTOR WOULD LAUGH AT ME! And of course the Garbage Man thought it was fuckin' hilarious, too.

It happened every time we were there that late, and that happened pretty often. I would curl up and hide under the waiting room chairs and scream. But no one ever came. No one ever comforted me. And just writing this out, it's like I'm back there and I can feel that terror again. And I'll never understand why they did it. I can sort of chalk up my parents' bad behavior to their overall abuse arch, but the doctor? The cleaning guy? What did they get out of it?

My mother of course, the dirty double-dipper, loved to retell stories like this. She always wrote herself as the innocent party...but she never did anything to stop it. Even in her 'virtuous' retellings. Stupid Fucking Bitch. 

I've got a therapist, we're workin' through stuff like this. I'm hella damaged, but I do what I can. Writing stuff out here and sharing experiences with you guys helps a lot."
469,"I just had my third child (second with DH) about two months ago.  The JN issues I experienced with my second child (another account) were largely resolved after NC and things are mostly good with some tiptoeing. 

Anyway..  I paid for newborn photos to be done when my baby was two weeks old.  The photographer I use is fantastic and while less costly than most others for this kind of session it is still something that cost hundreds of dollars. 

After the session it takes several weeks for the editing to be completed but the photographer finishes a small sample and shares them within a few days as a preview with a watermark of her logo on them.

Excited when I saw the first few photos, I shared them with my husband who then shared them with his mother.   No big deal. 

I just got a text from my MIL last night. She sent me pics a physical print of some of these previews and told me she had an 8x10 printed of one of them and 4x6s of the others.  I imagine she is going to frame the 8x10 and hang it on her wall.

She told me, “Now I have nice pictures of my grandchildren.”

No, I hadn’t shared the photos with her. But here’s the thing: I haven’t even purchased them yet as I’m waiting for the editing to be completed first!  They all still have the watermark on them!  There goes my plan of doing that for a Christmas gift. 

I don’t know if she’s clueless about the photos having a watermark on them.   I don’t know if she doesn’t understand that the photos won’t have the watermark when they are finished and released by the photographer. I don’t know if her ordering prints was passive aggressive on her part due to not understanding that the reason why she didn’t have a copy was because they just aren’t ready yet.  

And while a huge part of me no longer has any desire to gift her one or give her access to the digital copies, what on earth will people think when they visit her house and see that picture of my children, her grandchildren, with the watermark?  Is she clueless or a master manipulator now with “proof” of how horrible I am since she doesn’t even have a real copy of the photo?

I told her that I was still waiting for them to be finished and that there will be even more photos available from the session. I don’t know if she understood or just thinks I was keeping them from her.  Or maybe she didn’t think anything negative of me at all, I don’t know. But I just asked her why she didn’t wait for the prints to be released because that’s when the watermark will be removed. She hasn’t had a chance to respond yet so I’m not sure how that will go over but I’m really at a loss and kind of confused about this whole situation I might be overthinking."
470,"I have made this into bullet points so I can cover everything going on.  I'll get to my point at the bottom but this is a long post so I apologize now for the length.

* SO and I have been together two years.  Over these two years MIL was great and not the relationship is non-existent.  MIL constantly guilt trips SO about everything.  He is an adult and they expect him to do chores like a 15 year old. 
* Over those two years I noticed MIL was very mean towards her three sons and husband.  SO and I spoke about when we have kids that her behaviour needs to stop.  I stated that if he spoke to her and the situation was not resolved I would then speak up and handle the situation on my own.  I have still exercised EXTREME patience.  
* In the beginning of my pregnancy I experienced some medical complications that MIL decided to post on her FB profile.  SO spoke to her and she refused to even acknowledge me, or apologize when we attended her house later that week.  I asked her to sit down and explain to my why she thought her behaviour is acceptable or why she felt the need to disclose my private medical information to people in a public forum.  She cried and said she was sorry, I asked her to stop crying and speak to me with respect as she clearly had none for myself or my privacy.  I asked she keep my private medical information to herself moving forward.  SO and I decided privately to keep her on the minimum for information moving forward.  
* We found out we were pregnant with high risk twins later in the same pregnancy and made the decision in June to move closer to an appropriate hospital and my family.  The hospital being the main choice for the move, my family being in the same city was a bonus.   
* MIL decided to throw a temper tantrum in July at our Gender Reveal , due to lack of attention.  SO spoke to her and she said she didn't think her behaviour was inappropriate.  I let it go and decided to see how she acted at our baby showers in August.   SO heavily debated inviting her even to the baby shower on my side in the city we currently live in, my own mother said she should get invited as she is the grandma (not aware of MIL's behaviour).   
MIL then tried to make several excuses why she couldn't go and every time SO, BIL and I all saw right through them and I attempted to personally reach out to her and explain that she would not be judged or excluded from the shower activities.     
Both showers went along with little to no issues and BIL stated he spoke with MIL prior to the one that she had to travel for about being on her best behaviour.  
* I was admitted to hospital for monitoring and have been here for 6 weeks.  MIL has not been in contact at all regarding the twins, myself or SO.  
* Last week (week 30) MIL decided she had a right to know the birth plan.  I discussed with SO if he felt comfortable sharing our birth plan.  He said sure because it's very straight forward and there is no issues with someone waltzing into the OR where the planned C-Section is happening or into the NICU where our babies are planning on being following the birth as I am delivering prior to 34 weeks.    
The OR and NICU are secured areas of the hospital and the staff has been aware of the situation I am currently in with MIL and how her behaviour makes me uncomfortable.
* Currently MIL is now freaking out saying I hate her (I don't) and how I do not want her apart of my birthing plan (not really a spot for her) and how I refuse to allow her alone with the twins (SO made said choice based on past actions and her treatment of him and his two brothers).  MIL is relentless over the last 48 hours, harassing SO with numerous text messages regarding myself and our children.  When they did speak on the phone she cried and threw a temper tantrum and SO just hung up on her after an hour listening to her attempting to cause drama.  
* BIL has also stated he will speak to MIL regarding her behaviour towards me specifically.    
* I have spent the last two mornings speaking with SO trying to keep his mental well being in check. Something that is now normal regarding his interactions with MIL.   

My questions are after everything she has done; 

\- Is it enough for me to go no contact with this woman and keep her from my children for their safety and mental well being?   
\- Is it inappropriate for myself to ask her to apologize for her behaviour?   
\- At what point should SO decide to step back from the relationship for his own mental well being as well?"
471,"Half Rotten Peach is returning. My husband told me last night that his mother let him know that she’s coming into town this sat and because she’ll be driving three hours, she’s going to need to stay the night. He then hesitantly asked me “if the spare room was going to be ready?”  I said a prompt nope and that she would have to stay with his sister. His father and I have been busy building outdoor shelters for the animals when the weather permits, so it isn’t like I’ve been sitting on my butt. He then said his mother mentioned she spoke to me, and I said yes. She wanted to thank me for taking care of you when you had your wisdom teeth out. She also said that she must have misremembered how bad the pain was when her wisdom teeth were taking out due to pain meds. 🤦🏼‍♀️ why do people thank you for taking care of your spouse? I find it weird and patronizing"
472,"This happened a long time ago....

I typed success because these stories all ultimately have a happy ending. This is the Lady Tremayne saga...
My father is passed but if he were alive, he would be posting about my moms step mom...his SMIL.
I kinda binged the story earlier but deleted it because it deserves its own individual posts.

My real grandma died when I was 7 and then 2 years later my grandpa was remarried to this gem...
I didn't have a problem with her till I was 18 and I couldn't understand why my parents had such a problem with her until Lady Tremayne and my JYGP came out for my HS graduation.

In 2003 there was a tv show that was casting makeovers off the street and in the first season, was when we were approached on Mill ave in Tempe AZ.
We just finished lunch and were crossing the street when this fancy looking guy and his camera surrounded my mom like bees. They wanted her to be a part if their first season and listen up, my mom is gorgeous on her own, maybe a little dated in what she wears but gorgeous lady...
In a bout of ""hiss and fit"" Lady Tremayne makes some unintelligible noise and turns around and stomps off in the other direction. My mom was embarrassed and politely refused the offer from the camera men to tend to bitch face. I was disappointed for my mom to have this awesome moment about her, transition into a whine fest about Lady Tremayne. LT is a very self absorbed, self centered, Narcissist. She has moments of yes but they are few and far between. She spends all her money on jewelry and clothing and pinches pennies to help people, she is a self proclaimed lover of the word of God. ( I know that this behavior isnt an exact representation of what Christian people are.) This is just part of her awful self...i digress...

LT didnt say anything else till later in the day. Myself, was driving her and my JYGP to her nephews house. They are nice people and totally worth their salt. In the car she has the audacity to say in front of myself and JYGP that my mom was an idiot for turning down the street offer  earlier...(then I discovered my 18yo self had a shiny spine in development)
Verbatim:
LT:Didn't your mom want to be beautiful???!
Me: my mom doesn't need a TV show to be beautiful because she already is.
JYGP: There's more to beauty than what's on the outside LT. You dont need make up and garbage to show your worth.

*drop da mic*

She was silent for the rest of the day."
473,"FTP, LTL

My (31F) SO (32M) is the only serious relationship I've had outside my regular social circle. We used to work together. After I left my old job we got together and recently we moved in together. Since we've been together he's commented on some the dynamics in my friendships and family relationships that I've gotten so used to I forgot they aren't normal. For example, a friend shouldn't repeatedly bruise you as a joke.

He made a comment about how my mum speaks to me, and it got me thinking about whether she's a little bit JustNo.

I'm not exactly slim or fit, but the other weekend SO and I went for (what I consider), a reasonable afternoon walk of about 7km. Mum will often badger me to exercise more and lose some weight, so I proudly mentioned the walk. She said ""That's just a coffee walk"". As in her and my dad would do that for a stroll before getting coffee. SO thought she was unfair and could have said ""Good for you"" or something instead.

SO mentioned that she isn't very supportive when I share small things I'm proud of, and she often points out that others can easily achieve more in the areas I'm insecure about. Since he's mentioned it, I can think of many instances where she's said something negative when I've been seeking encouragement. Is this something I should worry about?"
474," So two weeks ago my MIL reached out to my husband about getting together for a birthday dinner. On Monday he called her to figure out details, etc. She is a realtor and has a closing in our state which is why she reached out in the first place. Not like she would ever go out of her way to do dinner with her son on his birthday if she didn’t already have a reason to be here. She told my husband that she didn’t know when her closing was yet and it might be at night so she would have to do lunch with him. My job is literally a closing coordinator for a mortgage company. My job is to schedule and perform closings and all things that involve closings. It is what I do. And let me tell you I have never ever had a closing be done at night time. ever. The latest closing I had was 5:30pm. No one does closings at night. I just don’t think she wants to see me because she knows I wouldn’t be at lunch, only my husband would be able to go to lunch with her. She also brought up yet again why I deleted her, which my husband yet again didn’t answer. So clearly she is still upset and fixated on that. 

I just wanted to be able to stand up for myself. I wanted to be able to answer that question to her face and now I don’t think I will be able to. I mean honestly I would rather not see her, but I am still a bit bothered. She knows what she is doing. She isn’t stupid. If she does do lunch with just my husband it will just be her talking about me the whole time. 

While my husband and her were on the phone she also invited us to come for Thanksgiving and my husband quickly shot that down, and told her no we already had plans for thanksgiving. Then she said well you need to come visit at some point during the month of November since your sister will be home from school. Actually no we don’t have to go visit, and I was so proud of my husband because for the first time that I can remember he said no to her twice about two different occasions and told her that we can’t visit because we already have a lot going on in the month of November. 

Anyways. That is my rant for the day. We will see if I actually get to see this clown tomorrow and tell her in person why she is deleted from social media. Will keep you all updated."
475,"Not me but My Grandmother on my dad's side
Character's EG- EG Grandma so this is my moms ex-MIL

So this is how EG is straight up Evil.
 So EG was/is a terrible woman List of SOME of the things she's done not in order of evilness
1) Left my dad in the worst part of their country at 10 years old alone for 5+ years until one of his uncles found him and took him
2) Did many drugs purposely to abort him (he was a result of her sleeping w/my grandfather who was married and rejected her after finding out)
3) When coming to the U.S. she purposely didn't tell him and left him in their home country but took all of his siblings 
4) When he found out and called her she told wished him dead,told him he should have died at the womb,then EG laughed in his face and hung up the phone.
5) When my dad got to the U.S. and got deported she cebrated in church by dancing.
6) When my parents got married (he got a green card) she tried to poison my mom in retaliation.
7) She alienated my brothers and I from the dad's side of the family and we get dirty looks whenever we see them.

EDIT: We do have contact with my uncle and his kids but that's it"
476,"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 2 years. FMIL and I had a falling out a few months ago and haven't spoken since. She thinks I'm controlling and manipulating her son, and she called me a bunch of names and was honestly just cruel. Since then I haven't spoken to her because I really just don't want to. Bf is fine with this and stood his ground and told her what she was doing wasn't ok. Since then we moved in together and he only speaks to/sees her once a week. I feel awful for him, the conversations always end in her wanting him to come around for a family dinner or something family related, her excluding me, and then him getting upset because I'm a part of his family and he doesnt want to just leave me at home. Recently he thinks if I just give a meaningless apology, and she gives one back, we just move on and I won't be excluded from family events and he can have a relationship with her that doesn't involve yelling and arguing 24/7. He said he wants me to do it but only if I'm ok with doing it, and he'll be there with me and if she starts abusing me again we walk and just go back to how things are and I don't have to interact with her anymore. I'm not sure if I want to do this. I don't believe this woman respects me or our relationship, so even if she somehow managed to say sorry (she's never even apologised to her own son) I don't think she'll suddenly just stop insulting me and treat me with respect. He said he's going to speak to her about this, a mutual apology, and see if he can get her to agree to it. I just don't see this going down well at all and I don't want to be in her firing line again. But I'm thinking of giving it a go to show that I'm being the bigger person and tried to apologise. Also if you're wondering ""apologise for what?"".... I'm wondering that too. She's made up all of these awful things I've apparently done and said (twisting my words to an insane degree) and now wants me to say sorry for it... I don't care about giving a fake apology, I don't care what she thinks about me, I just want to make things easier on bf. Any opinions on how to handle this? Or advice from someone who's attempted something similar?"
477,"Long time lurker, first time poster. So MIL is a manipulative and verbally abusive creature who enjoys yelling at my poor old, meek, and feeble FIL. In the 10 years since my DW and I got married and she left the house, MIL has become a hoarder and turned every room of the house into storage for her trash. The poor and soft-spoken FIL is no match for this demon and despite being the only one who works and provides income, FIL has become nothing more than just a speck on the wall in MIL's world as she runs the show and calls all of the shots.

My DW and I finally had a child after years of trying and unfortunately had no choice but to have MIL babysit on occasion. All was well when our child was an infant and slept all day in the crib, but I deemed every room in that house unsafe for a crawling toddler and was nervous when my child finally began to explore his surroundings. The nail in the coffin was the day I found out about the cat ""litter"". MIL is incredibly cheap and thrifty and would go to great lengths to save a penny. She regularly went through the trash of all of her tenants (to recycle the cans and plastic bottles that tenants were mixing with the regular trash).

Ok no big deal I guess as home owners in this area could get fined for having recyclables inside the regular trash. But then I discovered that she was also rummaging through the bathroom trash bags and sorting through them to find ""lightly used toilet paper"" (you know, the ones you wipe with last just to make sure you're all clean down there) MIL was apparently taking these sheets of toilet paper and using them to line the cat litter box because she was too cheap to purchase cat litter. YOU READ RIGHT. My MIL collected USED sheets of toilet paper from the trash of her tenants to use as ""cat litter""!

Needless to say, that was the last day my child stayed at that house and MIL could not understand why. She found nothing wrong with the fact that her 5 cats (mayber 6?) would step all over the used toilet paper and then run off into the house and spread God knows what all over the carpets while my child dragged his body all across the floor. She DEMANDS to my DW that we bring the child back but I have forbidden it until she cleans up her act. My FIL, DW, and SIL are all deathly afraid of her because she incessantly yells and berates them, but MIL fears and avoids me because she once tried doing the same to me and I got in her face and dished it back.  Am I wrong for refusing to allow her to babysit my child in that filthy, disgusting house?

\*EDIT\*  I've been working long hours and do not have time to reddit at work and came home to hundreds of comments! I went through them all and it seems I have left out some details and left you guys with more questions than answers.

Yes I truly believe MIL is mentally ill but she has never been diagnosed because her family just thinks she is weird or quirky. I noticed fairly early on in my relationship with my then-GF and have expressed my concerns to her but she just brushed it off as having a ""weird mom"". I also learned that MIL witnessed her mom commit suicide when she was a young girl and that may be the source of all of her underlying issues. Apparently they were swimming in a river in her birth country and MIL's mom drowned herself by lunging into the deep end when she could not swim. MIL is now in her mid 60s and since that traumatic day, she has not stepped foot in any body of water deeper than her ankles. She would not even dip her feet in a 3 foot deep inflatable pool I set up for the kids for fear of drowning.

Also, the ""cat litter"" is just the tip of the iceberg. MIL always accidentally cuts herself as she is very clumsy around sharp things. I guess this is probably a good time to mention that SHE REUSES BANDAGES. Like blood-soaked bandages. As long as the blood has dried the bandage is fair game for a second go around. I'm not sure how she gets the adhesive to keep sticking for so long."
478,"To set the scene. Living with MIL as our landlord sold our house and due to brexit we're waiting to see what happens before we take on another expensive lease. 

Anyhou, I currently have anaemia due to my endometriosis. I also have chronic IBS so taking tablets is no go. The doctor told me due to the tiredness/fainting etc I need to get my iron levels up quick, so I need to eat nearly raw (blue) lean meat and eating oranges and drinking cold pressed OJ. 

Cool. living with MIL (for Roald Dahl readers she is a vermicious knid ). MIL and her husband live a pretty nice life, 4 + two/three week long holidays a year to expensive locations etc, always out 4-5 times a week with friends. I on the other hand, never shop, charity buy, walk to avoid public transport, never go out, you know the deal, starving artist and I'm frugal.

I need to eat meat like this currently at least 4 times a week. Every-time I cook it, I receive comments like this....

""Oh how the other half live""

""Must be nice to be able to eat steak every-night""

""You should get DH to teach you how to cook something cheaper""

""You should eat spinach instead of steak.""

 Me ""The doctor told me to have some spinach sure, but if I can eat meat, eating lean rare meat with oj is a much faster way to very quickly absorb iron."" MIL ""No but cook a whole bag of spinach"" Me ""I already asked the doctor, they said it won't be enough to get my iron levels up quick enough to avoid getting the shot"" MIL goes on and on, my enjoyment of dinner ruined, eating off a plate in my room to avoid more comments. URGH.

ARGGGHHHHHHH Why would I take the pushy 'advice' of women with only a high school education over a doctor with a medical degree???? She is always trying to make me feel shit about spending money when she is a total spend thrift. 

I HATE HER. How do I politely (She is a awful I don't want to get in an argument, she steamrolls everyone in her way) shut her down. ATM politely saying my doctor recommended steak and oj isn't working.

This is the same woman who pushed me into having a planned miscarriage because of an unviable pregnancy at home in their house instead of the privacy of a hotel like I wanted, and it ended up giving me PTSD.

Also on a BEC note. She is stupid stupid stupid with no manners. It's awful, but I went to a private school and finishing school, so feel like now my resentment of having to have this hob goblin in my life along with his other family is just making me very snobby. I'm not, my friends are from all walks of life but this is bringing something awful out and DH is being really great and shiny spined but I feel terrible I'm always telling him his family are disgusting..... Help me not be an arsehole.... He's improved loads from my being on here and my family are rubbish also, so I need some strategies to not vent and lay it all at his door..."
479,"Guilt trip Nana stuck- “Can you call me?”

Where to begin to unpack...

Tears were launched immediately. A family member (her’s) is on the way out so I expected some, but she had launched her opening salvo into me- “why did I post something on -site name- but I couldn’t respond back to her messages?”

Some guilt trippy lines later and gaps of speech from me- “this isn’t you, what hold does -other-half have on you?” Ooh that made me mad. 

I tried to shine up my spine and gave some sharp retorts but she dug again “you’re different now, everyone notices this (who the f is everyone? They haven’t said anything to me.) Does he read your messages or your emails?” 
And her next gem “I never hurt you as a child and you were never abused as a child so I don’t know where any of this is coming from and if it something that is coming out recently you two need to get into therapy (her favorite out).” 

All the while she is saying this and my head is still in a “what?” state. I may be guilty of ignoring her messages because I don’t know how to respond without setting her off but I think it ultimately boils down to this

“I didn’t fore see becoming a grandma to go like this. I only get to see the kids once a month if that and you never invite us over, never initiate contact or invitations over. Is this how you want- to push everyone away? You were never like this when kid1 was born! (Dude I was in the fog so bad for the 2-3 years after kid1 was born) Just remember your grandparents are getting older, your siblings are getting older. We are getting older. Who else outside of your house do your kids interact with? Kid1 is in school and has school friends. What about kid2? Who do they interact with? We’re your family and live close by. And we’ll be moving soon. Is this how you want it to be? What about his parents? Do they call them? Do they video chat with the kids? Do they even know them?” 

I can’t articulate how lost this makes me feel. She is pulling a victim card and still believes my other half has sway over my thoughts and actions. But trying to get across how anxious  and draining the extended family is, is hard. I would love to have my kids visit but the boundary stomps are hard- especially since Nana believes that she hasn’t done anything wrong and still attempts to have me speak up and tell her. She tells me I was never like this. How the hell was I supposed to be myself when I was told to back down and be their doormat? When I was told to let things go, be the bigger person with things that happened in their house?

I have never changed my open door policy with her. The phone works both ways. Granted the past few messages I haven’t answered and here is why- she wanted to meet up on a free day of mine for lunch. Innocuous enough, but knowing her it is a way to corner me in public and shame me into doing what she wants. This is why I don’t like going out. And it’s that difference that she doesn’t get - I’m not her, my other half and I don’t like going out and doing the dating scene as we are home bodies. She believes we are hurting the kids by not giving them access “for the memories”.  

But the kicker to all this- she hung up on me."
480,"So my husband and I are looking to get a kitten and MIL was kinda aware of it and knew of someone looking to sell 2 kittens together. She texted us about them and I thought one was cute. We didn’t get much info on them and decided we didn’t want to adopt two kittens, only one.

Today she emailed my husband saying:

“I probably should have asked you first yesterday in regards to the kittens...:)
But only sending this info onto you so you can have input first... the seller said they are willing to split the kittens up and your wife mentioned she liked the white kitten ... just letting you know if you think you guys would like it. I won’t mention it to her though if you dont”

Umm.. I am upset because I feel I was left out of the decision making. Any advice on how to handle this situation?"
481,"I'm sensitive.  I know this.  I cry easily and my feelings tend to get hurt even when people don't mean to.  My SO used to call me his ""delicate flower"" which was always said in a sweet but joking manner.  However, in this case, I don't think I'm being overly sensitive (although please feel free to be honest if you think I am). 

Backstory - My SO died last October.  It was unexpected (but anticipated) and hit us all really hard.  He was a Marine who came back from Afghanistan with severe PTSD and an opioid addiction, and despite the number of times he tried desperately to get sober, he had far too many demons and ultimately died of an IV Heroin (Fentanyl) overdose.  He was the love of my life.  He was sweet, and funny and truly a good man who I miss every minute of every day.

His Mom is WONDERFUL.  I love her.  She and I were friendly when he was alive, but have become incredibly close since he died.  I went to her 3 days after we buried him and asked if she would be on board with me if I started a nonprofit foundation in his name in order to open a harm reduction, detox and recovery center.  Ultimately my goal would be to expand that to include long term therapy, housing and job placement - basically addressing all aspects of addiction in order to provide the most tools for success in recovery.  She was completely on board with this, and as of today we are officially a recognized nonprofit in our state and our federal application is being processed. 

MIL (just cause that's easier) and I do a lot of things together.  We attend a lot of functions related to veterans and a lot related to addiction.  We go to the cemetery together.  We go shopping and get our nails done and other fun things.  We talk pretty much every day either on the phone, or in Facebook messenger.  We genuinely enjoy each other's company.  

Sounds great right?  Except...sometimes she makes these ""jokes"" about me that truly hurt my feelings and I don't know what to do about it.  At first I thought I was being overly sensitive, but the longer it goes on the worse it feels.  They are mostly little remarks like she ""puts up with me"" or she's ""stuck with me"".  These are often said in front of others, including members of the community that we are making contacts with because they will help further our cause.  She is great at giving me credit for the Foundation and all the work that has been done to create it (HOLY CRAP a lot goes into starting a nonprofit!!!), but these little remarks are starting to add up and hurt.  

Here is an example:  Our Foundation has a Facebook page that I run.  I am the only one who posts on it, and I generally post whatever I want.  Today I posted something that I am aware is very controversial and after it went up, and sent the following message to our Board of Directors (which MIL and I sit on with 3 other people): 

""I post a lot on our Foundation’s Facebook page, and based on individual conversations I’ve had with you guys, I am pretty confident that I’m not saying anything that the majority of us don’t agree with.  That being said - if there ever comes a time that I post something that anyone strongly disagrees with, please bring it up so that we can discuss it as a group.  We are all part of this, and just because I’m the loudest, doesn’t mean only my opinion counts.""

Her response was ""You are a big mouth, but I'm used to it"".  I replied with ""Gee thanks.  You always know how to make me feel good about myself."" hoping she would realize that what she said was mean but that clearly backfired as her response was "" I try"" with a laughing emoji. 

Not only are my feelings hurt, but I'm embarrassed.   I love her son.  I am the driving force behind his legacy.  I am the one who gives him a voice now that he is gone.  I work INSANELY hard at making sure he is not forgotten and that his death has meaning.   It feels awful when she makes these comments, and it hurts even more when she does it front of other people.  

I have to find a way to GENTLY tell her this.  She isn't a very warm and fuzzy person.  She thinks her jokes are funny and doesn't even comprehend that what she is saying is hurting me.  How do I approach this?  This relationship is important to me....and she honestly doesn't even realize she this is a problem."
482,"I wonder if I am the only one who has. She lives with us and we set up a camera to keep an eye on her when we're not home due to her Alzheimer's. We caught more than we bargained for. We caught her on camera just trashing me, talking mad trash, outright lying about me/us. She denied it, hubs showed her the proof. Needless to say, I now know the truth. I really despise her..."
483,"With the passing of the Canadian Thanksgiving,  our first Thanksgiving story came to my mind. 

Before I part of the family,  just BIL was married (ex-sister-in-law large family got together and after they got married MIL &amp; DH were invited,  DH never enjoyed it) in my family,  we females got together days before to coon together (so I knew how to bake, cook and make a real holiday dinner) . When I met DH, he had a male housemate.  A nice young man,  who was without family locally,  so we decided to have a ""orphan Thanksgiving dinner"", if you were a friend and didn't have any place to go, you're invited to our house for dinner.  

Now MIL didn't enjoy going to Ex-SIL family dinner,  so DH invited her.  I had my 2 youngest daughters, a couple of friends and our housemate had a couple of army buddies with no place to go.  

I made a 15lb Turkey, a ham. Homemade stuffing,  mash potatoes and gravy,  a veggie tray, homemade rolls, roasted root vegetables and brussel sprouts &amp; 4 or 6 pies. (Other than prep work,  I did all of the cooking myself)  

My father's family was wealthy once upon a time, my father insisted that my sister and I KNEW that proper way to set a table,  silverware and napkins.   I  had the table pre-set up (my mom's good silverware,  severing dishes,  all set waiting for me to finish setting the table.  My MIL came in &amp; tried to kick me out of my kitchen, started ordering my daughters to set the table (I didn't want it set vhf to early as we have cats) I had to get DH to get her out of my hair. 

MIL had a comment about everything I served. I thought my 17 year old daughter was going to kill MIL. 

I told DH, I really didn't want her to come the next year (he was pretty upset with her behavior too) the second year she invited herself.  It was worse."
484,"Recap: JNMIL demands we celebrate our wedding anniversary days before the holiday weekend, even though my husband was away on a business trip, because she didn't want us to steal her thunder on Thanksgiving.

Update: Thanksgiving turned out absolutely amazing with zero issues about our anniversary or even talking about it! At least, none that I could see. In fact, it went so beautifully that I imagine I will be getting a phone call this week from JNMIL to dictate how Christmas is going to go. 

Now I can almost hear you guys: ""NegBar, that's great and all, but that can't be it? She's crazy. You're saying there was zero drama?""

There might have been, if karma hadn't stepped in.

However, MIL helped herself to some chocolates that were hanging out in a relatives bag. Chocolates we were saving to enjoy the day a little better. Homemade fun chocolates, if you will. 

MIL does NOT partake in this now-legal activity and has very little idea that most of the family does.

So... JNMIL was high all Thanksgiving day. 

Best. Holiday. Ever. Aside from when she thought she was having a stroke and all the other relatives had to calm her down. Only after a bunch of questioning did we realize what had happened. 

Suffice to say, I was completely off the shit list as a result and had a great time. Especially when JNMIL could no longer keep it together enough to finish cooking, so me and my aunty stepped in to finish it up. 

And now we have further proof that JNMIL DOES snoop through unattended purses and bags when no one is looking. She tried to be mad, but everyone instead scolded her that she shouldn't be in people's bags, and should definitely not be eating unknown things! 

That was not how I thought it would go, but I can't say I am at all disappointed. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a while. 

Tempted to make SAFE chocolates for Christmas and see if she will even try them 🤣

Karma, bitch!"
485,"My current boyfriend &amp; I have been together off &amp; on for what will be 4 years June of 2020. His mom has not liked me since about the first month of us being together, as I saw a text on his phone pop up from her with my name in it (later I looked at what she said) That something was “very off” about me &amp; that he should just cut his losses with me now before it gets drug out any longer, because “none” of his family cared for me expect his 8 year old sister. &amp; he just didn’t reply.
Fast forward through the years &amp; he’s had talks with his mom about giving me another chance &amp; whatnot. His mom &amp; stepdad invited me to things, events, holiday get togethers but I could tell his mom was never really that sincere about it or me being around. Kind of ignoring me if I spoke out or would try chiming into story telling with the family, etc. His stepdad always seemed like he really did like me despite what his mom said.
We even broke up for a few months in between this time &amp; he dated another girl for a brief time, but she said publicly like, “I’m SO happy you finally have a good girlfriend &amp; someone that is the best for you.” Like even though I’m trying to be the bigger person, thinking back on things like that really does hurt my feelings still &amp; always makes me wanna keep trying to get her to understand I care about her son just like she does &amp; not taking him for granted like she thinks, or “cheat” on him, or trying to take his money. I was with him even before he had a good job. It’s just really put a strain on things...
This summer was the worst of all. They were out of the country for vacation, &amp; he had friends over to their house because they have a big underground pool, so friends &amp; people were there having fun. Me &amp; my boyfriend kind of had a small argument during, so me being irritated didn’t come into the house when he “wanted to talk to me” because I didn’t want the arguing to ruin the time. It turned into a bigger argument than what it should have (his older sister showing up right in that worst time) &amp; telling me I needed to leave. 
So my boyfriend living in another town than I do, called my friend from around the area to come get me. 
His stepdad left me a message because I hadn’t had my phone to check until I was leaving that said, “ _ it’s _ get the f*** out of my house, leave __(my boyfriend)__ alone or you’ll deal with me once I get back in town you f****** little c*** b****”, kid you not. I don’t think I’ve ever heard something so disrespectful said to me in my life. So I called his mom before I left the house &amp; my friend, my boyfriend &amp; a mutual friend of ours I had brought sat on the other side of the house while I put her on speakerphone. 
Basically she said “I’m wrong for my boyfriend, he’s spent way too much money on me, if I ever cared for him I’ll leave him alone &amp; cut all contact. That if she sees me around she’s going to run me off. She’s heard nothing but bad rumors about me from the people from the town I lived in (she’s from the same place which is how I knew of my boyfriend) &amp; no one likes me, because they’re still friends with all my boyfriends exes &amp; she’s never liked me. It was so hard for her to be nice while I was around, &amp; my boyfriend deserves so much better because she doesn’t care what the whole story is of him not being innocent either. &amp; to gtfo of her house before she calls the cops. GET. OUT.”
That was a lot to swallow as we all just listened &amp; I left. My boyfriend later saying that the way his family acted was out of line &amp; very immature. Which it was, &amp; I said if something like that were to ever happen again &amp; he can’t stick up for me, it’s not going to work out obviously. I haven’t seen or talked to them since &amp; that was about 4 months ago. He still continues to be with me but I’m sure there’s a lot of talking she’s still doing. I don’t get it, it’s like she’s in love with or can’t let go of her son (she’s got 3 daughters/1 step daughter) he’s the only boy.
Why are some mothers/people just this way? I honestly can say I have a ton of people that would have my back when I say I truly try to be the best, most kind &amp; understanding person I can be. I try not to judge or initiate arguments &amp; things of that nature, but she seems to think I’m the worse person ever, she said shes never despised someone as much as me. 
Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the long post, but thank you to all who take the time to read!"
486,"Since we moved away and had kids we haven't gone home or had my ILs over for the holidays. Usually they have had other ties to their area for Thanksgiving but not so much for Christmas. 

Now my holiday as kids was me and my siblings and my parents in the morning and family over in the afternoon.  I enjoyed this and want to recreate this. I won't be trekking thousands of miles on Christmas with my kids. If we were near the ILS we'd probably spend the evening with them, but we aren't. I don't want them there in the morning for presents as I see mil trying to make the whole experience her grandma experience and it seems odd to say sure come visit but you can't come over until 2pm so wait in your hotel all day.

Anyways my DH is an only child. My mil brings up the holidays every year since things changed (us moving, no longer going to their house for every holiday) and DH always says something like ""we just want it to be our family on Xmas"" which I think stung mil because she said something like she was family too.

Anyways the reason for this post is because they visited from out of town this past weekend and mil again asked DH who again said something like we were doing just us for the holidays. (Mil conveniently asked the like ten minutes I wasn't around). And again she said something like my kids were her family too, my DH thought as a means to make him feel bad. 

I don't mean to ice her out, it just isn't convenient AND I sincerely think she would make every moment a ""grandma moment"". And honestly if she had thought more about being actually loving and welcoming to me instead of faking it and being incredibly entitled when the babies started coming she wouldn't be in this situation. 

I guess I just feel bad because my DH is an only, and it seems cruel to make someone celebrate a holiday alone(ish, sans kid/grandkid). But then I think, well I deserve to enjoy the holidays as well with my kids and not suffering through jokes made at my expense or being pushed out of special moments so the grandparents get the experience they thought they'd get (literally words fil said to DH in a conversation once about us not seeing them as much as they liked).

Tidbits from mostly tame visit:

It was mils bday recently, she went on and on about having a cupcake with my son. So I bought cupcakes and brought them out after dinner. Mil kept saying my son baked them for her ( weird). They go to eat it, she's trying to get my son to some happy birthday to her, he's a toddler. She's filming, since everything is about pictures and likes. Son super uncooperative, eventually she gives up. But like I just think it's weird she wanted a video of my toddler singing her happy birthday when clearly all he wanted was to eat a cupcake. It wasn't bad, but annoying because it takes her a while to give up, past the normal ok he isn't into this.

Then mil asks DH if she can give son toys she brought. He says sure. She gets them, one is actually a toy ds would love. I'm like ""oh wow, how did you all know, ds will love this"" being genuinely sincere and complimentary. Fil ""he calls us"" sarcastic, mil quips in, ""yea he calls us didn't you know"". Ok so I compliment you all and your assholes and make fun of me about it? I just don't get them or how that was a funny response."
487,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeutic at this point in time.

TPP seems to have no idea that children are actual tiny human beings with feelings of their own. She also seems to have no idea that anyone she gave birth to can have thoughts different from her own. 

&amp;#x200B;

These were when I only had one child, but she was ""HERS"". She never referred to her as my daughter, or my anything. She was HER granddaughter. Her baby. Hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she let it be known that DD wasn't a PERSON to her, she was a toy. She sent me an email that essentially asked me to treat my child like a gallon of milk, to be set out on the porch. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Please let me be grandma. I won't speak ro you at all if you don't want me to. Let me swing her in your yard a few minutes and I will leave. I won't take pictures, I won't bother you. You can just send her out the door and I will help her on the swings. You say 2 min then ok. I'll put her on the porch and leave. Nothing said. If I mess up and talk then you don't have to do it again if you don't want. I will not speak to you. Please.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

*""I don't understand how you can throw me away like trash. I love you and I have begged for forgiveness. You was always my special girl. So smart and so petty and I was so proud watching you grow up. The sleepovers and dancing. Always so much fun. At least you can't take that from me. I can not see how anyone with a heart could do her mom this way. I have cherish my grandbaby. My hurt comes from the idea you would ever think i would hurt DD and you not wanting a mom but I still love you.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, in true TPP form she can't leave those emails to just themselves. Oh goodness, no. She had to write a post on the book of faces. It shocked even me, and I knew how she was. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""Familys don't set boundarys only people who are trying to do bad things and hide their bad ways from their familys is who set boundarys. I gave birth to 2 kids with the expectitations that those 2 kids will be my kids for life. I didn't give birth to 2 kids to be told what i could and could not do and I refuse to do so. I have rights as a parent and rights as a grand parent and I will be damned if one of my kids try and tell me what I can and cant do. They're gonna learn; I am the mom and what i say goes. They won't be talking about boundarys anymore anytime soon.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

And there you go folks. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's how TPP feels about my boundaries and how she feels my child is a toy.. or an object?  lol."
488,"I think I could use some advice, if anyone has any tips on how to approach an upcoming conversation with my family (SOs NOILs).
 

SO and I have been very low contact with my parents for the past 3-4 months after a pretty major conflict. A problem that could have been solved with communication and respect devolved due to my parents lack of open communication, unwillingness to acknowledge poor behaviour, and taking our LC as a spiteful snub instead of the self-protective action it has been. For context, SO and I have been together for 12+ years, so this is not new territory for us to tread. I guess the difference this time is that, while I’d love to get back to a place where we can all participate in family get-togethers and be civil, I really cannot just ‘go along to get along’ anymore. I think that major work needs to be done if there is any hope of moving forward with healthy, respectful relationships between the four of us.


I don’t hate my family. But it is a very mixed bag of dysfunction. 
My dad is the classic rug sweeper, enabler, with a big heart and no spine. One on one he can acknowledge my moms bad behaviour, but tends to be basically a jellyfish when she is present.
My mom is some combination of undiagnosed alcoholic/narcissist/BPD. 


Besides the major recent issue, we have a history of issues such as (but not limited to) the points noted below. It would be impossible to sum up all of the dysfunction without writing a novel that no one really has time to read.

 
-          Mom making underhanded comments to SO and then backpedaling when called out (“I didn’t mean it as an insult!”)
-          SO and I often feeling like we’re furniture – required to show up for family events, but not really treated as people who matter (very little actual depth in the overall relationships, no one listens to what we say a lot of the time if I am being honest as well as an imbalance of consideration for us vs. my siblings)
-          In this instance, as well as in past conflicts, the catalyst for my parents trying to organize a conversation was one of my siblings basically telling them “This is uncomfortable for me and my family, I want this resolved so we aren’t all so fractured.” It often feels like the reason to mend fences is to keep sibling happy, not because of concern for what we’re feeling/upset about.
 

They’ve requested that we all get together and talk, which SO and I agreed to do. Neither SO or I really have high hopes for this conversation, as my mom tends to take blame poorly and be combative. I just sort of want to give it one good, solid, HONEST, attempt so I know I did what I could.

 
I think I am feeling like there is SO MUCH ground to cover that it is almost daunting. I have a feeling that my parents feel that if we discuss the recent conflict and all apologize then we’ll all move on and return to normal. But I feel that normal needs to be really recalibrated to truly have healthy, positive relationships. And I do want that, but I am not positive that we’ll all be able to get there. I may be underestimating them, but I don’t think my parents are necessarily very introspective or evolved in terms of things like conflict resolution and healthy relationship dynamics. It’s sort of like they never really learned these skills.

 
I think it’s important to outline our intentions for this conversation (to ourselves), heading in to it, so we know what we need to come from it to even consider it a positive experience. But I am feeling overwhelmed with even trying to sort that out. 


I feel like over the years I have read so much good advice on here, that has helped me learn how to handle my family and have a back bone and healthy boundaries, so I guess I am hoping for a starting point.


Do we use this conversation to specifically address just the recent situation?
Do we delve in to the overall problems in the relationship?
Do we plan to outline boundaries/needs going forward?
Or do we simply plan to address that there is work to be done and leave that ball in their court?


It feels like there is no neat happy ending to one conversation alone. At best, if they really can hear us out and consider our perspective, I would hope for us all to build a new, strong foundation to move forward on."
489,"Known my DH for 16 yrs &amp; MIL is overbearing, manipulative &amp; tries to cover it up by being fake nice, always smiling-creepy. Anyhow, the witch list is long, copies everything I purchase for myself or home, gave us the wrong picture time for BIL's wedding-late 2 hrs but her plan backfired, threw my clothes away &amp; said rats destroyed them, snoops our home when she babysits, attempted to reorganize my kitchen when I was @ hospital due to birthing complications, just to name a few.
Anyways, I stop talking to my 2 younger sisters because it was a destructive dynamic. Pretty much have been bullied &amp; used as scapegoat for the family &amp; after my near death experience w/child birth I cleaned house. Important to mention that either sister offer to help while @ hospital &amp; of course MIL was eager to "" breast feed"" my newborn if she could. Reluctantly accepted. 
I found my sister's fb post: @ sister's house helping her out while she's recovering. Bs, it's more like she came over my house &amp; ate dinner my MIL made &amp; went home. My 10 yr old told me. 
The 2 became fb friend, wtf??? And what really annoys me is that she comments on all my sister's post &amp; always says how beautiful she is. My posts, I'm lucky if I get a like. I feel humiliated because my friends &amp; family can see that. I'm not insecure &amp; don't need her approval of how I feel about myself. I just hate that she's so freakin fake &amp; when I see her she doesn't stop complimenting me on ""everything."" It annoys me. In person she's super sweat to me &amp; on social media I get nothing. I unfriend my sisters because they had it coming for years now. I don't follow my MIL, obviously.
My question is, what should I tell her when she smothers me w/fake niceities? I really want to avoid seeing her until next year to be honest. I want my holidays to be peaceful. Please help. I really have tried my best for 16 years &amp; I'm emotionally spent w/MIL. Tia."
490,"My son, which would be my mil's step-grandson has his last football game on Saturday night. Unfortunately SO has a gig Saturday night and won't be home to watch our other 5 very young kiddos. Mil offered to watch the first part of the game and then cone to my house to trade so I could watch the last part. Anyone else feel this is kinda messed up? She's slowly been driving a wedge in between SO and I and has control/micromanagement issues with me. Am I overreacting?"
491,"Hello, 30F new to posting, but I've been lurking here and there. Came over via AITA, but then started to realize that my Mom was definitely a JustNo. Probably going to be long.

Growing up me and my siblings were subjected to sudden rages, emotional abuse, some physical abuse and total ignoring of boundaries. I was smart enough to cotton onto the emotional abuse part, and was able to shine up my spine to protect my younger siblings. We all went to college or moved out and JNMom seemed to become a normal mellow human being.

I had to move back home, my exFiance decided that he would rather be banging my friend and roommate then stay in a 7 year long relationship. It was pretty fine at first I was deemed the GC because I actually helped around the house.

Now I think my Mom is trying to use me as an emotional support spouse since my EDad has to travel for work. He's here one week and then gone the next week. She's starting up with the behaviors that have always bothered me.

Talking outloud while I'm reading, and when I don't respond she'll start saying how I'm ignoring her, nvm that she didn't bother to say my name or make sure that I was paying attention. Complain to my sister that she can't tease me like she use to be able to do with my sister and then take pictures of me without my knowledge to send to said sister. Tries to pry into my relationship with my new boyfriend. Tries to get me to explain depression and how it affects people, while having fun diagnosing my other siblings by doing computer research. She knows tons about Aspergers, but lord forbid she actually does her own research on depression and anxiety even though her children have gone to Doctor's and gotten diagnosed with varying degrees of both.

She keeps trying to touch me. I've always hated being touched by her. I'm a very cuddly person but something about how she touches feels wrong. It's definitely not sexual. She likes to tug on hair, stand too close, pats my knee or back and today she fist bumped me even though I was pulling my hand away from her.

It seems like it's mostly BEC, but I figure she's just gearing up for a big boundary stomp and I'm not looking forward to it. I just want to leave stuff about NPDisorder out and about and be like I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. It feels more stressful knowing that my JNmom has this and having to pick an choose my battles. I can't move out at this time exFiance seriously fucked over my financials and I'm probably not going to be caught up for another year at least. Though considering that I now have way more stress being in the house then I do at work, I may have to see if I can get my stuff together sooner and find a roommate (can't move in with my new bf just yet either).

I'm just feeling stressed, wanted to vent and ask for advice for dealing with these things. I'll probably end up posting more stories about my Mom. I suspect that actually telling them to other people who get it will help."
492,"So yesterday I took a New sleeping med and ended up blacking out at a store and getting arrested for public disturbance. My trial is next week. I was released on my own recognizance.

My mom wants to come down. But all I want to do is sleep. I’m depressed, but not suicidal. I feel like a failure and a loser, but I really just want to sleep until I can work friday (my boss knows).  I have two kids under 3. Im ashamed of what I’ve done and I just want to be alone, but she won’t take no for an answer? What do i do? I already work in a field where people check mug shots online daily and have gotten tons of questions. I just want to sleep."
493,"I will start this by letting you all know that I really do try to understand where my MIL is coming from (she loves her grand-kids).  I recognize that she is a good person with good qualities.  I also see that she is so obsessed with our kids, that she is and has always driven me bonkers.  And it is not just the kids, she also has ZERO clue about boundaries.

I will provide things that she does, and I really would love some feedback on how to best handle this.

My in-laws live about an hour away.  We have 3 kids, two of whom are my Step-Kids, so we only have them every other week, which typically means two weekends a month for quality time.  The work and school weeks are rushed, and while there is time spent, it is not much.  I am cooking while they play...  then we eat and it is time to start bedtime routines.

Over the years, MIL has gone through my closets, helped herself to bake and cook in my kitchen without asking, helps herself to my children's' rooms and reorganizes things, painted my bathroom while I was at work with some paint she found which was NOT the color I wanted (was waiting to shop and buy the color I wanted), taken things...small things, such as baking liners and stuff...like, she would be babysitting for us on a day a child was sick and we had to work, and I get home and she's ""found"" baking liners and needed them so she let me know she took a box...  I mean, it's baking liners, no big deal, but ASK!!  She used to invite herself over, but my husband finally told her ""mom, you cannot just invite yourself over"", and to that, she apparently had a breakdown (according to the email my husband's brother sent about it) and she would not even speak to us for 2 weeks.  Those are just the things she does that falls under the ""knows no boundaries"" area.

The kids...  Ohhhh man...  the kids!

It is never enough. We try to go visit them every 3rd weekend.  We like to have at least ONE weekend a month with my step-kids for our family time.  Which only leaves one other weekend that we have them in a typical month.

Beyond that, somehow, we end up seeing them more often for birthdays, Holidays and you name it that comes up.

Recently (and this is what finally made me want to reach out for advice), my family and I were buying a new home.  It was a new build, which means we had to sell our old home, and there was about 6 weeks in between where we had nowhere to live while waiting for our new house to be completed.  I looked into apartments, and all of those required at least a 3 month lease.  So, we ended up staying with my In-Laws for those 6 weeks (even though I did not want to).  So, for 6 weeks, my MIL saw our kids EVERY minute we did.  For 6 whole weeks, we were living with MIL.

We closed on our new home on October 1st.  The first weekend we were there, we asked my MIL to come over and help watch the kids so that we could paint.  With a new build, they just paint the entire interior one color, so we wanted to paint prior to moving our furniture in.  So, she saw the kids that weekend, Oct. 5th.

Last weekend, she did not see the kids, BUT, my husband was at their property loading our furniture in a huge UHaul, to finally bring to our home to offload.  Her property is pretty big, and they have a HUGE shed which is where we stored all of our stuff.

Long story short, we have been SO busy for the past two weekends, there has been no QT with our kids.  Not to mention just OUR family time for the past almost 2 months!

She calls last night to tell us she wants to pick up the kids this Friday and let them spend the night and take them to a Fall Festival this weekend.  Not only that...  it is my husband's birthday this Saturday,,,Ya know... the kids' dad!!!!!

Are you freaking kidding me lady???????

And no, this is far from the first time she has bugged the crap out of us.  It is ALWAYS something.  Even though we have explained to her that we like to have ONE weekend with my step-kids (of course our daughter is always with us...) and the other weekend we come visit or they come visit us.  And again, there always seems to be some reason we end up seeing them MORE than that, anyway!

I mean, can we have some damn family time without always hearing your nagging voice about wanting to be with our kids?

It is always something...  ""Oh, there's this coming up, can we get the kids?""  ""Oh, the bookstore is having a huge sale, can you all come to this event?""

It's like there is always an excuse to call and ask what we are doing this weekend?  Which also gets on my nerves.  It's not like regular chit-chat and asking for no reason.  It is always ""What are you doing this weekend?"", and if we don't actually have plans yet, she is trying to make plans for us!

My husband...  wonderful man, wonderful Father.  But his personality is NOT one to cause waves or ruffle feathers.  I certainly have said things to MIL, but they do not sink in.  I mean, she thinks she has to know when our kids are out of school.  She pulls out a damn calendar to ask ""When do you have the older two next?  When are they out of school?""

Beyond saying it is NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS, what the hell do we do?  I mean, I have put things nicely, and i have been pretty blunt.  Nothing changes.

As I mentioned previously, the one time my husband put his foot down (in a nice way) the lady almost fell apart.

&amp;#x200B;

As for her life...  her husband has several illnesses, and is not doing the best.  I try to keep these things in mind...

Two sons in their late 30's that still live in her home.  One seems to have some mental issues...  the other is just eccentric and his skills are in things that aren't local to where we live, so he rarely has work, but he helps a lot around the property.

She is kind to me, but honestly, the kindness lost out a long time ago because all of her other antics drive me insane.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

**I JUST received this email!  This is after telling her last night that we are not heading that way to the Fall Fest. because it is Hubby's Birthday...**

494,"Someone I know and care for romantically is experiencing this... I want to support him and give him resources that could empower him to make his own decisions.

He (28m) is being financially abused and controlled by his mom (early 60s) and says the only way he will ever be free of her is when she dies.  So I probed a bit further and got more details on the hold she has over him.

1. Joint bank account

2. No credit card that is specifically tied to just him. He doesn't use the one they have, but pays it off while mom treats it like free money.

3. She is not working, and when she is working they both work at the same place. So he's paying her bills.

4. She guilt trips him on anything he spends as she can see the bank acct activity.

5.  She buys tickets and things for activities to fill his days off, despite him saying no. Like including plane tickets, entertainment shows and events, festivals etc. 

6. She has the door code and shows up whenever she wants.

7. Constantly Texting and calling him with plans and telling him what to do

8.  I'm sure there's more but ESPECIALLY bad is that she is a cosigner on his house.

So he's unable to take her off his bank acct because she holds the threat of being a cosigner on his house. If he does so she will make sure he can't have a home. 

He can't afford to get a lawyer, and she would be able to see any expenses anyway.

He's not willing to give up the home and cut her out of his bank acct. This is what I see as his only way out?

Anyone with similar problems or advice please comment.  He needs resources or something.  He wants help but turns down any idea I have with very valid reasons...she has such control over everything. 

Thanks for any ideas on how he can get free of this abuse. Yikes."
495,"We've happily been NC for almost 3 years and this is something that regularly pops in my mind. I have no doubt that my MIL blames me for everything, and I'm ok with it. In fact I'm happy about it. I'm hoping that writing it out this way will help some of you guys see that the horrible MILs that blame you for not getting their way are giving you a reason to be proud of yourself and your SO. As far as I'm concerned, it's a good thing they blame you. It means you are the exact opposite of them and their disgusting behavior. Take pride in the fact that you are meeting them head on and putting them in their place. Stay strong and stay proud!

(Mobile, sorry for any formatting issues)

It's all my fault, isn't it? It's my fault that you couldn't get away with it anymore. It's my fault that your son stopped putting up with your shit. It's my fault that your son chose someone else over you. It's my fault that you will never have a relationship with your grandchildren.

You know what? It IS my fault, and I AM FUCKING PROUD OF THAT! I'm proud that I got your son to understand that just because you're his mother does not mean he owes you anything and he doesn't have to put up with your toxicity if he chooses not to. I'm proud that your son reached his limit with you and decided you aren't worth it anymore. I'm proud to be the person your son chose to stand by instead of you. I'm proud that your son and I will forever put our ACTUAL family over you and your bullshit. I am and always will be proud of the fact that I was the last nail in the coffin for you. There are plenty of people who showed your son love and support, but until I came along he still tolerated your bullshit. Now though, you will never have a relationship with our children. You will never be allowed to taint our home with your vile manipulative abuse. You'll never see the amazing father your son is going to be. You'll never see how amazing our relationships with our children will be. You will NEVER get the chance to mentally, emotionally or physically abuse our children like you did with your own. It kills me that your son didn't have the mother he deserved and still longs for. But you know what? He is so much better off without you. I know it, and he knows it. You will forever be alone, and that gives me so much satisfaction.

There are only 2 things I will ever give you positive credit for. 1) birthing your children. You were shit at raising them, but without you they literally wouldn't be on this planet. And 2) giving your son a shining example of the kind of parent he NEVER wants to be. He will do whatever he can to make sure he is NOTHING like you. For those things, I thank you. Solely because you were such a shit mother, your son will be the absolute BEST father to our children. I am so incredibly proud of the amazing man your son has become. How he managed to get where he is in life with such a manipulative and abusive person like you raising him is beyond me, but he deserves so much credit for getting there anyway. 

Our lives have been so peaceful without you. We are happy, we are strong and we are thriving. Nothing you did worked. You lost at every possible game. You couldn't keep your son under your thumb. You couldn't keep your friends from seeing through the curtains. You couldn't even manipulate your own family to turn against me. Most importantly of all. You didn't break me. You didn't break US. We are stronger than ever and there is not a damn thing you can do about it.

I am proud, and that will never change.


Edit: Thank you for the silvers! I hope people can find a reason to feel pride in themselves. Every little action you take to protect yourself or your family (mentally, emotionally or physically) is a reason to feel proud. Even if you can't feel proud of yourself, I am so incredibly proud of you!! &lt;3"
496,"So, it's my mom and my relationship has been super rocky with her since I was a teenager.  I was NC with her through my pregnancy in 2014 and god knows she throws that at me every time I turn around.  After she remarried, my brother and SIL won't visit her unless my DH and I are there as well.  I'm super bubbly/energetic and usually deflect any crap my mom tries with any of us.  Well, two years ago my family moved out of state, leaving my brother and SIL behind with my mom.  After 9 months we moved back since it wasn't working out where we went.  When we came back my mom let us stay with her, saying it was her way of paying us back the thousands of freaking dollars she owes me.  After a month she started to demand more money from us and my step dad started being verbally abusive towards me when no one else was around.  It led to things exploding in an epic fashion with my then 4yo sobbing begging to never go back there because she hates it there.  We went NC with her and life has been soooooooo much better.  The thing that made me feel slightly guilty is I was talking to my SIL who's pregnant and she expressed concerns about my mom.  She doesn't want her kid to go through what my daughter did.  I found out they haven't seen my mom in 2 years, despite living close though they do still talk to her through texts, and now that I've gone NC they're getting the whole brunt of my mom's crazy.  I told her that if the two of them decide to be in her life keep it to meeting for lunch or something because it's not worth it for anyone involved.  I've always been so much better at standing up to my mom than my brother and I want to protect them but at the same point life is so peaceful without that.  I'm not sure if it makes me terrible to want them to go NC as well."
497,"Happy Fall everyone! We’re in the South so we *just* got below the 80F mark and we are LOVING IT. While it’s been a minute since I’ve posted anything about my short, squat nightmare of a MIL (now simply referred to as BIGGERMIL because I’m petty), it hasn’t been from lack of instigation on her part. We, D(ear)H and I, have been working on our lives +1,000 miles away and have been growing more and more distant from the ILs. It’s been pure bliss. For all the idiots that claim “You can’t buy happiness”- they aren’t thinking big enough. For the combined fee of 1 UHaul trailer and several tanks of gas, we have our happiness.
 
In the interim, we have had a series of deaths and births in the family that justify our return to TX and an extended weekend trip, at the start of a weeklong state tour, to the ILs. That went very, very poorly and resulted in me staying with a friend after day 2 and DH staying for a total of 5 days (remember we only meant to say 3 days at their house before visiting other relatives and friends). We didn’t fight, I didn’t make a stand. Day 2, DH simply told me that the next morning I should leave and stay with a friend. His words were “You’re my wife and it’s my job to keep you safe. This is not the kind of environment that I should subject you to and I’m sorry.” What happened you ask? Toxicity and FOG. Let me bullet point:

·         BIGGERMIL lost it because her BBBAABBBYYY (BIL2) was graduating HS and now had a valid reason to leave that hoarders nightmare. BIL1 came as well, but was distant because he has already left and lives states away as well. BIL1’s GF didn’t even bother with an excuse. She just didn’t arrive with BIL1. It’s almost like NO ONE LIKES MILS BRAND OF CRAZY TOWN. 

·         The “environment” mentioned was a daylight basement with a king bed in the corner for DH/me and a couch in front for BIL/SIL. No walls, no doors. Just a good ol’ family sleep over. A bunch of adults co-sleeping in the same room. In BIGGERMILs words “She’s (OP) too spoiled to sleep in a room with other people?”.

·         ILs live 35 minutes from anything that will sell you something to eat and the fact that she did not make any actual meals for the 2 days I was there- resulted in the first time I’ve ever hit my goal weight and lost weight on vacation. She was starving everyone out.

·         BIGGERMIL threw a party while we were there, but did not tell us the correct start time (for everyone coming over to her house for HER PARTY). This resulted in me finishing my shower, wrapped in a towel (only one bathroom for the house so you have to minimize time spent with the door shut) and creeping down the hall to the basement when the front door is opened and ALL OF DHs cousins piling in to see me wet/naked/covered in only a very small towel and MORTIFIED. 

·         BIGGERMIL did not have any food for the party. Apparently she put this on all of the relatives to bring food for everyone at the party.

·         BIGGERMIL threw a fit because we “locked” the basement and did not allow any of the party guest into our “room”. She wanted to show everyone a tour of her house. Important side note: ILs have a lot of friends who are/were drug addicts. Never mind that several of my things have walked away every time she’s helped us move, we did not want to tempt the rest of her ilk.

·         BIGGERMIL took the entire week off work so she could spend time with fffaaammmiiilllyyyy but essentially spent it blocking everyone’s cars in the driveway (so we couldn’t leave) and watching trash TV.

·         Best part: BIGGERMIL kept cornering me about how BIL2 was only getting into trouble (weed in high school) since DH left the state, implying that he’s headed down the wrong path and it’s DH’s fault (she’s the actual parent in case anyone is keeping tabs). She also kept corning DH about FIL’s drinking (full blown alcoholic and verbally abusive when it gets bad) and how he should “talk to his dad about it” WHILE pouring FIL double shots of tequila every other hour.

Several other things happened, but you get the picture. I essentially scarified DH to BIGGERMIL so he could hit is own rock bottom. It took 3 additional days after I left for him to call me panicked because he “just couldn’t take this anymore”. We ended up begging favors, missing out on several family visits and crashing on several friend’s couches because DH felt guilty for shutting his mother down by *LEAVING WHEN WE ORIGINALLY INTENDED* even though he in fact stayed two additional days. It was mortifying to explain to our friends who put me up super last minute but luckily everyone met BIGGERMIL during the wedding shenanigans to understand my desperation.
 
Our last stop of the trip was my godparents. They are the best people on both sides of the family and honestly, they aren’t actually blood relatives. My godfather hears the whole story and took DH aside to comment “Some people you can visit and stay over, and some you don’t and shouldn’t spend the night at. Get a hotel next time.”
 
Bless him.
 
One last thing- a few weeks after the Texas trip, BIGGERMIL called DH and was rambling as usual. She slid in the fact that “(OP) was so rude and she was sooooo hurt that DH left early and *cut her vacation short*.”"
498,"fffffffffff. 

last year she was with us; it was LO’s first Xmas and she gave him, and us, her stinking rotten cold. happy first Xmas, kiddo, ho ho achoo. 

it was BIL’s turn to have her this year. we’re in the UK, he lives in the US. she’s suddenly decided she’ll go to them for next /Easter/ instead. 

“The Americans just don’t know how to DOOOO Christmas. It’s just not Christmassyyyyy. They don’t even do Christmas puuuuuuudding.” 

this is just her way of shitting on SIL’s amazing, but American, cooking. MIL bangs on about “putting dessert on the same plate as yer roast!1!” - she’s talking about sweet potato mash, le horreur. one year she even bought her own fucking turkey over there and took up SIL’s kitchen space to COOK IT ALONGSIDE SIL’S XMAS DINNER. BIL, like us, is vegetarian. 

so, OH has booked her flights (despite learned helplessness and a tech allergy, she still tried to backseat-book and tell him how to do it). she refuses point blank to layover, so her timing options are limited. that’s the airline’s fault, obviously. she refuses to go for more than five days, and it’s the most expensive time of the year. in previous USA years, she has insisted on being back for OH’s new-year birthday, when her very presence bums him out. regardless of which holiday, though, he will have to take time off work, take her to the airport on the day and literally hold her hand all the way to the check-in desk. she’s barely 60. 

this is all so she can play Easter Bunny over the three niblings and bitch about it not being a PROPER Easter lunch without a roast (again, vegetarians all round).

we had been looking forward to a winterval of peace, and goodwill to all not-MIL. now we’re going to have to put up with her emotional vampirism all through the season. she’ll attempt to crash Xmas Eve. she’ll want to take kiddo to see ‘Santa’ (father fucking christmas in this house, thank you). she’ll buy a wildly inappropriate amount of entirely unwanted gifts, then complain that we have too much stuff and that she’s running out of money. she’ll compliment whatever veggie food we make to our faces, then do the phone rounds of the few people who still put up with her nonsense to whine about never having a Traditional Christmaaaaaaas. 

thankfully we give zero fucks about her feelings and won’t be accommodating any of them. but we do feel for OH. there’s a level of relaxation he achieves when she’s on another continent that’s impossible for either of us to get to when she’s only seven mins down the road or harassing him for honeydo jobs over the phone. 

the only way to dilute her during hols is to have our own side of the fam come too; but that turns dinner for 3.5 into dinner for 8.5. we CAN do it, but we don’t bloody WANT to. 

we’re also not going to expose an already-beleaguered waitstaff to her black hole of doom on Xmas day of all days. she’s bad, eating out. OH tells one childhood story of his fam sitting down at TEN different eateries one time because every place had ‘something wrong’ with it. she treats servers like idiots and poisoners, and gets louder with each drink. she hates tipping and we have to add to it every fuckin’ time. we’re not prepared to ruin the entire restaurant’s holiday as well as our own. 

sooooo. ffffffffff. long breath, another cuppa, and elaborately creative and imaginative ways to fill the hole we’re currently digging in the back garden. we’re planning a patio, MIL, honest. should be finished by, oh, New Year sometime..."
499,"Long time lurker, first time poster! Be gentle with me haha.

For a little background, things haven't always been kosher between my FMIL and me... Like, not at all. She's had her claws sunk deep into her children for many years (and has been a real Jocasta let me tell ya), but recently she's taken great steps to improve her relationship with her husband and SO (who is also coming out of the FOG). As a result, our relationship has strengthened a lot and we've found ways to compromise as we live really close and family is very important to both SO and me.

HOWEVER. I receive a lot of unwanted, unsolicited advice from her about my relationship with SO and it is ***so damn irritating***. FMIL always sticks her nose in my business and thinks she sniffs out a relationship crisis that she needs to rescue me from. 

It's demeaning, because I'm not a damsel in distress who needs to be rescued. I will and do talk to SO when I need to and we always face our problems together. It's frustrating as hell, because I feel like she just wants super personal details about our relationship. *And worst of all*, I word vomit around her when she asks, so it makes me anxious! I'm always afraid I'll reveal something to her I shouldn't.

Okay. Back story over, onto today's problem. I received this lovely text this morning. http://imgur.com/a/CYpBbrH

Just in case that link doesn't work, here's the transcript of the text: 

""So. [OP]. I know you like getting advice as much as you like, well, getting unsolicited advice, but ima do this anyway. Virginia Woolf was right and a woman needs a room of her own. Even though I'm up to my saggy boobs in [SO] flotsam and jetsam, I'm squirreled away in his room, making a quilt and happy as a pig in shit. I don't have to worry about visitors seeing the mess and I don't have to worry about putting it away in between ""shifts."" Did you notice how [Relative] asked, ""so is this [OP's] desk?"" I think she picked up on the fact that there isn't much [OP] room. You and [SO] do a GREAT job of working together and creating your beautiful space together. Make sure you leave a beautiful space for [OP] and her creativity. That's all for today. As you were. ❤️❤️❤️""

SO and I just recently bought a home together, and we love it. I mean, just fucking adore it. It's our's and we're decorating it together, and in ***no way*** do I feel like I have no space of my own. Once again, she's sticking her nose in where it doesn't belong and trying to save me from a made up problem.

I really do appreciate that she's thinking of me and prefer this over our issues in the past, but how can I deal with her inserting herself into our lives in the future?"
500,"FMIL actually hates me, and has not even really talked to me. We have met once and she ignored me essentially the entire time. She says I’m ‘lower class’ because I have tattoos. She thinks I’m also a drug addict, promiscuous, and a cheater. She likes to tell my SO (20) that I’m only with him for his money (he’s a broke college student), that I’m going to trap him by getting pregnant (I’m on birth control), and more very crude terms. My SO stands up for me, but she holds financial dependence over his head. She threatens to take away his car and stop paying for his college, even though she doesn’t work, and it’s his father’s money. I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I confront her and stand up for myself? This is putting such a strain on the relationship and I’m tired of her slandering my name when she does not really know me.

EDIT: We are somewhat long distance, 2 hours between us because we go to different unis. His mother tries to prevent us seeing each other by threatening to take everything away."
501,"Update for everyone! Sorry about the formatting - on mobile. 

So some additional back story, we moved to the small town we live in now a few years ago to be closer to his parents at the time (it’s where they have lived for years). Our relationship didn’t start deteriorating until this year but those “jokes”  about my acne/weight/everything about me had happened for years. I excused the behaviour because of their age (70’s) but really they’re just not very nice.

Yesterday sucked. I said, “how bizarre that a man in his 70s feels the needs to make fun of his daughter in law in her late 30s. You really need a hobby guys.” And left. They didn’t have much to say. 

Now for some good news! We had been debating moving since the pre-wedding debacle, but held off hoping they’d try and reconcile or apologize. Hah. If anything they’ve doubled down. 

So we’re moving. 2500 miles away. I’ve had multiple job offers and interviews lined up but we’ve been dragging our feet. It’s time. We felt bad about leaving them because we really wanted to be there for them in their elderly years, but honestly, my mental health is way more important. My husband is heading over there now to tell them in person. I’ll get blamed - I don’t care. They have put a major strain on our life and the five months we’ve been married have been tough because of their interference and negativity. Actually four years of negativity but most of it masked in “jokes.” Time to start fresh. 

Thank you all for your comments and messages. I read all of them! I really appreciated it all. 

tl;dr - told them off, left, moving 2500 miles away next month. Selling all of our stuff and going. Good riddance to those who drag us down. Love y’all."
502,"First post, so if I use incorrect terminology or wording, sorry! 
Advice appreciated!

Background info: JNMom is emotionally and physically abusive, literally shattered my family (might post later, still not ready), and constant manipulation.

So I am currently at 1 year NC (no contact) with my JNMom, and I somehow received a message from her on an old social media platform that I had forgotten about. As I have blocked her on every foreseeable platform. It has just brought everything back up to the surface.
JNMom has a long history of emotional and physical abuse, both of which were always played off as either me not understanding a joke or me doing something to deserve it. 

Recently JNMom wrote my older sister a letter. Older sister has been NC for 4-5 years now. The  letter has the normal routine of martyr, and how everyone is against her. Somehow I managed to not get mentioned in the letter, thought I was somehow off free. 

Then I received the message. “I love you”. No guilt trip, no cruel words, just that. And I gotta say it really kinda broke me. 
I’ve always lived by a simple motto when it comes to my mother, beware of something nasty pretending to be something nice. I understand that if I respond I’ll be opening up a can of worms that took a lot to close in the first place. 

I guess I just want to know, how do you guys handle NC?"
503,"Am I over reacting? MitM has not visited our LO since she was in the hospital. She has only met LO the one time which was about two months ago. She sends texts to DH “it’d be nice to see the baby”  or “it’d be amazing if you all came over so we can see the baby” etc. But honestly it works both ways? It’s MUCH easier for people to come visit LO than to pack up everything we may need and bring her out in this heat. We live 20 minutes away so it’s not like it’s a far commute. Everyone else who wants to see LO always comes to see us. I just feel like that’s proper etiquette? I honestly feel like telling us how nice it would be if we came over isn’t putting out much effort to see LO? That’s putting it all the initiative on us. And after her antics (throwing a fit about our new baby rules, refusing to acknowledge I birthed LO, not congratulating us etc) i feel like an apology is needed, and I don’t feel the need to make an effort. It also irritates me to no end that she only calls LO “the baby”. Like she has a name!! Use it!! What if i just started calling you “the old hag”. Would you like that??"
504,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dho2qf/mil\_sneaking\_in\_our\_house\_and\_is\_now\_trying\_to/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dho2qf/mil_sneaking_in_our_house_and_is_now_trying_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

So quite a lot happened since yesterday. I stopped answering most comments, as I was just taking in everyones advice, thoughts and own experiences.

First some info again:

\- Some people were concerned dropping off the door would mean she could copy the keys. Not possible as both the door and locks were replaced with high security keys ( I know a locksmith could still duplicate them, but that would take some time )

\- Some were worried about birth control. Don‘t worry, I can‘t even think of sex right now.

\- Concerning security, no I did not catch MIL on camera, I installed them in conjunction with the change of the door and locks and I don‘t see a point in spending money on more cameras, ring doorbells etc.

\- Some asked if MIL had more children. Nope. Single child.

\- I paid the entire 450K, my wife didn‘t pay for the house, renovations, nothing. She bounces from one job to another, trying to find something fitting. This has always been the case, I don‘t mind supporting her but I feel a bit leeched off sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the actual update:

I called FIL and asked him if he would meet me for a coffee and that I wanted to talk, bless him, he did exactly that. We sat down, I asked him to please just listen and not interrupt. I must have talked for close to 2 hours, this man sipped his coffee, listened, sighed and said the following in short:

\- MILs plan was it to sell us the house, rebuy it, making us literally homeless, so we couldn‘t say no to her offer so we would live with her and FIL.

\- FIL did try to hold MIL back but failed. He was extremely upset about the police call, upset about only offering 430K back and upset in general that she‘s going this far, to shackle her daughter.

\- His offer and advice: Take MILs 430K offer, I will set up a legally binding contract under FIL and myself, he will give me the 20K + what I put in renovations etc without MIL knowing - that would bring me close to 500K.

\- He told me to pack it up and just leave after a stern talk with wife, she won‘t wake up if It‘s me vs MIL as long as one of us is in close proximity - he looked sad and upset. We hugged at the end and he told me to not be too saddened by all of this and sometimes we need to make hard decisions and I would regret if I didn‘t do this.

There was more talk obviously but this is the short and interesting part.

Back home, I talked with my wife, calm tone and manner -  she didn‘t see no evil from her mother, said her mother needs a lot of attention and love like most elderly ladies and often times she sounds meaner than she actually is but that she only wants the best for us ( us? No, what‘s best for her and only her own intentions )

We argued a bit back and forth and my wife is 100% behind her mother and said I should get some therapy to get out of the obsession I have with demonizing her mother. I stood up and left. Slept at a friends that night.

I offered couples and individual counseling. It was denied. Apparently Im the only one that needs “special attention“ as she called it.

And I guess that‘s exactly what I need. Special attention. By myself, for myself.

I already messaged FIL.

It‘s not worth it. Thank you everyone. Thank you for taking the time and helping out and listening to someone you don‘t know.

&amp;#x200B;

I might take this homeless opportunity and money to get out a bit, explore and breathe freely for once."
505,"Long time lurker, first time posting. 

Apologies for any typos or formatting issues. (On mobile)

Cast: ME (29) DH (30) JNMIL (71)

Background: DH &amp;amp; I have been together on and off for about 6 years. We split once and got back together 3 years ago. We fully committed this time  and got married just last week. We are currently expecting our first child together and I have a child from a previous relationship. (This is key info later related to JNMIL. 

DH and his mother have always had a close relationship from what I can tell, at least since I’ve been in the picture.Though he had mentioned that she used to physically and verbally abuse him as a child, it seemed as though they had put this all behind them. It was hard to believe that she was capable of that when we I first met her as she seems so sweet snd soft spoken. As the years went on I began to see her true colors. This intensified once DH (BF at the time) had to move in with his parents to avoid a bad living situation. 

One thing I had always known was that JN is a hoarder. She has never had to pay rent at the house that they’re in because DHs great great grandfather built it and it has been passed down on his dads side of the family since. So she essentially uses all her money to go shopping and buys so much stuff that the house, which should have ample space, is hard to walk in. The house has plenty of room for not only one family but two, its just filled with clutter. Upon moving in I told DH that the cluttered environment made me very uncomfortable and anxious. Growing up my mom was very strict about keeping the house immaculate. Living there and dealing with them mess sub sequentially caused me to start therapy. 

While living there, DH &amp;amp; I made it a point to keep our areas clean and always tidied up after ourselves. This was especially true in the common areas (we all shared a bathroom and the kitchen). We would even go as far as cleaning up after his parents to ease their burden a bit. 

The kitchen was so cluttered and filled with her abundance of stuff that we could not sit down to eat or easily prepare a meal. To put it in perspective, she had 13 cutting boards, all essentially the same size and dimensions. Nothing special about them, there were just duplicates of everything for no reason. The living room was also unusable due to the mountains of clothes she kept on the couch. This made it impossible for me to watch games or the news with my FIL, which I absolutely adore! We would have to watch tv in the kitchen standing up. 

As if this weren’t bad in itself, the thing that really made me angry with her to the point of resentment was how she treated my 9 year old son. My son has always been very chatty and energetic, something she hasn’t had to deal with since DH was a child quite a while ago. There were numerous times where I would hear how she would talk to my son when she thought I couldn’t hear her. She would then turn all sweet as soon as she saw me. Once I seen this facade and how she was rude to my son when she thought no one was present, I stopped asking her to help watch him. I told DH about my concerns and he told me I was right to feel that way. He has always had my back when it comes to my mom, but he knows that we had to treat it delicately because we were in their house. 

So fast forward to the present, we finally moved out a few months ago after a year of being there. We bought a condo about 20 miles away, which in traffic it can take an hour to get to from the city we were in. Thank goodness its not easier for JN to get here quicker. It feels so good to be out of there. 

As I mentioned, I am expecting my first child with DH. I sent her an update of the sonogram and she said “aw, look at OUR little baby. Thats what rubbed me the wrong way and prompted me to write this. That made me so uncomfortable because A) she did not help me make this baby, cuz ew gross.  B) she is not suffering the effects of this hyperemesis gravidarum that I am going through. So she can not claim this is HER baby. Maybe I am over reacting because I am cranky and hungry because I can’t keep squat down despite the medication my Dr put me on. Either way, I want to say something but I just don’t know what.

UPDATE: I waited all day for DH to call his mother and address this. It’s his last day of his vacation that we took for our honeymoon so he told me he would put it off until tomorrow.  

I decided to text her tonight instead. I wrote: “Could you do me a favor and not call the baby ""ours"". It makes me uncomfortable. I am not trying to be rude, it's just that Im carrying the baby and having to deal with the immense nausea. Im glad you're excited about your grandbaby though. “

Maybe I was being too polite, idk."
506,"I feel like I should have seen this coming. Sorry if this is unclear or pieced together strange, I’m still processing.

Recently FH and I got engaged! Everything was well with Mom for a while but it wasn’t long before things changed. Some background on Mom, she’s always been petty when she doesn’t get her way. I had difficulties with her growing up and I’ve recently realized there was an element of emotional and psychological abuse there (towards me). She had a difficult upbringing and I’m confident it comes from there. She’s very emotionally stunted.

Eventually, I get told by Sister who is a brides maid that Mom is upset that I’m not going to her first on wedding things. So I try to include Mom a bit more. Suddenly she’s mad that I’m not inviting who she wants at the wedding. My wedding that hasn’t even been paid for yet (and that FH and I are covering most is the costs for) and that is a year away. FH and I wanted something small so we can keep costs down (because weddings are expensive y’all!) and i just can’t invite her extended family that I barely know just because. 

So I try to explain the cost and how uninvolved in my life her extended family have been, but it doesn’t resolve anything. Mom has a tendency of giving the silent treatment when she’s not getting her way and that’s what she resorts to. I confront Dad and he tells me she’s very upset due to her losing her own mom earlier this year, and how she thinks I’m shutting her family out (well you can’t shut out people who don’t try to be there). I again go to her and try to explain the choice is not personal against her but she gets all ‘Do what you’d like, I’m not going to cause friction’ and essentially all ‘woe is me, my daughter doesn’t care about me’. Very passive aggressive. I try to talk it out like adults and she just continues with it. Won’t even try. I finally tell her that I’m an adult and need her to act like one if it’s going to be resolved. I ended up telling her she needs to seek counseling so she could process her emotions and not act immature towards me, and that we could communicate again when she’s figured things out. I didn’t block her but she hasn’t responded, though I know she’s seen it. 

I avoided resorting to being petty back, although I was probably very blunt. Her behavior has been influencing me and I haven’t been sleeping well and I was hoping we could talk it out but apparently not. I feel like I made the right decision, but I feel bad about it. I guess I need confirmation I made the right call and didn’t just blow up at her. 

TLDR; My mom is still grieving about her loss and is taking it out on me in a way that’s affecting my health. She won’t be rational and discuss it like adults so I told her to seek counseling."
507,"We went to visit my FIL yesterday. He and my son both had a birthday on August 27th. My FIL has been in poor health, so we have been trying to go visit and MIL has shot us down each time we have tried. Now, she didn't make any effort to bring our son his birthday gift either. She has ALWAYS played favorites, and will bend over backwards for my other son, but for this one, she just treats him like crap. 

So yesterday we were finally allowed to see him. We had gotten him a nice San Antonio Spurs blanket. He doesn't get out any more, and he goes from the bed to his chair, to watch TV. He has mentioned being cold. I figured it was a nice gift. Plus, I refuse to buy him anything with the Dallas Cowboys on it. I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan. Last year I bought him a Cowboys lamp, and their losing streak ended and they won the division and went to the playoffs. Yes, I am superstitious like that! MIL made a comment about how we should have gotten him a hat instead. I let it go. He has something like 20 hats anyway.

So she handed my son his card. Then she handed my husband a card and said, ""Happy Anniversary!"" Well, I had honestly forgotten (because I really don't celebrate an anniversary with him any more. It's a marriage of convenience at this point because of many reasons, one of which being his refusal to stand up to his mother for the way she has treated me and my youngest son, and how she has turned our oldest son against me. Our actual anniversary was July 19th and she told him at the time that she was giving us cash. Now, she has seen us a few times since then, but had conveniently forgotten to give us the cash. So when she gave him the card last night, I thought it was great, because we REALLY needed the cash right now. I am about to have surgery on Monday and we are hemorrhaging money right now to pay for it and stuff related to it. 

Now, she knows about my surgery. I have been getting sick every time I eat for 5 years now, and getting my stomach finally fixed is a really big deal. I am now able to eat now, as we are making sure my entire system is completely cleaned out, and I won't be able to eat until at LEAST late November. Even then it will be soft protein light scrambled eggs and cottage cheese. He opened the card and it was a gift card to a Mexican food restaurant. It was so horribly cruel. She KNOWS I can't eat. She has known this was coming for months. So he is all happy because it is his favorite restaurant, but I am just miserable because I can't enjoy it. I was the biggest F\*\*\* you to me. Honestly I want to drop kick her into next week, but he isn't going to do anything to stand up to her.  I am really thinking it's time to get the Hell away from her and him. I do love FIL, but unfortunately he is just as much of a prisoner at this point as I am."
508,"Excuse the typos, I just smoked so much weed. 

I just want to start by saying I live in a country where it's super common to add your children as owners of the house as soon as they are born. 

My Fmil is being weird over my Fdh adding me to the ownership of his house. To be honest I get it, when I met Fdh I was an unemployed single mum in school. She can be very JY and very JN depending on how the wind blows. She wasn't always like this, at the very beginning when I first met her she was amazing until she was diagnosed with kidney failure. That's when she started to rage and flip between happy and angry. 

An example of her being a mixed JN/JY was when I wanted to do a masters degree and she knew my SO couldn't afford to support the 3 of us (me DD &amp; Fso) on his income for the whole time. She got angry/high and told him I was using him to support myself and my child. Then the next day she brought over a bag of money (literal duffel bag stuffed with money) and told me not to worry about bills during my degree and that she was sorry. She later admitted she took a bunch of pills because of the cramps from dialysis and that's why she said what she said. 

The latest issue is in regards to the home Fdh owned before he met me that we live in currently. She doesn't want him to add me to the deed and even wants him to sell it before we get married. 

She's threatened to disinherit him over this. But at the same time she's made my DD the sole recipient of her life insurance and added DD to the deed of her home with her other 2 grandchildren. Just maybe MIL told Fdh to only put DD on the deed of his house and not me. I don't really understand her sometimes, she's not outright malicious but sometimes her actions sting, even small things like preferring my DD to me. If I give her credit for one thing it's that she treats her children and grandchildren equally, no favorites, No SG, No GC. 

I can see where she's coming from regarding keeping his house from before marriage for himself but I don't get why my DD being an owner and not myself would make such a difference. It's not so much a control thing for her, she's been open that she wants Fdh to never have to worry about loosing the money he worked hard to make, she's admitted to marrying and divorcing to scam money from men to support her children. The woman has 0 ethics and she's proud of it. She thrived in the corruption during the 90s in Ukraine and used that as a springboard to a life for her kids in America. I wonder if she's worried because she sees herself in me. I also have trouble understanding her behaviors with her going from mean to nice and back again so quickly but that's medically explained by her needing dialysis. Her kidneys don't filter like a normal persons and she tends to get angrier if it's a weekend when she has to go from Friday to Monday without dialysis. 

At the end of the day part of me wonders if this is her way to officially make my DD a grandchild and be equal and fair to them without looking ""soft"" to the outside. She can't stand when people see her as a nice older woman. Someone told a joke about her baking cookies and making lemonade with grandkids in her retirement, her response was that she used to break people legs for a living (this was before the kidney failure). She just has an aversion to being seen as a nice kind person due to her position in her past life but at the same time I see how she enjoys spending time with my DD and her other grandkids, she even enjoys giving to charity but God forbid if anyone found out. I  think she would melt into the ground if someone saw her as nice or kind.
  I can't make up my mind, just when I decide she's a JY she does this."
509,"To give you background: when I was pregnant my now fiancé, then boyfriend, opted to keep living with his parents (until I was 6 1/2 months pregnant) and the following ensued...

My JNMIL was under the impression that my child was going to live in her house WITHOUT ME. She made it very clear that she doesn’t approve of couple living together prior to marriage but talked all about how she “needed to get a crib and a dresser and bath stuff” for my baby. I made it clear to my ( then )boyfriend  that my child would live with me and only me, I would be breastfeeding and if he chose not to move in he would simply get visitation when he had time (which of course I hated saying but..) Fast forward a month and we all end up at target and JNMIL pressures boyfriend into buying a portable crib for her house and said he should buy a second for mine, despite me saying more than once that my parents were gifting me with an entire nursery set. Yada yada yada... boyfriend eventually moved in with me and long story short JNMIL has been giving us hell ever since, let’s just say her pack n play has not had any use.

Well tonight she texted Fiancé “apologizing” for “making” Fiance “buy the pack n play”... which roughly translates to “I’m looking at the pack n play while throwing away all your stuff  and feeling sorry for myself so I’m going to text you something that deflects the entire situation to make you feel sorry for me”

Am I reading too much into it? Her past behavior just sets this up to look like another guilt tactic. What do you think?"
510,"I swear if it's not one thing, it's another. 

So to recap, recently my ILs gifted my 2 yo son with a motorized dune buggy after my SO said no. SO talked with MIL, and the best she could say was 'Sorry you feel that way', so she is currently in time out regarding unsupervised visits with DS.

On to the post!

I was thinking that I needed to discuss guardianship of DS and future DS (coming this winter) in the event of our deaths. I don't believe MIL would allow any custody to go smoothly if I didn't have an official document set up.

While we're discussing our choices and the reasoning behind it, my SO says 'If your parents are on the list, we need to write down that it's contingent on your sister not living there or Mom would have a fit.'

Oh, did I perk up at that. Why is MIL talking to him about this? Why is he allowing her any say whatsoever in who gets our kids? And why is she targeting my sister? She has neither seen nor talked to my sister in years.

He wouldn't tell me exactly what she said, but it boiled down to the fact that my sister is a lesbian and has bipolar disorder. My sister has medication and sees a therapist. While I would not put my sister in charge of my child, the only danger in co-habitation is in him getting a hold of her pills. My husband also has dangerous pills, so I don't really see this as an issue. 

Flip side, apparently she wanted SIL to be in line. While a sweet person, SIL has suffered brain damage  resulting in very delayed maturity. I'm not sure I'd ask her to look over my cats for a long time, let alone a child. 

Ultimately I feel this is a ploy to limit my parent's access. She's very jealous of my parent's success and the good relationship my JYMom has with SO. I'm so mad that she ever talked to SO about this like she gets a say, and so mad at my SO that he didn't tell her to mind her own business. 

What my SO is taking away from this seems to be that he shouldn't have told me, not that he shouldn't have been letting MIL tell us what to do. I'm not sure how to have this discussion in a constructive manner. Thoughts?

Edit: I forgot; apparently my sister is also a lesbian because my parents are socially liberal. (Compared to ILs this applies to most of humanity). Clearly if DS lived with them he would become gay and/or transgender. Apparently the lesbian is contagious."
511,"Ex wants nothing to do with the baby at all. His parents have gone full stalker, leaving baby stuff in my mail box (no stamp) sitting outside my house for hours and even calling my work to find out my schedule. I've consulted with a lawyer who said what pretty much everyone here said: document everything.

I have screenshots of messages where Ex confirms that he doesn't want to be a father. I have timestamped photos/video of them staking out where I live, although in the last 2.5 weeks they've only been back a couple times. I got the case number of the call I made the first time I saw them, and I was able to get a recording of the call to my work (they get recorded automatically but I still had to pretty much beg my manager for the file) and I've been staying with a friend while looking for a new flat. I talked to my landlord who, after hearing everything that's been going on, was really good about it and helped me set up the cameras to see when they come and go. Landlord also said I can move out any time, has offered to refund my deposit, and has even offered to help me move out. Move is scheduled for the end of this month, assuming I can find a new place in the next couple weeks, but I've barely been home this whole time.

Then today I get a message from an unknown number. I blocked ExMiL's number on my phone because of all of the above behaviour. The unknown number tells me that they're going to be applying for split custody.

I called the lawyer, was on hold for the better part of half an hour, and after that I was told that all we could do was go through the custody process as normal. She said that there wasn't much else we could do, but said that the evidence I've gathered (texts between me and Ex, the audio of the phone call to work, the pictures from the first night and the video of the 2 other nights they were at my place) will help, but there's also a chance they'll be able to say that Ex's choices =/= theirs and then explain them stalking me as being ""concerned"" or something like that, which she admitted could work so she's prepared to actually go to court and fight them over this.  

She also thinks they're going to use being a single mother against me. My work has hours that wouldn't work well for childcare, so the plan was to move in with mum and resign, and then look for another job with more flexible hours or one where I could work from home, but mum has seen a car matching their one outside her house on more than one occasion and apparently they ""just happened to run into her"" at the store, so I'm not sure my mother's house is safe any more.

She says that Ex living with them could make or break the case, because if Ex says he doesn't want to be involved then they can't have the baby coming to their place, but if he says he's changed his mind (which he has before now when they told him to) and says he does want to be involved, then we're fucked. However they haven't actually filed anything yet because the text is all myself or my lawyer have heard about it.

In the meantime, all I can do is wait. And I hate it."
512,"My birthday is tomorrow and my husband (DH) and I had planned to go to a fancy 5 course meal restaurant( somethings we’ve never done), take our son over to walk around an animal farm owned by friends, and visit my parents for a little while. When DH told me his plans for my birthday I got really excited and have been looking forward to it all week. Unfortunately today DH told me that instead of going out and doing what we planned we have to go to his sisters senior soccer game and out to dinner with his parents.  Which we we supposed to do on the 18th. Seeing his family on my birthday is not something I ever want to do. So when DH told me the new plans I cried.  I was so disappointed and hurt that those are the plans for my birthday now.  I know it sounds silly to be upset about that but my in laws treat me like absolute crap. Just this month my grandmother in law, mother in law and father in law all came into the upstairs bathroom with my son  while I was showering and let him rip down the shower curtain and laughed at me for trying to cover myself. I’ve had to change the locks because mother in law made a key and was coming over everyday it was driving me insane.  Every time I see them it’s constant criticism towards me and how i raise my children. Just last week DH and I took Sister in law out to eat and I thought we had a good time and DH and her played Mario cart at mother in law and hers house. I was alone watching our two children and their house is not baby proof or kid proof at all so I was on constant run around mode.  While there mother in law texted me saying she bought stuff for the kids and I should take them I texted he back thank you and that they loved the toys. Right after we left DH got a text from Sister in law ( apparently I felt me water glass on the table and a granola bar for one of the kids..)  saying how ungrateful I am and how she shouldn’t have to pick up after me and how I should say thank you to Mother in law for the kids toys. And how they don’t have to buy anything for the kids.  She basically told DH he needs to put me in my place and I need to learn respect. Her and DH got in a fight and later DH mother and grandmother called to say the same things Sister in law said.  It really hurt to think that my mother I law would tell her entire family how ungrateful I am to her especially because I try my best to be extremely polite and nice with her.  Anyways sorry for getting off topic I just wanted to paint a picture on why I would be upset that I now have to spend  my birthday with my in-laws.  Whenever I’m with them they make me feel left out and unwanted, and completely horrible. But my husband feels like we absolutely have to go to his sisters senior game and than go out to eat at her favorite restaurant ( a restaurant I hate) to celebrate her being a senior.  I would be fine if it was just going to the game and then continuing with our plan on going to my parents and than out to eat But DH wants to spend all day with his parents and if that’s my only option I’d rather stay home. How do I properly explain to my husband how I feel with out sounding like a petty spoiled brat. And if I am being one please let me know.  I just want to stop this feeling of dread for my birthday. It’s not even my birthday yet and I already feel like it’s going to be horrible.



EDIT: just realized this is probably more for r/justnoso but I posted here because I felt you guy understood just no in laws best.



FINAL EDIT: so DH and I talked.  Because this game is his sisters last game and where we live they throw a special thing for seniors before the game where they call the seniors name and family comes into the field with flowers for the seniors, we have decided to stay for just that part.  Then go to my parents and out to eat at a nice restaurant just the two of us. I’m rising above and giving his sister 20 minutes out of our day."
513,"My MIL didn't like me. When I started dating her son she wouldn't even acknowledge my presence. I would say hi to her and she would turn her face away and leave the room with a little huff. I guess she would say things to him like I have too much baggage and am no good for him. It was a mix of classism and her being extremely attached to him. 

Over the years though she realized I wasn't going anywhere and started putting in effort. Unfortunately this took the form of her deciding that she owns me. She literally said that on a number of occasions ""teehee I own you!"" 

There was no respect for boundaries at all. When he still lived at home she'd come in ""just to talk"" while we were in the shower together. She'd tickle me, even when I was asking her to stop, which is the kind of behavior that sets of very bad panic attacks. 

When he moved out she would just show up sometimes. She'd call multiple times a day and guilt trip if all the calls weren't answered. She'd do the ""plan creep"" as I call it where it starts with going for lunch. But then she needs a ride. Then she needs shopping. Then drinks after. Then a ride home. Then well you may as well stay here over night. 

I could continue but this is already getting long. Pretty much the pressure has been a lot to take. We've been trying to set boundaries and they mostly work but not far enough and not soon enough. 

I finally couldn't handle it anymore and I broke up with him about 2 months ago, after 11 years together. Well, I didn't feel any relief at all. I just deeply missed him. And went through about a month of mental distress because going back seemed miserable and staying away seemed miserable. No good options at all. 

The point we are at now is that we are going to see a couples therapist. It may help us resolve the issues that ended things for us, or it may help us come to terms with this being the right choice. 

I think my biggest mistake was thinking it's okay, it will get better over time. Instead resentment and frustration built up so much that I couldn't even stand her asking innocent questions like if we'll visit for Christmas. 

I'm 30 years old, ready for that next step where you have your own family. I love this man so much, he is my best friend. It's so extremely frustrating that I may be walking away from all of that because of her. 

There's nothing specific I need here, I just want to talk about it. 

tl;dr// MIL sucks, I reached a limit, broke up with my SO, now we're going to therapy to see if that was the right choice or if we can resolve the issues

*I keep thinking I am the problem. You all telling me that my partner not making me the priority after 10+ years is a serious problem has made me realize that while I do have my own shortcomings I'm not wrong to be upset about how he handled things either. I've had a lot of doubt in both directions lately, and I'm still sure that therapy is the right choice, but thanks so much to all of you for reminding me that standing up for what I need is not wrong"
514,"FTP, apologies for mobile. I’ve commented for a long time, but never posted, and thought I’d share a short story about my Jocasta exJNMIL. This is many years ago, and the marriage is long over, so no advice is needed.

The exDH and I were renting from her while she lived in the basement apartment (because she lied about needing the financial help with the mortgage but anyway). We used to live in the basement apartment and it had a door that locked against the laundry room... the upstairs did not, and I realized too late she made us switch so she could come in whenever she wanted.

One day, the exDH and I are in the living room when she comes up and starts talking to him about the car we were selling. It was my car, in my name, from before I even met my ex... but she sat there with him and they talked about everything they were going to do to sell the car. Put an ad in the paper, websites to try, etc. Like I wasn’t even there.

Long before I’d ever heard of a Jocasta, sonsband, or emotional incest, I remember thinking it’s like they are married and I’m just his bedwarmer. It felt like I was an appliance, and all my things in her house belonged to her. A lot of her behavior flew through my mind as I sat there listening to them talk about how they were going to sell the car and what they were going to do with the money. 

Finally, I just said, “It’ll be hard for you guys to do all this when the title is in my name.”

She stopped and asked, what?

I said, “It’s my car, in my name, so you can’t sell it or see a dime without my permission.”

She CBF’d so hard I thought her face was gonna get sucked into the back of her skull, and she went back downstairs. 

I made us move out a few months later."
515,"SO has just got back from his ""family meeting"". From our discussion, it seems that we predicted most of what would happen.

First, his whole family tried to sit together, facing him. He called them out, saying it wasn't appropriate and they moved to a ""round table"".

MIL was dismissive of his concerns and made excuses for SIL who, despite knowing the extreme nature of SO's mental health problems (severe anxiety which triggered depressive tendencies) and that he's been seeing a therapist for almost half a decade, accused him of ""not being depressed because you go out sometimes"" (yes she'd been tracking his activity online and memorised a grand total of two outings with two different people..and presumably the times I took him out to help him get out of his own head).

Despite me not being permitted there, MIL apparently tried to bring up issues specifically relating to be and what she believes I've done (surprise surprise-- they didn't want to reflect on their behaviour or accept their pitiful treatment of SO). I'm so proud of SO because his spine is getting pretty shiny-- he told MIL if she's got a problem with anything to do with me, to speak to me directly (he thinks that he's bluffed her, but I'm preparing for her to call his bluff)-- SO also told his mother off for making nasty comments about my mother (not sure of her reaction here other than her trying to justify that she had been nice to me and helped me in some ways).

In response to MIL advocating for SIL's boyfriend, SO asked if she thought it was ok for SIL to have disrespected me and brought up her failing to give my birthday gift for about 3 months (he was told he was being petty... And they tried to justify her behaviour).

Essentially, as expected the whole conversation was about what he'd done wrong and them being unable or unwilling to accept their failings.

I need to shine my spine and be ready for MIL to come at me about my supposedly ""being cold""... 🙄 ... I hope I'm confident enough!"
516,"basically, I need to confront my SO about his mother and need some advice. I posted for the first time the other day about her and how she disrespects me and my wishes for our DD, intruding on our privacy and staying with us all the time. He just seems to sit there thinking she is God's glory and I want to communicate to him all the stuff that's been happening behind closed doors as such. I have terrible anxiety and hate confrontation. Any advice on how to tell him I hate his mother or ways to convince him to set boundaries? 
Thanks guys. This is my 2nd post!"
517,"Long time subscriber. This is an on-going saga that started on Mother’s day weekend of this year. I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and about done with the JN BS. I tried typing it all out in one post, but it just got too long so I think this will have to be done in installments. 

SO and I planned a small wedding ceremony for our closest friends and immediate family in early fall 2018. It was beautiful and perfect and there were only 14 people in attendance. Afterwards both mothers wanted to throw us a reception to include all the extended family and friends not invited to the wedding. We agreed that it sounded fun and asked for a simple picnic style reception to be held at MIL &amp;amp; FIL’s because they live on a beautiful piece of land with a small private lake for swimming and an outdoor kitchen/dining area. At the time she was JYMIL save a few BEC moments. The following is a timeline of how the party planning went down. 

Late January 2019 party date is set for second week in June. Guests list is made and planning starts. We meet for dinner and an early planning meeting in February so my parents can see the property. I got pregnant right around this time but did not realize it for a few more weeks.
Planning is delayed about a month when my maternal grandfather passes away. In-Laws attend the services and send a very thoughtful plant and card. 

A few weeks after the services I meet with MIL and my own mother for a lunch to divide up the tasks for the party. MIL wanted to make pulled pork sandwiches, salad, and baked beans and a few other things, while my mother is in charge of the rest of the food, dessert, and picnic supplies. They split the alcohol and soft drink costs as well.

Late March, invitations get sent out. This was my primary party job, however I am delayed by about a week and half because at this point I am experiencing terrible morning (all day) sickness. SO and I decide to wait until I’m 12 weeks along to tell anyone, including family, about the pregnancy because of a previous miscarriage. During this time MIL is calling or texting both SO and myself almost daily wanting to know why the invitations have not been sent out. 

In April we are waiting for RSVP’s to roll in and the mother’s start buying supplies. We make a plan to meet on Mother’s day to check in on where everyone is in the planning stage and to help the In-laws with some minor work they want to do on the property in preparation for the party.
Friday of Mother’s day weekend, MIL cancels our planned meeting due to inclement weather as most of what they want to do is outside. SO and I meet up with my parents on Saturday and his parents on Sunday because we had planned a little Mother’s Day surprise to tell them about the pregnancy. All sides are over the moon excited about baby. 

However like so many MILs on this thread, baby news is the first real JN moment from MIL. After her initial happiness she immediately starts asking about names. Half jokingly (probably) she suggested her own name for a girl, which is not going to happen bc her name is incredibly dated. But most annoyingly was her proclaiming that if we have a boy I absolutely cannot name the baby James (fake name). In her words there are too many James in her family already and it is set aside for the male line in her family. (She only has one brother and three sisters, her deceased father is a James, brother is a James and his oldest son is a James). 

I really didn’t have any intention of using the name. However being told that I was forbidden to use it without being asked if that was our plan rubbed me the wrong way because, A) my recently deceased grandfather was named James. B) my own brother is named James. C) the most recent James in their family is only 20-21 and not going to be having a child anytime soon and may not even choose the name James when it happens. 

In addition to the naming issue she starts handing out unsolicited child care advice/demands. The most prominent being that we are absolutely FORBIDDEN from giving the baby pacifiers because and I quote she hated how “they cover up their little faces.” I was a nanny for over ten years and have a bachelor’s degree in child development. I have taken several sleep safe courses in my studies and I know that pacifiers are recommended by a lot of experts for helping to prevent SIDS as well as just being an overall useful tool when taking care of babies. Needless to say I did not appreciate being told how I am going to raise my own kid. However SO and I attributed her behavior to her just being overexcited about becoming a grandma, (Our first mistake).

Back to party planning. We attempt to reschedule another time for SO, my parents and I to come out and help with party preparations, MIL cancels again. Followed by yet another rescheduling attempt, and another cancellation by MIL. I attempt to reschedule a 4th time, but am told that the In-laws have already handled everything....okay then. My mother and I continue to check in and see if she needs help with anything, but every time MIL declines our help and says “it’s under control.”

Which brings us to the day of the party...continued in my next post."
518,"MIL is 2 days out from being out of my life, she sits us down, grabs our hands, and tells BF and me that she is dying, literally her first sentence then the water works come on. I'm obviously not buying it and BF is just sitting there, I ask her what she means, what's going on, she said that her heart and kidneys are failing. Alright cool, I'm no idiot. ""What about them is failing"" I asked her, IGNORED. I keep pressing more and more questions, IGNORED, she releases my hand, completely turns away from me and directs her tears at BF, my face says it all and BF isn't buying it either. He tells her that my dad has friends who are all doctors and we can bring them her chart and get more opinions, IGNORED. She tells BF ""it just hurts so much \[BF\] I just can't explain, I've been getting treated for it this whole time they just don't know what's going on"" BF asks her ""Didn't they just tell you you had lupus 5 months ago???"" she tells BF that they thought it was Lupus then cancer and they were confused and it is really her heart and kidneys. SO I SAY ""That doesn't make sense how can they confuse major organ failure w CANCER all over your LUNGS, that's what you told us"" She side eyes the fuck out of me. 

I get up and leave bc I literally cannot w her bullshit and I go into the bedroom and I was not about to let her talk BF out of making her leave, over my dead body. BF comes in and he is pissed, he knows she is lying and is cursing asking who does that to their kid, manipulative asshole, blah blah blah. We go to bed he moves her out on schedule and I am free, I was so happy, we were so happy so much stress was gone, I could walk around my house naked again. Bless. 

At some point in time we find out I'm pregnant, after a day or two of stress BF and I are in bliss. Happy in our own home and MIL is away from me w her toxicity, we start making plans for our little family. Won't go into detail about the pregnancy unless you guys want, let me know. Do not come for me in the comments but this new life growing inside of me made me particularity forgiving, I made the decision in my head that if MIL goes to rehab and therapy I will allow her to be a part of our child's life. We take her out to dinner and break the news by giving her little baby socks as a present for her birthday, hysterical she cries, everyone in the restaurant congratulates us she thinks she is going to move in to help w the baby, no, she doesn't take the answer well but IDC. More time passes and all is well, until I get a call from BF. MIL is in the hospital, attempted suicide and she will be held and watched for 3 days to a week unless BF wants them to release her to us. NO. 

She is blowing up BF's phone for the next 2 days and even gets my mother involved and she calls us asking what is going on and that leads BF having to tell my mom everything that has happened w her and my mom decides to stay out of it and tells her that BF told her everything and she hope she gets the help she needs and she is praying for her. Bc she is a veteran some corporal calls us and tells BF that they will either have to check her into a facility or he will have to come get her bc they cannot release her to be on her own bc she needs to be monitored. BF goes and picks her up and she stays on the couch for a couple of days before leaving back to wherever she was staying. BF calls the corporal back and asked him what the details he was told that MIL called 911 saying she was drunk and was about to take a bunch of pills and that they needed to send someone to her or she would die.... go off in the comments what you think about that but I called BS you don't call the cops before you take the pills, they got to her in 3 minutes and to the hospital in 15. BF is angry but she is literally loopy off drugs and isn't responsive for most of the day.

next: Maybe I'm a brat but I thought I was the pregnant one, not her."
519,"DH and I paid for our son to get his first birthday cake smash photoshoot last month! Photos finally came in and they were awesome! We only asked for our son in the photos not DH or I but our photographer snuck a photo of my son and I while I was adjusting him for the photo, it turned out super cute and in the moment. I posted a lot of the photos of our son and then made the photo of my son and I my profile picture. My friends and family loved it and commented nothing but love about it, my MIL comments “MY son didn’t want to be in the picture with you?” I privately messaged her and explained that it was off guard that we paid for just him to be in the pictures but photographer just thought it was a cute moment. She says “k” I offered to send her every single picture and did, her reply wasn’t a thank you or oh that’s so cute it was the blue thumbs up reply on Facebook messages.... multiple of my friends gave messaged me commenting on what she put on my photo. Not to mention she has countless pictures of just DH and my son and never has asked where I was in the picture or cared... I guess I can’t just have a cute moment with my son without her trying to make it seem I only wanted us in the picture... I want to say something to my DH but feel like he will say I’m over reacting even though multiple people have said something to me about how rude it was and she didn’t even like the pictures just commenting on where her son was."
520,"Tldr: MIL told my Husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where I wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. Hubby and I are solid. She then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the Christian thing. 

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick update.  I got so many lovely, thought provoking messages from you all. Took me a while but I read through every single one, so thank you very much. You are all such lovely, kind and wonderful people. I really hope you are all so very happy in your lives.


To clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if I may). I'm not American, European born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. We met at his friend's wedding where I did the bride's makeup (I'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). We had some serious words, mostly where I told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and I fell hard. And you guys are so right, he is the best person I have ever met. He's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. Infuriatingly stubborn. And leaves his snot tissues everywhere. And he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. So I think I'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. He's just my world. 

It hasn't been easy. A few things have happened and I can't honestly say that I'm better off for it. But I'm trying.  Again, not a troll post. This is all unfortunately true and a little bit long so sorry for that. 

I didn't know how to tell him. Or what I wanted to tell him. A bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, I didn't want to show him ever. So, I told him I could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. They aren't particularly easy to read. Those men weren't very nice to me. They had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. And they had gone to jail.

He just got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. That I didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if I didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second I was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. He'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come about and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. He wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. He said he was so scared that I would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. And he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. They were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. Nothing malicious or accusing. 

I thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, a few nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. She'd taken pictures of the parts where I described things that had happened almost too vividly and then I had pointed out ways I could have defended myself and questioned why I hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way I looked and wanting them to do those things to me. Its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. It was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so I didn't have to think about the ways I could have stopped it. Maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all I had, I never went to therapy. She put in her message that I had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof I was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

His sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. And to the other siblings and some others in the family. Fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

Things haven't been going well. My husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. He's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. He won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. He owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. But I'm trying to get him to not do that. It's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. I don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

As for me, I'm just in a fog. I don't know how to process what she did, so I'm not going to until I'm ready. My husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. I think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. I'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. It sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. I hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows I thought like that about myself. I never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. Its just shit. 


Thank you all for your lovely words. I hope you take care.

Edit: his sister gave him my diary back and he gave it to me and I put it back upstairs in some old storage. I'll figure out what to do with it later."
521,"Haven't had much to report of late, things have been suspiciously quiet with Obliviouranus since the $100k bombshell. Maybe she's finally ashamed of her actions? Doubt it.


Regardless, I've been busy. Busy erasing her existence from my world. First it was the ""gifts"" she gave me, or in her case, the expected favours and silence she bought with material possessions. To the charity shop with them. Then it was the gifts she'd given DH and DD. Constant reminders of her, not mine to dispose of. But I sure as hell didn't want to see them and be triggered every time. Into a case and stashed far out of sight and mind. Photos on the walls came down next. Swiftly followed by deleting any photo or video with her evil face in it. Deleting all historical comments she'd made on my social media (even after being blocked those comments still exist fyi). Delete delete delete.



There are still little things that pop up every now and again, and I absolutely adore erasing them from my world when they do. I'm so glad this community exists to strengthen my resolve when time has passed and things are quiet. 5 months NC feels good. Erasing Obliviouranus feels even better."
522,"I'm not mad at him, this is just a rant about JNMIL. It was her birthday yesterday and DH's dad urged him to give her a call. I told DH he could if he wanted to, but to not offer up any information on my pregnancy or the baby, just wish her a happy birthday and be done. 

So he called and nobody answered, and he said he left a ""happy birthday"" voicemail, but that he sounded very exhausted and sad in it. Of course she called back almost immediately. She's had 3 months to contact us to apologise or about me being pregnant with her first grandchild, but she only leaps when DH reached out to her (eyeroll). Yeah. Okay.

I wasn't there for the phone call, but DH said she just monopolized the whole phone call talking about herself and her life, didn't ask any questions whatsoever. Like, lady, you haven't talked to your firstborn son in over 3 months and you get one birthday call and you just talk about yourself? She didn't even ask about the baby. DH had to cut her off because it was eating up his work day. He said right before he hung up, she tried to apologise, which we both agreed felt very hollow after 3 months of silence and no effort to reach out. And we also both agreed that DH shouldn't call her again. 

It makes me so mad to see her break her son's heart over and over again."
523,"I’m so so tired of my mother. 
I got caught having sex with my best friend in my room (I live at home with her). Obviously, my devoutly Catholic Mexican mother was absolutely fuming. She’s picking up the pace on the abusive control tactics she’s always used. 


She’ll randomly call me at random times that make no sense, for absolutely no reason other than to see what I’m doing and make sure I’m ok. This would be acceptable if I lived in another state and she called me once a week. I live at home, only go to work and school because I don’t have friends besides my bff, and she will make this call multiple times a day. I’m 21 years old. 


Anyways she made this phone call today but I know she did it to subtly harass me about what happened. Ever since she caught us, she’s been yelling at me that I’m not allowed to have anyone come over, no visits, nothing, any chance that she gets. I had to tell her I had just barely gotten home from school and was about to take a shower to show that there was nobody home. She told me condescendingly she was on her way home as we speak bc she got to leave work early and that when she got home we were going to have a talk. (“A talk” LMFAO okay). It’s been 4 hours and she hasn’t showed up, she works two jobs so she’s OBVIOUSLY at her evening job. And she’s done this before. She keeps lying to me to scare me, It sucks because I can’t sneak out to see my best friend because I don’t know what’s real and what’s not real. I don’t know when she’s lying and I can’t assume she is because it’s too risky. She hates him and has never trusted me even before I knew him. 


She’s always kept me pretty isolated, I’m kinda used to it and it’s not a huge deal because I’ve never really had more than one or two friends at a time anyways. But this is the most isolated I’ve ever been since I was in middle school, when I was never allowed to hang out with anyone outside of school hours. I hate her. I don’t love her because I very very firmly believe that love is an action; if ur not doing it right ur not doing it at all. so by that logic, she pretty much loves me even less than I love her. 
Im so tired of being isolated, I’m so tired of being watched so closely, I’m tired of her intimidation tactics. She’s gotten into my head and I don’t know what’s real and what’s not real. I’m too afraid to do things that are easy to get away with because I’m afraid of what she’ll do if I do get caught in a lie, even if it’s very unlikely. I’m so fucking tired of being treated like a child. Im pretty positive she genuinely believes my physical existence is 21 years old but everything else about me is 7 years old. 


The thing I hate the most/ my favorite fucking part!!! I want to leave so so badly. I have at least one place I could be couchsurfing at if I were to just take my toothbrush and car keys and leave right now. But I can’t make myself do it. She’ll do or say something to make me do it, and I’ll end up back at home again, absolutely humiliated with myself because I’m a coward and couldn’t stand my ground and say no. 


The only thing that’s motivating me to call my big sister and live with her is the fact that if I leave I won’t get dragged to church anymore LMAOO anyways. Yea. U know how in abusive relationships sometimes the victim stays and refuses to leave even if they recognize and acknowledge that the abuse is happening? That’s how I’m feeling rn. I feel like I’m trapped."
524,"*Previously with Attention Vampire: she told us she was taking a week off to ""help"" with the new baby. Readers of r/JUSTNOMIL weighed in and gave their advice.*

My husband and I finally learned how to change the garage code. We're also getting a security system, and we decided to also get a door hardening kit for unrelated reasons. But since part of the door hardening kits involves taking apart the doorknob, we're also getting new locks. We decided that our peace of mind is more important than trying to reason with someone who doesn't know boundaries."
525,"Just as I was working up the courage to block her, I'm seriously so close to being ready! Anyway, my sister and I got a sob story text about how she can't even drive because of all the tears. Then she sent this gem:


""If you think for one minute that I'm not terrified, not in despair you are wrong.  Is this forever?  Because I dont know what you are thinking.  I do think you are purposely trying to break me.  You think I deserve this.  What did I do?  I had a nasty meltdown during duress.  I've apologized up one side and down the other.  You have dug your heels in against me.  Against your mother.  My only other option in my mind is going to be that I just show up.  So do expect a visit.  This needs to stop.""


It sent my sister and I both into a panic. My sister was luckily gone at work and had plans with friends all evening anyway. But I was home alone for a bit so went next door until my husband came home. Sister texted dad to let her know what she said and also told him she isn't welcome and that we are prepared to call the police if she shows up, and/or seek a restraining order. 

He argued with us for a bit saying both sides are out of hand and overreacting but said he'd call her and try to keep her from visiting us. 

She sent a big long freakout text about restraining orders well, here, I'll just copy and paste it. 

""Restraint order?  Really?  You are out of your minds.  I'm beginning to think you just want be victims.  Oh my...my mom has emo probs...protect me...she just might come by!  And then you would.have to be real.  Because you are.not.being real at all.  The rules?  Fuck your fucking rules.  A counselor.with the 2 of you?  Right!  Last time that happened I asked for a personal letter.from each of you.  Instead, you ganged up on me and picked me apart.  And the goddamn counselor.let you get away with it.  I will.NOT put my self in that position again.  I would.be willing to go to individua counseling, like I said.  That is the absolute best I can do.  Restraining order...you are out of your minds.  Do you even realize what that means?""


Am I crazy or is this really mean of her to say? For context, she is referring to the last time we tried counseling. Eggs had asked us to write her letters to her that outline our issues. My sister and I decided to work together on one letter that was worded very carefully. When we read it to her Eggs blew up and called us ungrateful. The counselor tried to point out to her that we might be afraid of her anger. She refused to go back after that. Now she wants to do one on one with our counselors.

My sister sent a text to dad (and me) saying she will only be willing to do one on one with mom's counselor. Because otherwise she'll just say we're ganging up on her.

This was my reply:

""I might be willing to do the same, after talking to my own counselor for a while and potentially having my counselor talk to hers to see if she is even ready for that. This is going to take time. I haven't even been able to get a real session in with my counselor, first ones on Wednesday. Does she even have a counselor cause she seems to go back and forth on whether or not she's seeing someone. Telling me how dare I suggest she get counseling and then suddenly saying she's seeing a specialist? And then going back to saying she refuses to go to counseling. Can't trust a single thing from her right now. I'm focusing on trying to keep my own shit together. Why are her feelings the only ones that matter?""


No reply on that yet. Oh yeah, and also during this, Eggs sent a message to just Sister saying that she will be coming over on Friday at 8 am to get the garage door fixed. That thing has been broken for like four years and just now it needs to be fixed? Fuck that. My sister has since found out that even though my mom is the landlord, my sister can still legally deny her entry to her home. She's let dad know that, so she feels a bit better. She does have a friend who is cool with her staying with them if she needs to, so she has options. 


This morning, we found out that Eggs sent messages to our family-friend group saying that our annual Christmas party is cancelled because of my sister and I. So now she's trying to turn other people against us. She's a real 🍑.

Edit: thank you so much for all the amazing advice and support. I'm a little overwhelmed and can't respond to everything but just know I'm really taking it to heart. Also regarding counseling: I know for sure that she isn't currently ready to do counseling. So I'll need to know that she has done the work first. I want to at least try, but will definitely be talking about it with my therapist first. She might advise me the exact same thing as y'all, and maybe counseling isn't the way. But I'm not fully ready to say that I will never have a relationship with my mom again. I'm just not ready for that yet.

Edit: Fucking hell. I just got back from hanging out with my family friend group (the ""kids"" of the group- they are people that we call siblings, though my sister and I are the only ones related by blood. We're all adults- I'm the youngest). My brother showed me the text she sent out about the party being cancelled. It's really infuriating. She said our normal Christmas festivities won't be happening this year because her daughters have decided to take a restraining order out on her.(which is not true, we just said that we would if she pushed us to) She also called us stupid (""I'm sorry my daughters are so stupid"") and specifically asked for them to talk to us about it. I'm beyond livid. Brother 1 didn't respond at all, and Brother 2 just replied to her that he is going to stay out of it, and what's going on between her and us is our business, and he won't be picking sides. I love them, they are so wonderful and supportive. 

My sister and I did write out a letter to dad and sent it. We stressed that we would like to continue a relationship with him but we won't be talking about our rift and also explained that counseling will only happen after she gets counseling for herself and is ready to hear what we have to say without getting defensive and lashing out, and we may need to have our counselors communicate with her counselor to gauge whether she will be ready and whether we will be ready. 

I hear you all on being careful about counseling. We are going to be very careful and guarded, but we want to try to get things to work- but it's on her now to do the work first. Another thing I'll need to bring up with my counselor tomorrow is that someone very close to my mom is dying. He's been dying for a while and I was expecting to be able to be there for her when he goes. Well, looks like he's getting pretty damn close. Obviously, I can't/won't be there for her, and I'm feeling all kinds of feelings about it and I'm scared."
526,"This is an old story but it recently came up again in conversation with my mom. 

When my DS was young, I was still pretty much in my trying to please MIL phase so I was still on speaking terms with her and still trying to get her to like me. She would give a lot of unsolicited advice and I would basically grayrock (grey??) my responses. She would also come every so often and babysit. On this one occasion, me and DH had just started a new business and needed someone to watch DS for the whole day while we worked. 

DS has allergies so I made specific food for him and had it all set up in the refrigerator prepared to eat when ready for each meal. We left around 8a but I fed him before we left. I told her all this info and showed her where his toys were and iPad so he could watch a show or two but nothing more. I thought all was well and at the time I especially thought this because she had 4 (3 of which she mostly raised) kids so this would be easy peasy. 

I would call and check in every 2 hrs and given updates that he’s doing well and all is fine, they are having a great time. He would also say hi mommy. I’m good. So great! We keep working. By the time we get home, it’s 10 hours later and close to bed time. I walk through the door, and immediately my son runs to me crying saying he’s hungry. I’m like oh okay maybe he ate through everything I prepared. To my horror, I open the fridge and ALL of his meals are still there. I say immediately, why is all this food here. What did he eat?! This woman said I kept asking him was he hungry but he kept saying no and kept playing iPad. I screeched, YOU ASKED A 3 YR OLD IF THEY WERE HUNGRY AND DIDNT FEED THEM FOR 10 HOURS BECAUSE THEY SAID NO?!?! Plus you let him stay on the iPad for 10 hours?!?! 

I was beyond pissed and brushed passed her to feed my kid and calm him down for the night. She didn’t tell me one time on the phone that anything was wrong. I ignored her for the rest of the 10 min she was there. Didn’t even let my child hug her goodbye. That was the last time she watched my child longer than an hour and she only did it when it was an extreme emergency. Now she can’t watch either of my kids AT ALL. Emergency or not, they are coming with me if need be. 

Now to why it was brought up. My DH is turning 35 in a few weeks and I can’t find a babysitter so I can take him to dinner. I was talking with my mom about it and how I would never be asking my MIL. My mom then says well you can’t hold that against her forever. I kept repeating back “I can’t hold it against someone who starved my kid for 10 hrs? Is this what you are saying?” My mom kept saying that’s not what she meant, maybe she’s changed in that regard. I just kept repeating myself and said you don’t get more than one time to do something like that to my kids. I can see if my DS was older and could make his own food. But he was 3 and couldn’t even pour his self something to drink let alone open the fridge easily. 

My MIL is an all around JN but my moms past JN is peaking its head through a lot more lately with her comments. She becomes real touchy on subjects that involve my MIL and I think it’s because how stern I’ve become and she doesn’t want that to ever happen to her."
527,"Hey all,

Just recovering from the Canadian Thanksgiving. I love to host every year at Thanksgiving - I cook a big turkey and invite about a dozen randoms over to eat and make merry. I always invite all my family, including my mother who if you check my post history is mildly just no. 

Do any of you guys have a relative that you know will always be invited for family gatherings, but every time you do so you have to mentally prepare? My mom is that relative in our family. She's sweet, and tries to help out, but instead tends to trap people into conversation and overstay. Last year for Thanksgiving I literally had to kick her out after she refused to leave because she wanted to hang out with my roommate, who was too polite to run away and lock herself in her room. 

One thing my mom does is yell. She gets excited and doesn't know how to rein it in. Thank god she doesn't drink or smoke pot because she's bad enough sober. 

This Thanksgiving is leading up to a mini concert my mum and I are both performing in. My mum was gleefully yelling across the room to one of my other guests about how I was performing, what I was performing l, and about all the other performances I have been in. So I asked her not to yell out when I was performing, as I had sent out Facebook invites. So she side eyse me and starts yelling even louder about how she's also performing in this show. Then she says, loud enough for me to hear, "" I WON'T tell you wñhen snarkisms is performing, but I'll be there.""

I love my mum, and when you put her next to my racist, misogynistic, and overall toxic father, she's a saint, but she tests me constantly. Not only that, but she's getting older (mid 70s) and I think her mental faculties are slipping. She still functions alright, but it's getting harder to be gentle around her, and I know it's 100% on me to make sure the friction is at a minimum. My mum can handle a certain amount of feedback on her behaviour, but it's always something my family has to be over the top straightforward with her, because she can't (or won't) acknowledge subtle indications that she's boundary stomping. 

Anyways, I hope all the rest of you Canucks on this sub enjoyed your turkey day. I was very thankful for my family, including my mum, even though I was much more relaxed after she left. We started a game of cards against humanity and that drove her out of the house.

TL,dr; my mum is mildly just no and brings boundary stomping to all the holidays."
528,"So my MIL has no real sense of humour and takes so much of life seriously....unless it's her joke, in which case she likes to throw her head back and use her awkward forced laugh to make it clear she thinks she's hilarious.

So my husband and I met playing a team sport and it's a huge part of our lives still, 6 years on from meeting through the sport.
Last year I was preggo and had to miss out on playing for obvious too-large-to-run around reasons. I was up for playing for our club's ladies top team and I had worked so hard on my fitness and skills only to have to sit on the sidelines while I grew my wonderful babe. That's a privilege, I know, I loved being preggo!! Meanwhile DH has been playing for the men's top team for 3 seasons now. JNMIL is super proud of him and talks about him like he's an elite athlete. (Sometimes I think DH believes this just a bit...!)
Little one is 7 months old now and I was discussing getting back in the game with my DH and JNMIL. I said I was going to find it tough getting fit enough whilst breastfeeding the baby and trying to find people to watch him while I play.

JNMIL took no time to jump in and tell me that now I'm a mother I just have to give up my lifestyle and just take care of LO. Apparently my priorities will need to shift to find a different way to spend my weekends and I can't expect to maintain the life I have. Maybe I should just be happy to play in a casual way and turn out for the bottom team if it works with my DH's games so that he can do childcare on the off chance the two games are compatible.
She basically gave me her outdated sexist point of view, telling me that having a baby is self limiting, because I'm a woman and that's my role.
I'm a feminist and I'm not falling for it.
At no point did she or DH suggest that DH could give up his lifestyle. So I suggested that maybe after I've taken a year off playing, maybe it's DH's turn to do the same... DH says that he would think about it but I've not asked...oh, so I have to ask him to step down for me because he's not going to offer... JNMIL just reiterates that it will be hard for me to play as she doesn't want to push the idea that DH should have to be compromised.

So the good news is I'm back in the game, playing for the top team (DH continues to play for his usual team) and our club members have offered plenty of support in it. So many of our friends have been keen to watch baby for us so we can get on the pitch. It's working so well. I'm just really pleased I knew better than to listen to my JNMIL and tell her she was wrong....

So we had a family do this weekend and JNMIL was visiting our area with her brother and his wife. They were asking me about my job and how it is going now that I'm back full time. I tell them it's all going great and I'm loving my teaching allocation. I'm lecturing first year medical students and have recently put in an application for a teaching qualification.
Great stuff, they say. Then my DH's uncle asks what I want to do long term and I say I sometimes think about applying for medical school myself because I just think I could do it. Half joking, half wistful, but basically I don't have a plan as I'm looking to get anther grant for future research and will hope to have a second baby in that time. In reality I know that studying medicine might not be impossible but it wouldn't be a good time to do it.

Well JNMIL didn't give me chance to even explain... She just jumped straight in... Well you've got a baby now and a mortgage and more university will just get you into debt and how will DH support you all while you do this... Etc etc... 
Fucks sake, firstly I'm not exactly serious about going to do it. But Jesus Christ I know why my DH has such self limiting view on himself sometimes. The woman does not know how to give people a chance, or even make a light hearted joke. She just goes straight in to tell you straight you CAN'T do something and tells you straight why she thinks it.

Now I'm considering it just to piss her off....."
529,"Hi Guys,  

This is an update to my post from yesterday ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dhu4i9/mil\_the\_book\_of\_faces\_and\_how\_she\_has\_earned\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dhu4i9/mil_the_book_of_faces_and_how_she_has_earned_an/) )

Firstly I want to say thank you for all your comments on my last post. I have read them all, and will endeavour to reply.

So my mental health took a battering today. I don't know if its because I'm over tired, hormonal or just had enough. I dropped DS1 off to school and burst into tears, and I've been very upset on and off all day. Luckily for me I was able to work from home and  have some time for myself. Anyway wine and chocolate is out for the moment (pregnancy and gestational diabetes!!) 

DH rang me on his break and I was a mess. I admitted that MIL's last few messages have annoyed me, and that I don't want to see her on Sunday. I basically said that her FB message made me fell like she was saying that I should suck it up. He agreed and said that I'm not comparable to SFIL, obviously he is not so ill on the medication that he was having stomach cramps and worried about losing the baby. DH reread her text and said it was very 'me me me' and that I ""don't have to deal with her, she's my mother. Just go out on Sunday and don't be home when they are around"". 

Success you might say. Yet DH rang later and was worried that maybe I read her message the wrong way, maybe she was just trying to say that she understands what I'm going through (face palm). I told him that her message wasn't helpful, and that she made my anxiety all about her. That its us that has lost a child, and she should be more supportive and not make us feel bad for her. 

We have been together for 14 years, and been to hell and back together and survived. A number of people, including our councillors, have all commented that we have a solid marriage. I love him so much, he is my rock in times when I cant be strong. 

So I had decided to go out with my sister on Sunday and  not be around when she is here. He knows not to talk about my delivery as I don't want her to know anything about it. Yet JYFIL wants to come with JYStepMIL and see SIL. Now I feel like I should be here and see them as well. 

I also feel like DH comes out of the FOG, then does some other thinking and get's re-submerged. I mean he knows that his mother is a nightmare, but I don't think he can see how manipulating she is being. 

My question is what do I say to bring him around? This group is my sounding board (I know that I don't have it as bad as some other members, and other posts and comments have already helped me). I haven't told anyone at all that I post here, so I don't want him to read my posts really. 

Thank you once again!"
530,"TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of suicide.

Recap: I'm in my late 20s and my JNMOM (Artsy) has near complete control of my life. She's emotionally and verbally abusive and I'm virtually a prisoner in my own home. I'm currently seeing a therapist in secret and plan on escaping by January. 

I've been having some anxiety fueled nightmares about leaving. I'm not getting cold feet or anything but it's just hard to shut up that little internal voice. My whole life I was terrified of my mom. Everything I did was motivated by not angering or displeasing her. But I've realized I've ""disobeyed"" her many times and nothing awful happened. She's so consumed with projecting this image of us being the perfect family that she can't really go to anyone when I act out. Because that would require her to admit something is wrong in the first place. 

When I came home on my 21st birthday with two tattoos she yelled and screamed but that was it. When I came home blackout drunk she didn't tell a soul. When I overindulged in edibles she didn't speak to me for days. Which was basically a reward in my book. When I tried to kill myself she told everyone I had dehydration. It was never spoken about again. 

Every time I feared the worst but nothing really happened. I stayed this long because she had such a strong mental hold on me. In my eyes she was something akin to a god. Her word was law. This belief was so deeply ingrained in me that I couldn't even realize she never had any power in the first place. 

My therapist says it's common for abuse victims to blame themselves once they see their situation clearly. So I know it's not true but now I feel so stupid for allowing this to go on for so long. I can't help feel like a smarter, stronger, saner person would have left a long time ago."
531,"I don't really know how to begin this. I'm on a throwaway.

I still live with my mom. I recently got my first ""real grown up job"", but due to some ill-advised retail therapy on my part, it'll still be a few years before I can leave. My current plans are to pay off my credit cards, pay off my car, pay off my student loans, and then save up enough for a down payment on a house. (I have an odd pet that makes getting an apartment pretty much impossible).

Back when I was a teenager, my stepdad was just incredibly inappropriate towards me. Photoshopping my face onto pornographic images, picking the lock to my door when I was changing for bed, his computer passwords were ""SexyKoricopatNow18"", etc. Lots and lots of sketchy shit.

While they were divorcing, long long long story short, we discovered a hoard of my undergarments in his room (They'd been sleeping in separate rooms since I was about thirteen). The oldest was my first training bra, the newest was a pair of underwear I'd bought earlier that month that had some menstrual blood on them. After recovering the hoard, I threw it all away. All of it directly into the trash.

When my mom found out I'd thrown it all away, I got screamed at for being ""wasteful"", and there's no reason we couldn't have just washed them. I tried to explain how utterly creepy and disturbing I found it, and was informed that I was being dramatic and ridiculous and wasteful.

A few years later, when I worked up the nerve to confront her on that, I got another yelling at. Apparently expecting to have undergarments that my stepdad has never jacked off in is ""exactly the same as expecting to have hospital linens that nobody else has ever used"" (that's literally the analogy she used). I'm still being dramatic and ridiculous.

Part of me, a big part of me, wants to make another attempt. It's been a few years since, maybe she's gotten a bit more perspective. I don't know. But I'm also worried I'd just be dragging her over the coals for something she can no longer fix. I don't know how much it would help me to hear her at least *acknowledge* that expecting me to keep jizzed-on undergarments was fucked up, but I do feel like it would help.

I'm also worried that I really am being dramatic and ridiculous about something that's not that big a deal. Am I the JN here? Should I just shut up and let it lie?"
532,"Hello,   I would like some advice.  I’ve posted here a couple times in past and your comments are always helpful. Thank you 🙏🏼 

MIL is not an obvious mean lady like you see on movies but very manipulative and selfish.

Currently, we block her on our phones. So we won’t get any messages or calls at all. She called her daughter(my SIL) saying she’s worried about her son and told her to call him so she knows what’s going on(she tried to use her daughter). Unfortunately, she treated her daughter the same way as she did to me, she and I ended up having a long conversation to show understanding each other instead. 

It’s been very peaceful since we cut her out of our lives. I know it can’t be permanent, at least for SO,  but it’s nice to stay away from the drama so we don’t have to deal with the fights. 

Tomorrow is SO’s birthday. Now, MIL’s husband texted both of us asking SO to unblock her so she can make a birthday call. Also, telling us this breaks her heart so much. 

Also, tomorrow is our first couple counseling. We hired babysitter for our 3yo daughter and I’m thinking about taking him out a short birthday lunch. 

I really don’t want to deal with this right now, especially right before the counseling and date lunch. While the MIL did selfish things around me or behind my back, I lost trust in my SO, got fights so many times, cried and lost weight. And now, she got heartbroken? To me, another selfish behavior from MIL and the husband. 

The reason why I blocked her was because she treated me like I have a hormonal mental issue after I made a confrontation about her selfish behavior. That’s what she told my husband when she called last time. She encouraged him to talk to my OBGYN. 

What should I do?"
533,"My MIL _begged_ for pictures. She would not stop bothering DH. So he, being the best husband, refused to give her digital copies so she wouldn't put them up on Facebook because neither of us are friends with her and we hate that she lives vicariously through us. We took a trip to the drugstore and chose what we wanted to give her. It was all harmless portraits of the family (no candids) and it was mostly pictures of her and DH's side of the family. We were in unanimous agreement about not giving her our favorite picture: me crying as DH did his vows because I _knew_ some way, somehow, it would end up on Facebook.

About a week later I was hanging out with my mom, who said ""I have something to tell you"" and absolutely lost it laughing. It was a few minutes before she could speak and then she told me this:

""DH called me in a panic a few days ago and told me not to tell you this because he doesn't want you to be upset, but MIL posted your wedding pictures on Facebook.""

DH is very smart, but he wrongly assumed that if we gave her PRINTS they wouldn't go up on social media. (He said, ""Who even does that?? She's not THAT dumb!"")

That's right: she _TOOK PICTURES OF THE PICTURES_ with her little iPhone and posted that! They have glares and just don't look that great. We only found out because of SIL who IS friends with her on Facebook (I don't know why because MIL just tags her in shitty things and says ""look it's you"", but those are stories/rants for another time lol).

This is why (per my last post) we only allowed her to take a picture of the backs of our heads 😂 I've deleted my FB so she can't keep messaging me and her flying monkeys can't keep friending me, but she's genuinely addicted to social media and I won't participate anymore."
534,"After my FMIL dramatics of banging on our front door and crying etc after my FDH didn’t answer his phone. My FDH has decided to go NC with FMIL and FFIL. He wants a restraining order as well. If they show up on the property they will trespassing. We didn’t go over for thanksgiving and he refuses to see them. FDH mentioned last night that FMIL and FFIL use to make him carry loads of bricks when he was nine and do hard manual labor. My heart broke for his nine year old self. FMIL and FFIL treated a little boy like a man instead of a child. He also said FMIL isn’t going to live forever and it’s already too late for anything to change. 

Apparently FMIL went to the hospital on Monday and FDH found out from someone at work since FFIL and FDH work for the same company."
535,"Tl:dr at the bottom
Backstory--
I have posted a few times on here in regards to my mother. I have since started therapy, my therapist says it sounds like my mother may be undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder. Obviously she cant diagnose someone else but she feels that might explain why I have such issues with emotions in  general. This whole therapy and temporary NC started back in July when my mother mention coming to visit me and meet her granddaughters for the first time ( I have a 2 year old, 8 month old twins and am currently pregnant which she is not aware of) I panicked and sent her a message saying I need time to work on the issues that her and I have and for her not to contact me I would contact her when I was ready. Well that did not go down well, she immediately started trying to video chat me. She would try to call with various family members present to manipulate me into answering. It did not work. 
Now my step dad has been present since I was 3 he himself is an enabling justno (if one can be both?) But growing up I thought he hung the moon because he ""chose"" to be my dad after my real father died when I was an infant. I was super close with his mother. My grams. I spent almost every weekend with her for the majority of my childhood. She is the reason I loved art, and whatever various hobby she had at the time. She was amazing. The love and validation I did not get at home, I got from her. I love her like people say they love their mother. I feel no love for my mother. My grams was my mother figure. Since a small extinction burst when I moved out ( read as: escaped) of my mothers house and moved to my current state and got ""eloped"" to my wonderful husband. My grandmother has always said she would always support me. But in actuality has backed out or had unspoken strings attached on everything. She has repeatedly damaged her and my relationship and I have always been the one to rug sweep and make amends because I dont really have another mother type figure. 
Present--- 
I have my mail set up to receive an emailed image of the letters and packages that are being sent to me. I check it every day. I checked it today and had a panic attack instantly. My mother sent me a birthday card. I couldn't breathe. I started crying. I thought my mothers father may have (he is willfully ignorant about his daughter, but doesn't let that interfere with our relationship, we just don't mention my mother) so I called his wife, my mothers setp-mother, my grandma. Now this grandma is a no nonsense lady and sees right through my mothers shenanigans, but my grandpa will not hear and unkind word about my mother so it falls on deaf ears. She is my most trusted confidant. I was kept away from them for most if my life because of previous parenting issues my mother had when she gave up custody of my older sister. I called my grandma in tears. She said no she would NEVER give my address out when I made it abundantly clear that I cannot be in any kind of contact with my mother. And my grandpa didn't mention it, which he would have. So it wasn't them. Then my grandma tells me that  the last time they talked to my mother, my mother told them that I do not want them in my life right now, and that I'm in therapy. Well full stop. My grandpa did not know o was in therapy and my grandma certainly didn't tell her. Only other person I could think of was my grams. So I sent her a message asking if she did. I got back "" your dad(stepdad) asked me for it because he wanted to send you money for your birthday (aka manipulation). I gave it to him. I hope you understand. They will not show up there. They are in no position to travel anywhere."" Okay so is that supposed to fucking make me feel better?!?! Like I dont even know what to say. I then asked her if she was the one that told them that I was in therapy and no reply as of yet. I am so mad. Our relationship was already awkward because of her before. I cannot trust her again. I was no where near any type of progress in my therapy sessions to deal with this. I'm hormonal. I'm emotional. And my birthday was Sunday, so they are late. Which isnt that much of a surprise, but I'm still upset about it for some reason. To top it all off, we could really use the money. It hasn't arrived yet, but once it does I plan on taking it to my therapist and deciding what to do with it there. But we need things for the twins that we've been putting on hold. I want to send it back up opened but I feel like a bad mom for doing so. Ugh I was looking forward to not dealing with the guilt trip birthday cards. Sorry for the emotional, unorganized rant. 
Tldr- My grams betrayed my trust, told my mother whom I'm no contact with, my new address, and that I'm in therapy because of her. My mother then takes it upon herself to send me an unwanted birthday card."
536,"This is my 1st post, I’ve been with MIL’s son (bc everythang is HERS) for 7 years. Her antics have been ongoing since day 1. But after an unannounced visit yesterday I have to get things off my chest, I’m welcome to all input!  So my husband’s family is Hispanic, like he moved from South America at 18. At the beginning of our relationship I excused a lot of things as a “difference in culture”, here we go...

My biggest bitch right now is that she wants my daughter to call her “Mami”... my daughter is 18 mons old and obviously cannot spell. So to her “Mami” and “Mommy” is the same damn word. I have explained until I’m blue in the face that I do NOT appreciate this.  I’ve repeatedly corrected her “Abuela” or Abuelita” and explained to her why. But she continues to call herself “Mami” when I’m just out of earshot, or when she’s on FaceTime (her sons phone calls).  She did it again yesterday, again I corrected her and she laughed at me, “you need to learn Spanish” which is true i have picked up some Spanish but not much. They are fluent. Mostly b/c now our communication is limited and that’s how I like it! But I know enough to know that grandma isn’t Mami! My FIL is no better, he’s just sneakier. They brought themselves lunch when they showed up yesterday and basically he told me to serve them. (She’s in a wheelchair bc of a recent surgery or she would have).

FIL is lazy. Hubs has same habits. MIL does all cooking/cleaning. My mother had to teach my husband to use a dishwasher once when I went out of town because he was out of clean dishes. He calls me the male version of my name sometimes as a dig about my weight. And says that he’s referring to my height. I’m about 2ft taller than him and 3 ft taller than MIL. She (on several occasions) has told me I’m fat. Once took it so far that I didn’t speak to her for several months. But as she cannot/will not/ and is not expected to apologize in her family it became so annoying after she changed the story to blame literally everyone but herself! The only reason I had any clout w/ the family on that occasion was because my brother in laws (BIL) girlfriend was there and also called fat. 

She constantly makes comments that I don’t cook enough, I feed my kids too much sugar, my house isn’t clean enough, etc.  I am a stay at home mom but I also homeschool my 8 yr old son (from previous relationship) that has learning disabilities. I also pay 80% of the bills from my child support and side jobs. So when my in-laws try to remind me these things are “my job” I am quick to remind them that their son DOES NOT support this family. And he should and will help around this house. 

My son, she barely acknowledges my son. My FIL used to be very affectionate and loving to him but it has slowed down since my daughter was born. I also have a step-daughter. When she’s with us for the summer MIL will buy both girls presents and leave my son out completely. Once on his BDay. When I took the presents from my stepdaughter (my daughter wasn’t born yet) and told my MIL in front of everyone at my sons BDAY PARTY that it was inappropriate to bring presents for any child but the birthday boy to his party and she could have them another day. To say that went over poorly is the understatement of the century. 

I’ve been writing for so long and barely scratched the surface of her shenanigans. Insulting my mother about her parenting skills, (my husband and his brother were both primarily raised by nannies), calls and expects my husband to drive 2 hours to do every little chore for her. Even though his brother lives 15 mins away and my FIL lives in the same damn house). Steals my FB photos of kids and posts them as if she’s with them and took it so everyone will “oooh and awe” about what an amazing and engaged “Mami” she is 😒 She’s fucking relentless. I need this woman and her little flying monkey side kick out of my house, marriage, family AND life! I would appreciate any suggestions especially those with in-laws from different cultures. I’m going insane!!

One last! She just sent a text wondering why I won’t let her get my daughters citizenship in their country!?! Are you F’n kidding me??? So you don’t kidnap my child and take her to a country where I have NO legal rights and don’t speak the language?!? Agh. She’s nuts!!!!!"
537,"\*\* I'm back! This time re-visiting the past, sharing random things that she has done here and there. I posted about the birth of our children and showers in Post #1. Post #2 was about our disastrous wedding. #3 was current events and now #4. Random things throughout the decade.

&amp;#x200B;

Father's Day about 4 years ago-- I decided I would make step-FIL a gift (MIL hosts a party on Father's day for him. MIL has only boys and they go along with whatever she says). The gift was going to be ""from DH &amp; my children to Papaw."" I also do a gift from our children to my husband and the other grandfathers; same for the women on Mother's Day. Anyway, I found this adorable idea on Pinterest: a glass container filled with nuts that says on the label ""Nuts about (insert grandparents name here)"". I thought it was adorable! I sent MIL the picture and told her that I was making this for step-FIL. She said it was so cute. I asked her what brand and type of nuts does step-FIL prefer and she told me salted peanuts. I made my father a similar one with a different type of label and Reese's Pieces inside. Altogether, I spent quite a bit on these gifts.

The day of the ""Father's Day"" party at MIL's came and after hours of socializing and eating (she always drags out her parties. Always.) it is FINALLY time to open gifts. MIL says ""It's gift time! You HAVE to open this one first. It's from all of the grandchildren."" Meaning, our children, BIL's children and step-FIL's children's children as well. He opens the gift and..... it's a store brand jar of salted peanuts with a piece of paper slapped on it that says ""Nuts about Papaw!""

I felt my eyes start to burn. I quietly slipped out of the room and texted my husband to grab our gift and I stayed outside for a bit to cool down. How could she do that to me? I was so embarrassed and upset. DH ended up giving our gift to step-FIL anyway, after everyone had left. Step-FIL gave him a knowing look and said thank you. Ours was definitely nicer but she could have at least changed the title of the label.

She looooves to steal family traditions from her children. For instance, when I was a child, my mom would have my cousin write ""Letters from Santa"" to us. We loved it! So when I had children, I would type up letters from Santa too; to do with my kids. At her annual Christmas Eve party, what did she type out and thus read to the children on Christmas Eve? You got it--- Letters From Santa she printed offline. To make it worse, they didn't sound remotely believable and my stepchild asked me if Santa was real; because of her letters. I started throwing her letters away. She tried it with my SIL-- my SIL has ""Christmas Eve boxes"" and MIL took some to her house and dropped them off. SIL called her and screamed at her and threw them away lol To which MIL then calls every member of her family and shares ""her side of the story"" which is always tailored to MIL's ""truth"" which is always the same: MIL does something nice and no one appreciates it. Always the victim. 

We went on vacation one year to visit my mom. My husband has a feeling she would try to use the emergency key he gave her to access our house while we were gone; so he changed the locks. 4 hours after we arrived on vacation (7am on a Saturday, mind you) she calls repeatedly and left texts and voicemails screaming at him for changing the locks. He asked her why she would try to come inside our house without us there? She hung up.

While we were driving home from that vacation, I received a heartbreaking call. My beloved cousin was brutally murdered. I told DH to tell his mother because she was hosting a party for the next day and I wouldn't be there. I had to make calls to family members. I get a message from MIL ""Sorry about your cousin. You're still coming to the party, right?"" (I know DH told her no). I told her no and she attempted to push me into coming anyway. I didn't. She was being insensitive. 

My BIL met his now wife in a very... not so great way. His now wife was his ""other woman"" while he was with his ex. MIL loves his ex so she despised now-SIL. DH and I felt it wasn't our business so we were nice to SIL. Which infuriated MIL. She wanted us all to hate her. MIL's mom would write horribly nasty stuff on SIL's facebook page. Calling her a zit on (ex-SIL's ass, etc). MIL banned SIL from coming to her home. Until one day, she was just suddenly over it. Idk if it's because she changed her attention onto me or what. But she would insult our ""friendship"" as often as she could. Eventually, she would ask SIL questions about me and use her words against her to spin it into something else and cause conflict between us. She only wants us to get along on the holidays or her parties. She wants us to hate each other any other time because she feels threatened. 

She likes to try to assert authority over my SS. I've raised SS since he was a baby and we have sole custody. But MIL tries to pull seniority and override me on everything. She's made arrangements for him and only him (meaning without our other children) without asking us first. She and ex-SIL will buy him things but not our other children. Without asking DH and I first, she has bought him expensive electronics such as: a hoverboard, a drone, a 4 wheeler, etc. But our other children get cheap toys or secondhand clothes. Which would be perfectly fine, if she wasn't shelling out hundreds on a single toy for SS and that would be one of his MANY toys. 

She was livid when we reconnected with DH's ex wife and slowly eased SS and BM into a relationship. She would say awful things to us, awful things about BM. She was mad we wanted them to have a relationship. DH told her it was none of her business, but every birthday and holiday she would bitch that BM wanted to spend an hour with her child; because it usually meant SS leaving a little early. So behind her back she says awful things about her. But to her face and on social media she will tell her how wonderful she is. The two faced part of her drives me mad. 

We were moving into our first home (we were renters previously). I was very pregnant so I couldn't move heavy boxes. DH asked step-FIL and MIL if they would want to help. MIL told him no, she had to work and they couldn't help. She told him multiple times to find a friend to help. So he asked my dad and brother, who agreed to help us. Moving day comes and MIL says ""I'm on my way over."" DH asked her what she meant; he had already asked my dad to help because she had told him repeatedly that she could not help. She loses her mind on him and said ""You should have known I would help! I've never left you hanging before! You're ruining everything, doing this with HER FAMILY!"" (Like I told you in posts 1-4, ""HER FAMILY"" is her go-to insult.) She wouldn't help until my dad left. Although I was salty about her tantrum, I thanked her for helping. She ignored me. So I told her again, in front of DH (I was testing a theory) and she ignored me again. I told her a third time and she finally huffed ""Yep."" She later told DH I was rude and never thanked her. Although DH reminded her sternly that I had, 3x in fact, she replied ""No, she didn't.

It's honestly amazing I've lasted this long without flipping out. She can be tolerable for a time but it never lasts long. She's cost us a babysitter and has tried to get us in trouble at work before by blowing up our phones or calling into work to ask random questions. But after a long talk with my husband, I have told him I am done dealing with her. I only talk to her if it's absolutely necessary. Otherwise, I ignore her messages. I have her blocked on social media now, I will only go to her house for a family get together if I feel like going. I know the confrontation where she demands to know why I'm not kissing her ass is coming. And thanks to you guys, I'm ready for it."
538,"My mom wasn’t the best mother in my life and as I am coming up on some important milestones in my life, (college, moving to a new state, becoming an adult, being in my first serious relationship, etc.) it is becoming more difficult than normal to accept that she isn’t and doesn’t want to be apart of my life. Any advice on how to cope with this?"
539,"As the flair says, no advice wanted. Just wanted to kinda get this off my chest.

So, Ice Scream recently had a birthday. Which, as usual I do not acknowledge. DH went to see her (alone) and I go on about life. DH and I got to talking and he was saying how she has some stuff for ""us"" and how she can't get it here because she has car issues. 

She has had car trouble since the end of last year. She keeps telling DH that it's a factory recall, but she needs HIM to take her to the dealership. (Fun fact- She took the car to **our** mechanic and **did not pay him**. In an entitled attempt to stick us with the bill). So naturally, I feel like she's lying. It's not a recall. She wants DH to go so that he will foot the bill. DH's uncle, her brother, told her not to buy a new (to her) car because she can't afford it.... I guess she figure DH could. 

So DH said when he got there she brought up the car again. To which he claims he told her that if she's waiting on him to take her to the dealership that she's wasting her time. Of course she tried to question him about why he won't just do it. He told her that she likes 5 minutes from her sister, BIL, nephew and niece. She could also ask her boyfriend to take her... and that it's ridiculous that she has let that car sit for almost an entire year, because she feels it's his responsibility to take her (pronounce foot the bill for her).

Next, when DH visits her, he typically goes during times where the kids are in school and I'm at work.... or when he has something to handle in her general direction (kill two birds with one stone kinda thing) and he goes alone. 

She had the audacity to ask where the kids and I (thought I highly doubt she asked about me, that what he says, so I'll go with it) are. He tells her school/work and quickly steers the conversation away. 

Like seriously lady. I haven't stepped foot on your property since 2006. NOW you want to know where we are? And her lame excuse that she can't come see the kids, or when she has something for DH/the kids he has to come get it because of her car troubles... It's funny because those car troubles don't stop her from driving her ass to the airport to go see her GC/GGC. She still keeps true to her words... she always told us that if we wanted her to have anything to do with our kids, we have to do all of the work.

She can go to hell. My kids are better off without her.

\*BONUS: DH is trying to talk her up as \*gags\* ""Grandma... every time he says something in reference to her and uses the term 'grandma', (for example: Your GRANDMA brought you some cookies!--He always emphasizes the word grandma) they just stare for a minute like a deer in headlights. Why? She's been MIA their entire life, now you want to talk her up like she's the best thing since sliced bread. THEY DON'T KNOW HER!!!!

Petty? Maybe... but their reaction makes me smile every time.

Play bitch games....."
540,"We went NC last October after MIL went too far with speaking to us rudely (to put it nicely), calling us names, and overall acting completely out of line.
 At the time she had a save the date for our wedding which we took with us out the door as she screamed at us. Since then she has attempted to come back into my husbands life by showing up at his work (in the parking lot and going into the store) begging they go to therapy together and that “she can’t do this”, sending him long text along the same lines, etc. it’s straight up crazy ex girlfriend behavior. We’ve been civil at family parties, saying hello if she initiates and never bad mouthing her to family. Relatives didn’t even know we’d gone no contact until she started bad mouthing us to everyone and anyone who would listen, which we found out through said relatives when they’d bring this up concerned and to express their support and sympathies to us. We stayed firm, she was not invited to the wedding and I was scared she’d try to crash. Day of she sent her sister, my husbands aunt, a long text saying how dare the aunt attend. (Aunt’s daughter was our flowergirl, and she is going through a terrible divorce and has been nothing but strong and lovely to us, meanwhile MIL can only think to send her sister nasty text for “not supporting her in these hard times”. Since the wedding has come and gone in August she’s thankfully left us alone, instead she now just takes to Facebook to post photos and memes about her sadness and heartbreak over missing her son.

Today she posted this:
https://imgur.com/a/9z2Tp4Q

Everything said and done, we’ve never been happier or healthier since going no contact. We’re married, moving into our first home in a month, and my husband has built a stronger bond with his dad and stepmom without his mom planting seeds and bad mouthing nonsense about them in his ears!

TL;DR Just no MIL has taken to posting about our no contact on Facebook, we continue to thrive regardless of her online drama"
541,"Here's a quick recap post for those who may not have seen it.....

[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ddcuhh/let\_me\_count\_the\_ways\_just\_no\_moms\_crazy/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ddcuhh/let_me_count_the_ways_just_no_moms_crazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

She sent me a text a few days later to see if I wanted to meet to talk about what was bothering in. I told her that I needed to first talk to my therapist but that I would keep her posted. This past weekend, my daughter was invited to a pool party and her friend's mother is a friend of my mom's. I let kiddo go, I was working anyhow and was interested to see if my mom would happen to be there. Sure enough, my daughter mentioned something about my mother being at the pool party. 

I sent my mom a text today to let her know that I was thinking about meeting with my therapist a week from Friday and her response was that it should be fine. She then asked if she could have my daughter sleep over this weekend. I said I would think about it and she gave the whole ""you said you wouldn't keep her away"" blah and I simply responded that she just saw her on Sunday. Suddenly, mom is concerned about the rest of the family seeing her too. 

My ex is coming into town at the end of the month and staying (again) with my parents. Unless something miraculous happens, he'll be here without a valid license because the state suspended it yesterday for lack of child support. I'm sure he's acting as though that's not the case and I'm to blame and blah blah.

So, I'm going to go no contact with my mother. She loves my ex so much, she can get all her information from him. She can see my daughter when he's in town and all of that. It'll just be like he has custody and she lives out of state. My question is about the rest of the family.

One brother was invalidating about this time last year and said that I can 'pull' stuff with my therapist but that he lived in the same house. His wife made a nasty passive aggressive remark to me a couple months ago- she was upset I didn't ask about my 2nd niece who no one even told me had been born.

The other brother hasn't been involved in any way as far as I know. Our interactions have been civil. My grandmother also lives in the area and she's not really spoken to me about things recently but I don't feel like I can trust her not to speak to my mom about stuff.

What are the logistics? How to I draw out the actual expectations and parameters?"
542,"I (M30) am looking for some advice on how to help my partner with everything going on with my MIL. Sorry for the length. 

Some backstory on my girlfriend  and MILs relationship (told with permission). Girlfriend was horrifically abused by her family while growing up, the worst being her dad breaking her back.  Every boyfriend MIL had abused girlfriend and she accepted it because she wanted MIL to be happy. (She was told by numerous abusers that is she took the abuse that MIL would be protected so she has this protection complex.) Because of how bad the other abuse was, Girlfriend didn’t notice how bad MILs mental and verbal abuse was. She thought that they were best friends and there MIL was amazing by comparison. 
MIL got diagnosed with depression a few years ago. Girlfriend moved home to take care of her single handedly for a few years and we recently moved in together in another city. 


We have been together for four years and I have watched my MIL get steadily nastier. GF always justified it as MIL being stressed or more recently depressed. She always joked that MILs personality depended on who she was dating at the time. Last year MIL met the “man of her dreams”, everything seemed great at first and we were very happy for her. Cut to a few months ago, MILs antidepressants stopped working. My GF noticed that she wasn’t doing well and begged MIL to go to the doctor. While MIL was going to the doctor, GF talked to her brother and MILs BF about what to expect MIL to do (she has been through this more than once) when she changes her medication. Namely, that MIL will not want to take her medication and will get nasty, she stressed that they needed to make sure that MIL took her meds because she will ultimately thank them for it. 
The doctor appointment went well and MIL was given new medication, was signed off work, and was told not to make any big life decisions until they found the right mix of medication. 
The evening after the doctor GF got a text saying “I am not taking my medication, I am going to cure myself with soy milk.” My GF has experienced this with her before and called MIL and tried to convince her to take her medication, eventually begging but MIL just hung up the phone. GF texted MILs bf, her brother, and her sister and told them that MIL was refusing to take her and asked if they could get in touch with her and present a united front. When she got no response she called them and they didn’t answer. She spent the night texting and calling MIL and eventually fell asleep in my arms. She woke up to a text from her family telling her to stop bullying her mom and if she wanted to cure her depression naturally then to let her. GF was distraught. After intervention from the Doctor MIL started taking her medication but MIL said she would never forgive my GF for bullying her. After a few weeks the medication wasn’t showing signs of working (we don’t know if she was actually taking it for lying) so GF asked her to go to the doctor again. MIL begrudgingly went and got new medication again and was again reminded not to make any big life decisions. 
Two weeks ago we were woken up at 2am with a phone call from MIL telling us that her and her BF are getting married next month and will be using their entire life savings to rent out a whole hotel and will be flying the whole family out to the hotel. GF was shocked because MIL swore she would never get married again but thought that maybe she has just found the “one”, she congratulated her and we went back to sleep. The next day MIL called GF to express her disappointment that we weren’t happier for her but asked her to help plan the wedding. GF, who had been worrying about this whole thing most of the night, said that planning a whole wedding in a month would be nearly impossible. She asked if they had thought about delaying the wedding for a year or so, that way they can plan her dream wedding and it gives her time to find the right medication and not have to stress about a wedding. MIL insisted that they were getting married next month, GF finally had the courage to remind MIL that the doctor told her not to make any life altering decisions. That is when the sh*t hit the fan. MIL screamed and hung up on GF. 
A few hours later GF got a text from MIL and her BF saying that MIL realized that my GF has always been a saboteur of MILs happiness, was the most selfish person in their lives, and wanted MIL to be alone and unhappy forever. The text ended with us being uninvited from the wedding and GF was told to leave them alone.  There have been subsequent texts just attacking my GF and everything about her, saying she faked her disease and wasn’t actually abused, you name it. 

My GF is so devastated. She has been there for her mother her entire life, she took hits because she thought it was going to protect MIL. She thought she was her best friend. Even if her mother was awful to her she was the most positive (and only) family member she had (she has been disowned by everyone else for not being quiet about the abuse). In my opinion by GF is so much better off without MIL in her life, she is a toxic person. My GF sees this but she is still so upset. What can I do? How can I be there for her? Should I keep pushing that I think this is a good thing? 

Thank you for any advice you can offer."
543,"This is more for entertainment than anything as I’ve put MIL in a TO for now. But if anyone wants to know what I deal with, here you go! 

1) About a year ago, DH and I took a trip out of the country. After we came back, MIL called DH and asked him about the trip. DH told her how he had such a great time and how we honestly might move there given the chance. MIL flips out and yells at DH, “You can’t move to China (it wasn’t China...🙄),  my grandkids won’t know me!!!”  We have no kids. 

2) My MIL bought a piece of property in DH’s hometown to plan for us to “eventually move back when we have kids.” She said it’s for us to build a nice house on and then add a separate MIL apartment in the back for her and FIL to retire to. Property is in DH’s name and everything. 

3) Same property with DH’s name. She goes through a similar story with BIL and his gf  except BIL doesn’t work so now it’s changed to “We’ll build us a house and you guys can live in the apartment and when you have kids, we can switch.”  

4) My e-ring’s middle diamond was given to DH to use by MIL. She feels entitled to grab my hand, inspect it and reprimands me on “washing it.” The diamond has a high fluorescence which means in certain lighting it’ll appear foggy. I never wear it now and I’ve told DH I’m giving it back if she keeps it up. 

5) My MIL is buying BIL’s gf breast implants.

6) MIL wanted us to buy her some filets since the places near her are out(?). DH and I don’t eat red meats. After we gave it to her, she packs two of them up to give to us to take home even thought we haven’t eaten red meats for 3 years. 

7)MIL keeps on stating that “she could’ve been a doctor.” While she mixes her antibiotics and takes them on and off because she thinks they are painkillers. 

8) I told MIL she needs to stop smoking, start doing more exercise and to eat healthy. MIL tells me, “I ate a tomato. I eat them all the time.” 

9) MIL wants us to move back to DH’s hometown and tries to convince us by telling us “Your city doesn’t have a -insert preschool DH went to-!” The preschool was torn down before DH graduated elementary school. 

10) We were driving to spend thanksgiving with the whole extended family. DH and I left late and though we were close, we were still on the highway. BIL calls DH and starts yelling at him because MIL heard ambulance sirens in the distance and thought we were dead in an accident. (????????)

Bonus: MIL wants to split her ten acres, build two more houses and having DH, me, and BIL (and whoever he’s with) to live in a compound. With her. Forever.  (don’t forget about the grand babies!) 

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk."
544,"This is a 7 year old story, so that's why I put no advice wanted. I just want to make you all cringe.

I've been married almost 7 years now. My first year of marriage was a doozy. Why you may ask? 1 guess, my MIL.

She wanted to see her son on our honeymoon, and he was like, no mom. She wanted me to pop out grand babies, nope. Not to mention I was in full time school, and, could not deal with crazy. So, she'd call my husband at work for the stupidest things... There was a spider under her fridge, and, she called dh at work, and asked if he could kill it for her...

One time I was really sick, and she invited him over, and he said no, OP is sick, and she said O, come by yourself... We'd been married a week... Yah sure Jan... Sure.

She even told my husband she missed him so much, she was waiting for him to come see her..
And then she started to tell people she did not know how were doing because we didn't call her. Crazy person, we're married all of a month....

Then, we got a dog... O good gravy... Her opinions were nuts on that. Our dog but another dog, and we had to put surrender her (don't worry, she was rehabilitation with experts, and, was fine)

Ooooo and then she gets a flying monkey involved, and thst caused a major problem with my husband and his best friend....

I truly feel she took away my first year of marriage away from me.

Things are slwoy getting better now, sort of. I think it's because she wants to be my mom, but she's not, and, she trys to assert herself that way."
545,"Tw transphobia

So I spent the better part of the last 3 months travelling for work. And when I got home stuff was different. DFW had JNMIL sleep with her and JNMIL took the liberties to mess with my stuff. Minor stuff like taking videogames off the room to big stuff like removing a painting a friend made me. My best friend in the world is a trans woman and made me a sign when I moved that said something like ""This house welcomes all people with love"". It was handmade and it was the one posession I would save from a fire , it means the world to me.  JNMIL took it down and I cant find it. When I confronted her about it asking where it was she said I should be thankful she hot rid of it because it was hideous. I insisted saying it was important to me and she made a ""joke"" implying I was having sex with my friend while misgendering her. I must have sat there for about a minute in silence shocked. And not really proud of what happened after. I called her some bad names, she called me some bad names, FDW cried a bunch.

I got home and SO was super apologetic she knew how far JNMIL had crossed the line. I didnt say much, just told her to tell her mom if she ever contacts me again im going to the police(idk what I would tell them, but seemed right) and that if a wedding is going to happen JNMIL wont be there. FDW changed a bit after this implying I was going too far and that she couldnt get married without her mom there. I stood my ground and said those were my conditions and I understood if she needed time to think or change things, I just wouldnt be harrassed anymore"
546,"On mobile. 

I deleted my original post because I got kind of paranoid about one of my in-laws finding it since it was very descriptive about them. 

Short version is that we found out that MIL had taken back FIL and had been outright lying to our faces for 8-9 months about it. Husband confronted her about it (one of her friends contacted husband about it through Facebook telling him that she had been lying to us and had stollen TVs from them) and MIL told him that it was all his fault he lied and accused him of never making an effort, even though he called once a week to check in on her after FIL left her and two of her children stranded in a state homeless with no money about 20 hours from any one she knew. 

We went no contact and blocked her on FB. He didn’t block her phone number because he has two young sisters that still live with her AND we thought that since she was lashing out/acting fucking insane it was a good warning system if she ever tried to come to our house or anything. 

She has texted DH a couple of times to tell him that she wasn’t going to contact him anymore (Sure) but then we went about 2 weeks without any messages so we thought maybe she had given up. 

Well yesterday husband got a text from her. It was just a picture of him as a baby. No words or anything. Just a picture. It was weird in all honesty. And made me feel a little unsettled. I’m probably over reacting but this woman has me on edge. It’s like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop, especially with all the holidays and my daughters bday coming up. I feel like one of these days I’m going to open my door to find her looking back at me. 


So yeah other than the weird picture message not much has happened. Husband is still staying firm and saving copies of all her messages (but not responding) in case she makes a threat or we need to file a restraining order against her. 

Sorry this ended up being so long. The picture thing just really bothered me for some reason and I needed to get it out. 

Thanks for reading if you made it all the way to the end. 

Edit: I do agree that it was just a manipulation tactic, but something about it just really has me uneasy. Lol. I’m probably just really paranoid about it because as soon as I saw it I just got this really bad feeling. 

I want to thank you all for your responses and for taking the time to read all of this. It means a lot and I love having a place where I can just let it out."
547,"VENT ahead:

My JNMIL needs to have control over everything. How much information we receive about sick relatives, where holiday's happen, what we are aloud to complain about. I'm just so tired of battling her. I have tried to go NC or VLC since there are multiple family members in the hospital but she is just acting horrid and acting like we are being stubborn rude little children. 


Here is where it starts - DH and I have been in couples therapy for a while now, around 8 months. Most of our therapy has focused on his relationship with his family and how he does or does not support me. Other parts of our therapy has been the therapist validating that I am upset or bothered by his mother's actions and helping lift the fog for him to verify that she is, in fact, making belittling comments, inappropriately comparing siblings, demonstrating obvious favoritism, and attempting to control when and how we see them. 


After GFIL fell and was in the hospital and they didn't tell us for several days because ""There was nothing you could do anyways"" my husband spoke up and said that we would like to know so that we can make our own decisions about how we can help or visit. Then when he went back into the hospital (that is 10 minutes from my work) I tried to get information from JNMIL who just ignored me (like she had been doing for the previous 2 months) so I called GFIL's SO to ask if I could stop by. Suddenly JNMIL is responding to my texts saying that it's not worth it to go because of traffic (WTF?) and that he wouldn't remember me so there's no point. Umm... hell no, there is a point to supporting someone I care about in the hospital. The point is so that they aren't alone! After I see him, I call DH and tell him its not looking too good and he needs to come out. DH comes out, I give them space. Then we call MIL on the way home to update her on our visit. I shared that GFIL was very easy going, even said I didn't need to fix his pillow but I did anyways because it was basically on top of his head and obviously not comfortable.


Well guess what y'all - I'm violating his autonomy because I fixed the pillow. Between that and calling the GFIL's SO, I am apparently a very rude person who doesn't know my place because MIL called my DH to whine about me and asked him to set talk to me about it. Okay - so I can't do anything right obviously if fixing a pillow and calling a family member is out of line so I try to go NC. 


CRUX OF THE ISSUE:

GFIL is in a rehab facility for pain management after 2 hospitalizations in less than 1 month. We get some sporadic updates - MIL is reinforcing that if we want updates we need to ask. But we can only talk to HER. So she is gate-keeping the information. GFIL falls at his rehab and goes into the hospital on Sunday night. She waits to tell us until the next day. DH and I talk about how we might have tried to change our work schedules around to see him as it was a holiday for many people. But she took that away from us. DH is sick MIL being an inconsiderate gate-keeper and asks if she can let us know when big things happen, like hospitalization, with a small text he tried to show compassion by saying ""I know this is stressful but we don't need a big update just like a FYI heads up."" 


Her response: ""NO DH'sname. I will talk to you about this text later in the week."" 


DH is just so mad at this point, but I encourage him to reach out to ask his dad if she's okay because that was a bigger response than he expected. J(N)FIL says 'We both thought your text was inappropriate"" 


Am I insane, am I the just no? Is it inappropriate to ask that we be updated when someone goes back into the hospital? I guess he was transported on a stretcher and kept in a collar until a full body scan could be completed. That seems like big deal - his 3rd hospitalization in a month. 


On top of all that, despite JNMIL/FIL, SIL w/ her BF, and GFIL living within 5 miles of us, MIL wants a Christmas vacation. When we said we didn't want to travel and wanted to be relaxed on our holiday, SIL sent an email back 'Well driving 2 hours to see your family is really no burden at all.""  Please. you live 10 minutes from me, why do I have to drive 2 hours to see you? WHATTTT. DH has stated our plan and will continue repeating: ""We are not travelling we have made our decision."" 


I don't know what to do - advice would be helpful."
548,"Just as a little background on my relationship to my now fiancé, as well as my mother: My fiancé and I have known each other for almost 9 years now. Here’s the fun part: we met online! I live in Pennsylvania, he lived in Texas, we found each other as friends when we were 13, started internet dating at 15/16, and for a year he saved money from his job towards flying over to live with me after high school (we happily own a comfortable little house together—we’re on our own of course.)

We are both 21 now, he was very eager about engagement but we both agreed to wait before we made any drastic decisions like that, to make sure we worked out in person as well as we did online. We became caught up in our lives as individuals, time flew by, but last month on the first day we met in person, he popped the question at the same airport we met at as well, and just happened to be passing through to have a little getaway vacation together out of state.

As for my mother, like I said: fiancé and I started internet dating around 15, and she didn’t like this at all. Looking back now I understand it, as I will admit my fiancé in his teenage years was not the best person, getting into the usual teen things they tell you to stay away from. However, he matured very quickly and is the complete opposite of who he was before.

Buuuut, my mother still holds her grudge from years ago. She’s always been unnecessarily overbearing, overprotective, and excessively naggy. Again,I could understand her being overprotective of little 15 year old me back then, but I’m a full on adult now and so is he. Moving out of the house was a challenge of its own, not because she wasn’t ready to let me go but because she knew once I had my own place set up that my fiancé would be with me, and she didn’t like that one bit. She would wiggle her way into my house hunt and lie to landlords about me and insist I was the last person that should be renting a house for them and would come up with lie after lie, even going as far as pulling up pictures of worn down houses and saying “She did this, this is how bad she is at cleanliness.” (and they would somehow believe her.) The only reason I have the house I’m in now is because I found the landlord online, we would communicate through there, she sympathized with my mom situation and let me look at the house at night time so that my mom was unsuspecting. It was practically a dream house for a starter home, and I took up the offer immediately.

Jumping forward, fiancé flies over. It was about three weeks before he was “formally” introduced to my family—it would’ve been longer but she got her side of the family to stalk my social media (because I have her blocked) and they told her about how him and I were together now, and she paid us an unexpected visit, along with her boyfriend (who was both equally as unsupportive) and her cousins. It was like a big group of protesters outside of my house.

To try and make things run as smooth as possible, I let them all in without arguing and we sat in our living room—the tension was absolutely dreadful. She tried being nice to him and so did everyone else, but that quickly diffused into them all yelling and her gossiping to them all about things my fiancé used to do when he was 16 as if it were things he did just yesterday, and she did this right in front of our faces too.

My fiancé tried to handle it and reassure her he was a changed man in a calm manner, and immediately she pulled out the race card. He is Hispanic and I am White, and she said things to him such as “You’re a dirty Mexican that’s all you people know is drugs and being crackheads, you are filthy, you’re too good for my daughter”. Her family got quiet, I’m assuming because even they thought that was too far, and my fiancé was at a loss for words as well. But me? I was invoked with the most burning rage, and was screaming at her to get out of my house.

Contact after that was very strained, we would all come together on holidays but her and everyone else attending would purposely make us feel unwelcome and uneasy. And then comes our engagement—I made sure to avoid taking it to social media, but after I had posted a casual selfie of us on a date from our vacation, one of my coworker friends I had told the day I got back decided to comment “Congrats again on the engagement btw!”, which my mother’s family saw quicker than even I did, and life was immediately hell again.

The past month has been nothing but her and her little sheep of a family’s bickering, constantly harassing my fiancé, trying to get us kicked out of our house and even trying to cause trouble at his job. She’s gone absolutely insane, and it’s been making my fiancé severely depressed, to the point where a few nights ago he asked me if I wanted him to just call off the engagement so that our lives could be easier, or even worse—us just break apart completely and me find an SO that my mom would actually support. After that night, I haven’t been sure what to do, but I am definitely going to do whatever I can to ensure the happiness of my partner. We are both very busy with work, school (for me), amongst other things, and haven’t had time to properly look into what could be done to help us.

Any advice?"
549,"Backstory: MILs siblings live many states and a plane ride away. Even before she got here MILs sister was interfering by getting MIL worked up about stuff (meeting my family, going on and on about how “pictures are forever” so her dress better be good, etc.) They are both overbearing and bossy. We got engaged after 5 years together.

Everything was seemingly fine with MIL until the wedding. There had been a couple comments made between engagement and wedding that in hindsight showed they were sent over the edge by us ACTUALLY getting married. Long story short of how this became apparent, aunt decided to be a COMPLETE drunken (and as we later found out, also high) fool at the rehearsal dinner which did not even have an open bar and which she 100% did not even need to attend. Husband ripped her a new one the next day so logically, on our wedding day, MIL spent the entire day worried about how her sisters feelings were hurt. This includes 1. pulling step-MIL aside to show her the text I sent MIL saying aunts married boyfriend we’d never met wasn’t invited and 2. telling my family I made way too big a deal out of aunt drunkenly poking someone in the eye.  I found out later on from my family who was seated at the same table as my husbands family that his grandma announced to MY aunts that she has never liked me, likes everyone but there’s just something about me she don’t like, and my husband could have done better. I’m 100% convinced she decided to say this AT MY WEDDING because she was pissed that her poor babies feelings were hurt. His family sat there and trashed the decor, the food, my family’s clothes, and the wedding cake. I also found out that at the bridal shower his mom made the comment to a group of people that she had asked my husband if he was sure this was what he wanted and she just thought he would end up with someone more in to sports (?). It’s been months and I can still barely stand to look at MIL. I don’t know what I want from this post really, just confirmation that they are insane I think. Any articles etc. that would help me get through the next two months of holidays without being a complete bitch to them are welcome."
550,"Update from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dbbe9x/mil_put_me_in_the_hospital/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

The day of the second phase bed bug treatment JNMIL assumed she and FIL were having dinner at my house. I put my foot down and said no. They tried to invite themselves over the next day. I said no. I told them that no one was coming to my house until it was settled and everything was back in its place because I’m way too stressed trying to unpack my entire house by myself to add entertaining people on top of all that. This was a week ago. DH has mentioned that his mom has been “mopey” on the phone. Yesterday I was attending a wedding and JNMIL knew I was going to be gone and went ahead and invited herself and FIL over for dinner. I told DH that I already told her that no one was coming over until the house was settled. His best friend was present when this conversation took place and backed me up. Now DH is pissed at his mom for going behind my back like that. He’s so close to seeing her for who she really is. She keeps messing up and he keeps getting glimpses behind the curtain. I flipped out on him and told him that he was prioritizing family dinner with his parents over my life and I don’t want to die before he realizes that he is screwing up. 

On the matter of my health- my memory is still not super great but my stress levels are getting better. A few of my friends did not realize how bad things were and are doing what they can to help."
551,"I haven't seen her since the end of 2009. We barely spoke or texted. She learned she had cancer and broke all contact with me. I only knew because my cousin told me... much like with her death, I only knew she died because same cousin told me. 

My kids don't care that she's died. They don't remember her. I feel like I did my job protecting them.

So now she's dead. And I'm still blocked on her Facebook. And I feel so angry and bitter and I'm fucking PISSED her parents and sister told the entire family.... and only the one cousin saw fit to make sure I knew. I'm her only freaking child.

Hell, her power of attorney called to make sure I knew. So did a nurse who had cared for her. 

That one cousin is the only one I've kept in my life. That won't be changing.  No fences have been mended at this time. Bridges will remain burnt to a crisp. 

My mom was very much a JustNo. I've posted before. I did have a meal in her honor tonight....

Backstory: my mom was working and my stepdad at the time and I got her fast food for lunch. I made sure that he ordered what she always got. She threw it at him, said the only thing he got right was the soda. Very next time she and I went out, guess what she ordered?

So my meal today, before work (because yes, I went to work) was a petty as fuck tribute... I bought myself that same meal. And it was delicious. 

If she had wanted me to properly mourn as her daughter, she should have been a better mother. The ""cancer sucks"" and ""she was so wonderful and will be so missed"" messages are flowing on other's pages... not on mine though. I miss the possibility of a good mom, but I refuse to miss the one I had."
552,"My SO and I are both living at home with our parents and working full time. I’m an RN and he works a labor job making decent money. We met in high school and started dating a bit over 2 years ago. Our relationship is pretty great other than the fact that we are both living at home and not able to move out due to the ridiculously high costs of living in our city. We want to move out of our city, buy a home, and start an independent adult life. We pay rent to our parents but would much rather live together and pay a mortgage. We already have enough saved for a 60% down payment on a bungalow in the area we are planning to move. My parents and his dad love this idea and are excited for us to be able to start a life together. Future MIL on the other hand HATES this idea.  She tried to convince FDH that the area we are planning to move to is more expensive in terms of utilities and food which based on research and facts is not true. She thinks future DH should live with her until he has enough money to buy nearby (cheapest house is at least $500,000). She also had future DH convinced that he would never be able to afford to live on his own in our country. It wasn’t until I showed him housing prices outside of our city that he realized her lie.. 

The thing that really weirds me out about MIL though is the fact that she seems to get angry when FDH learns any sort of life skill. He started learning how to cook and she reacted terribly. She makes fun of his healthy meals and says that I am changing him. She won’t even allow him to do his own laundry. In fact, once when I accidentally bled on his bedsheets (IUD related) she wouldn’t stop questioning him and harassing him about why in the world he would be washing his own sheets. She also got really angry when he wouldn’t agree to fly to Disneyland with her (she basically only wanted him to go to help her pay for it). Someone please tell me if this abnormal or am I reading into it too much??

Side rant: It feels like she has never liked me because I turned my SO down for prom over 5 years ago. I didn’t know my SO that well at the time (we weren’t dating) and I had already agreed to go with my best friend who has since passed away. Whenever she mentions how awful I am for rejecting her son’s “promposal” it bothers me a lot. I feel I had the right to say no and I cherish my prom memories because my friend/date passed away two years later and it is one of our happiest memories together. It’s especially upsetting because JNMIL is aware that my prom date has since died and that it’s a touchy subject. She even said “You really want to live with her?! She didn’t even go to prom with you!”. Not sure why she always brings up prom 5 years later but it really hurts me. It also seems like she hates when I am complimented or treated well by my SO.  Ex: she said “she’s not that smart” when my SO complimented my nursing career and called me smart to his grandmother. It feels like constantly makes little remarks and jabs like this at me. 

Please let me know if I am overreacting. A lot of my friend irl who hear my stories of fMIL just think she is overprotective."
553,"So, as I've mentioned before, I'm not sure whether or not my SM is a JN or I've got a major case of BEC. I'm writing these stories in my down time at work, and hope that people get a kick out of their ridiculousness like I do now.

Stepmom is a sticky note FANATIC. She used the all the time to leave little passive aggressive messages all over the house. ""Remember to pick this up."" ""Remember to bring this home."" ""Remember to take your key."" ""Remember to put the toilet seat down.""

Sticky notes would pop up at us at random times, and they were always filled with ""helpful reminders"" to do basic things. Were we kids who didn't like to pick things up? Yeah. But was a sticky note in my lunchbox saying ""REMEMBER TO TAKE ME HOME"" going to remind my ADHD ass to take that thing anywhere after I stopped laughing at how strongly it was taped on? No.

But one day at the dinner table, Stepmom made an announcement. ""Brother. You need to remember to flush the toilet after you use it. I am tired of finding your *little poops* after you leave."" Okay. *Little poops*. Thanks. Of course, my brother denied vehemently that he ever doesn't flush the toilet. He was used to the accusations though, he was the Scapegoat. So, after laughing at her we just moved on.

Until I went to the bathroom. When I lifted the lid, there was a brand new sticky note replacing the ""Remember to close the lid"" note from before. This time the words were ""REMEMBER TO FLUSH THE TOILET."" I laughed after I remembered the conversation from before, and because of the irony of a reminder that no one will face when they finish making their *little poops*.

The sticky note remained there for weeks. Every once in a while we could hear Stepmom scream from the bathroom, ""FLUSH THE TOILET, BROTHER!!"" and his shouted response, ""I DID!""

Then, the day finally came. Stepmom had exited the bathroom just minutes before and returned to the living room. I decided that I had to go. I walk in. Lift the toilet seat. Bam. *Little fucking poops.*

Because I am a terminal asshole who is destined to have my intestines ripped out through my eyeballs for eternity by the Hamburgler in hell, I came down with a temporary case of amnesia. I leaned out the door. ""Brother? Were you the last one to use the toilet?"" ""No.""

""Hmm, who was the last one to use the toilet, then?""

&amp;#x200B;

Stepmom goes, ""I was! Why?!""

I say, ""did you not read the note? Please remember to flush the toilet after you go, no one wants to see your *little poops*.""

""What are you talking about? I DID flush!""

""Well that's not what the toilet is telling me. Do you want to see?""

&amp;#x200B;

The note was gone not 5 minutes later. It turned out to be a plumbing issue."
554,"Hi 

So have been together 3 years. His mother is well....his mother and a total pain. Now she sometimes comes to drive me over which I’m very appreciative of and always am grateful, nice and thank her profusely.

Now of course her being her, there’s always something. It always has to be on her terms. Always. She will request I am ready earlier which I do. Then it will be something else like we have to detour to drop off some rubbish or she’s really late coming for me as she’s been doing some crap and I’ve been waiting like an idiot as she said to be earlier. 

Last week it was that we had to detour to the pharmacy so I was sitting waiting a while in the car.

Honestly I just wait for what’s next. This week I’ve just been informed that she is at the hairdresser prior to picking me up much later than normal so unsure what time exactly . So again I’ll be waiting about for her. She has all the days of the week to do stuff and she always seems to choose the days I’m over there. Also I feel she will be awkward as I wasn’t over on my previous day as I had other plans but that’s not her business. 

Am I over reacting? This crap has been going on for ages and ages now. It always feels like it’s on her terms ? Like I know she’s driving the car but mostly I’m just waiting round for her or it’s all about her. Then sometimes even when we get to so house she comes in sometimes and hangs around for ages.

So fed up of this crap.  Just why do they do it? Just to be awkward? Passive aggressive? 
I’ve never known anyone like this. 

I feel like there’s nothing I can really do and just keep feeling powerless. If I say anything to so I feel like we can’t have that as it will upset her and fammmmmmmillly and we can’t have that. So I’m bottling this stuff up too much."
555,"Here's a bit of background:

My boyfriend (22) and I (23) lived with his mom and her fiancé up until two years ago. We were both working part-time in retail after college, so paid them £400 board per month between us, as demanded by them. We were struggling to save up for our own place whilst they were spending our board on holidays abroad and new clothes, phones, you name it.

Eventually, they told us we had a few months to move out, as they'd decided to 'move to a smaller house for just the two of them.' We did what they said, saved every penny we could for a deposit to rent somewhere, bought things to go in our future home and after a few months we moved to a one bedroom flat. 

I was angry that we were rushed into this, but also somewhat relieved to be away from them. They hadn't been the nicest to us when we lived with them, I'd found things out about her fiancé and exposed him. She was upset at first but once she'd forgiven him, she let him shit on us constantly! If I went into detail I'd be here forever. My boyfriend has been extremely disappointed by her choosing such a horrible person over her own son. Also, they didn't end up moving house at all, they were just lying and pushing us out so they could have his kids stay round in our former bedroom I believe.

Anyway, let's skip forward to the start of September this year. My boyfriend and I were just relaxing after work, in the same flat we moved to a couple of years ago, we have the same jobs too but with some more hours, so we've been pretty tight with money. He then received a message from his mother (who's barely bothered with us since we moved out), she said that she and her fiancé had split up. He'd given her until the end of the month to move out.

No other relatives offered her a place to stay, probably because she's a nightmare. She had no money due to health issues and just a part-time job. So, you can guess where she ended up! In our one bedroom flat, living on our pull out sofa.

At present day, she moved in 3 weeks ago. As soon as she moved in she started to rearrange my kitchen, this was the first morning she'd been here, whilst me and my boyfriend were still asleep. We've had to put things back the way we want them and tell her to stop. She's complained about our heating not being warm enough (she hadn't turned it up), her cat has been jumping all over my windowsills, I've had to move all my plants and decorations to prevent them from being damaged. 

I have a house rabbit, she's had to give up her freedom and stay in her cage most of the day so the cat can't get at her. The cat's jumped on her cage (a few days ago) and it collapsed, my poor bunny was almost squashed! All MIL did was say ""maybe you should get a sturdier cage.""

She's extremely clingy towards my boyfriend now, after not giving a shit about him. It's only because she has no one else, she only does things which help herself.

I'm sick of changing my lifestyle, giving up my living room, my rabbit's freedom, my privacy, having to tiptoe around at night because she's a light sleeper. I've told her time and time again about locking her cat in the bathroom when she leaves the house and she still doesn't. I'm fed up of her acting like my flat is now hers, at the end of the day she's homeless and we're just helping her get back on her feet!

She's been trying to push us into us all moving into a bigger house to share, we told her no, we need our own space and she had a breakdown and claimed she was going to kill herself because she didn't want to live alone. I'm at a loss, she's depressed about losing her fiancé and home, but we can't ignore how disrespectful and rude she's been since she moved in. We've been pushing her to get help from the local council. I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping she hurries up and moves out asap! 

Will post updates, I am either going to lose my mind or she is going to move out. My partner feels exactly the same as me.

Tl;dr
MIL moved in 3 weeks ago after relationship breakdown, keeps changing things around after we've told her not to, her cat is an asshole and we're losing our minds."
556,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeautic at this point in time. 

TPP is a narcissist to the 19th degree. She was somewhat good at hiding her evilness behind closed doors until I refused to let her behind closed doors anymore and began NC. Then, she began a campaign of trying to get me to get over myself. Except, TPP is a narcissist and doesn't understand how to apologize. So, TPP had to turn to Google (gogle?) to figure out how to get me back under her wing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this wasn't coming from TPP because it was too grammatically correct. I took to Google myself and found the original post, it was a letter from a dad to his daughter. She'd copied bits and pieces here and there to form her own ""letter"". 

&amp;#x200B;

*""1) You can't change people. Not men, not your friends, not your mother or your father. Accept the ones you want to accept, move on from the ones you don't (except your mother or your father, of course). You won't look back, I promise.*

*2)There will be times when you think you hate me, when you are angry with me and there will be times when I am angry with you. That's ok. Be angry, but be honest with yourself and know that even when I am angry with you, I still love you. The love I have for you can never be broken or taken away from you. It is a constant you can always count on.*

*3) Please know that I am not perfect, no one is and I will make mistakes, too. I promise to always do my best to recognize those mistakes and work on myself. You are my teacher and I am yours.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I love you and miss you no matter how you feel about me you are still my blood, my daughter.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I was instructed to send 1 reply (per my lawyer) that said I did not want contact in any shape or form, any further contact would be harassment. Then I blocked. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, brand new email account. 

*""I am begging you for forgiveness. I love you, I need you, I miss you. We can meet at a park. Please, OP, I miss you, my priss pod. You was always my everything. Don't come here, it's not safe around here anymore anyway. But I miss my friend, my daughter. I miss our talks. If you don't want to see me will you let me see DD for a few hours? take her to a park, to eat (not my house) but just me and her?  Unless you wanna come. Or I will spend 10 minutes there swinging her and not bother you and you can get some things done around your house. Please Op I've never pleaded b4. You have always been my world. Now my world has stopped and I have no idea why. I need you! more than you know!""* 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, a letter with no return address. 

&amp;#x200B;

Word for word, from a ""how to get your angries out healthily"" webpage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""I can't tell you enough or in the right words how sorry I am for the things that I've done.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't blame you for being mad at me, but please forgive me. I don't want that to happen again and it's not going to. I'm very ashamed and humiliated.* 

*I am sorry for all the times I made you feel bad and I wish I could take them all back.* 

*I am sorry for all the things I've done to you. I have been a very angry person. All this time I thought I was doing the right thing, but I wasn't. I was hurting you and did not see it. I pray that someday you will learn to forgive me, and love me once more. All I want is for our family to be happy, and I will do whatever needs to be done to assure that.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I love you, and I for us to get back the trust and love we once had. Please never forget that I love you more than anything, and you mean the world to me.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Love, Mom"".* 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, that hurt worse than the insincere non apologies. To know that my mother doesn't give a shit about me enough to even come up with her own apologies, or her own words, and has to COPY AND PASTE from INTERNET sites to try and get me to do what she wants me to do HURT. I wasn't even worth reading a book, I was a googled apology site and a viral book of faces post."
557,"So I don't have many stories of my JNGM but I have a few and I can always get a couple off my mom. 

So let's rewind to the early 80s when my mother and father are anxiously awaiting the birth of their first child (3 guesses who it is and the first 2 don't count). Well, eventually I make my grand appearance in the world, and these are the days before ""rooming in"" so I'm taken to the nursery with the large observation window so family and friends can see the newest member of the world. 

Something you should know about my grandmother: she always wanted a girl but instead she had three sons. In fact, I was the first girl born with my surname in 60 something years (the last was my grandfather's older sister. One sister never married or had children and the other only had one son). 

So she's standing with my grandfather with CBF complaining about my birth when she turns to my grandfather and says ""why is everyone so excited, she's not that cute of baby. Nothing really special at all.""

What JNGM didn't realize was that JYGM was standing behind her and had heard everything. (I don't remember this grandmother but from what I have been told she pulled no punches). The exact exchange has been lost to time but my JYGM laid into JN so bad that she blanched white, turned tail and walked out. It took that chick six months before she ever saw me again solely because she was jealous that my mom had a girl and she didnt."
558,"Hey gang. Normally I'm here about my MIL, but today I'm seeking any and all advice in regards to DH's grandma. Who herself is a hardcore JN, but has now been officially diagnosed with dementia. 

I'm having an incredibly hard time keeping my patience around her. Her less likeable qualities are becoming louder because of her disease. I always bite my tongue and am respectful towards her. Since her diagnosis she has been a monster to me. I'll post the actual meltdown event later, but for now only advice and honesty is needed.

So good people of JNMIL, any good reading material, advice, deep breathing exercises I can do so I dont lose it on this senile ol' bitty?

ETA: I have lost a family member from Alzheimers and can understand how it deteriorates people as time goes on and basically turns them into aged infants. But the family member I lost was one I cared for deeply and I'm looking to navigate how to handle this disease in someone I do not care for. Simply not being around her at all isn't an option."
559," So the boyfriend and I were talking about our relationship and communication and we ended up using his mom as an example.  His mom is very critical of me. We are not really talking to his family right now because he and I have tried to make peace with them and has mom does not change her ways. I asked him what he would like to see different between his mom and I. He said that he wants me to be more forgiving and accepting and light hearted with his mom. I asked him if that meant that if she continued to criticize me if I am just supposed to accept it and forgive her. He pretty much said yes. He said I should not read into it as criticism and just look at it as something else. If you need an example, if I drink a diet pop or have fried food around her she will say that she doesn't know how people can eat like that and that is disgusting. I also asked him if she continued that stuff that he would call her out on it eventually. He said that at sounds like I don't trust him to believe that he would.

 Last Thanksgiving they invited us and my kids over. I told him that the kids and I we're not going to go, and he told me to text her that . I did and he ended up stopping over the day after Thanksgiving and she told him how rude it was that I did not tell her if he was going to be there or not. He did not defend me and tell her that he instructed me on want to say. I reminded him that I do trust him, and that I also want him to speak up for me if she is putting me down when I am not around. I guess what I am somewhat looking for is to know if anybody has been in a similar situation and learned to just grow really thick skin to deal with people that are not kind to you without being unkind back to them. I know that some of you may respond with telling me that I need to leave this relationship already, and I believe in free speech so you can tell me that if that is what you feel, but I am wondering how to work through this because I am scared of this relationship failing. Any other advice or insight is welcome as well."
560,"The flair says ‘advice wanted’, but it’s really not. You can give it if you want though. There’s just no ‘live, trigger warning’ anymore. 

Tonight I got a call from my JYDad letting me know he and Lady M were at the vets and the family dog was so unwell they had to put him down. 

As soon as he said that I started crying. The dog had been sick for a while and we’ve had some scares before, so it must’ve been pretty bad for it to be the actual end for the little dog. The decision wouldn’t have been made lightly. 

Unfortunately I’m at work (night shift) and couldn’t really talk. A coworker found me crying and gave me a much-needed cuddle and FDH visited later as well for a better cuddle. 

I called JYDad back later when I’d calmed down a bit and B1 picked up. He told me they’d already buried him and I just started crying again. I thanked him and asked if everyone was okay. We all seem to be as okay as we’ll ever be about the dog dying. 

I messaged Lady M later to comfort her because I know she’ll take it the hardest. It was good. We had a small joke between us about the dog hanging out with a cat we used to have (they were... friendly). I asked if FDH and I could come over tomorrow (Wednesday) either morning (after work for me) or evening (just before work). Evening works. 

I don’t know how I’ll do because work is because extra-stupid and I’m worried I’ll take my stress out on family with emotions running high. I won’t mean to do it. I feel I’ll probably make a stupid comment but... I’ll update if needed."
561,"As per my previous posts, MIL has always been toxic and manipulative, and my fiancé is very recently coming to see it. 

When D (stepdaughter age 3.5) was a baby, MIL was the primary care giver while fiancé and his now ex wife worked. It turned into her acting like this baby was HER baby. She even calls herself “momma” and then catches herself and says “grandma.” She actively hates me, and encourages D to treat me badly (even forces her to call me by my first name instead of Momma—I’m momma, her mom is mommy). We’ve gone no contact several times and we were on the verge of a final straw cut off when his dad was in a terrible accident at the beginning of August and nearly died. He’s still in the hospital and will be for the foreseeable future. 

D has some major behavioral problems that have come to a head in the last two weeks. She’s always been violent when she doesn’t get her way and we’ve been fighting with her mom to get her seen by a behavior therapist. Last Thursday, it came to a head when I was trying to give her and my own 4yo a bath and D lashed out and clawed her nails across my face and injured my eye. That was the last straw and even her mom agreed it’s time for a professional to get involved. Today was that appointment. 

MIL is furious that we would dare say that D has any behavior issues and that she’s just “a precious perfect angel baby and doesn’t do bad things, LuminousNoxious is just awful and mean and I should just raise her if you think she’s so bad.” 

She just made a post on her FB saying that she got to spend the whole weekend with D. Excuse me? We got ahold of D’s mom and sure enough, she was with MIL the entire weekend that D was SUPPOSED to be with her mom. In this post, she states that they had a great weekend together and that “she was so good. No she is not perfect she is 3yr old but she was good. We went out for supper with family, saw papa and great grandma, and on Sunday went to church. I love spending time with her, sometimes no most the time I never want to give her back. I already miss her.” 

Fiancé is livid. He was IN with the therapist when I saw this post and immediately sent it to him to show the therapist what we’re dealing with. This woman literally thinks SHE should raise this child and let her do whatever she wants and act however she wants vs. getting help and finding how we can best address this violence and rage. 

I’m shaking with pure rage right now. Fiancé is on the GD warpath.

Edit: y’all, we cannot afford a lawyer, we don’t qualify for legal aid. If we could we would. Those questions aren’t necessarily helpful."
562,"I got a name for MIL.
Spongebob squarepants. She vaguely resembles him and I wish she would move far away to a pineapple under the sea.
—————-
Flaired this as ambivalent because I recognize that this is also an SO problem. If anyone has successfully helped their SO grow a damn spine I’d love to know how you did it.
————-

“He’s going to abuse women!” 
Spongebob said this about my almost 1 y/o DS. Why??? Because he was a little cranky, as babies are sometimes, and she was trying to force affection and smiles out of him. He was tired and not having it, trying to push her away. That’s when she dropped this gem and said, “He’s going to abuse women!”
“DON’T SAY THAT!” I scolded her immediately.
“Oh sometimes I just say things...” she tried to backpedal.
And DH???
Just bit his tongue as he usually does when Spongebob says something ridiculous and offensive.

Earlier in the same visit, in another moment when DS was being cranky (quick note- he wasn’t cranky the whole visit and he wasn’t cranky with everyone who engaged him, mostly her as she kept trying to get all up in his face instead of giving him space and letting him warm up to her), Spongebob says, “That’s because OP doesn’t let him be around anyone!”
Spongebob says this, as she’s holding my DS in her living room, which is a 3 hour round trip for us. We were just there less than a month and a half ago on another visit.
“I’m his mother, who else is he going to be around more than me?!” I snapped back at her.
She didn’t say anything after that.
And DH? Useless DH.... didn’t say shit then, either.
It’s so frustrating that he always freezes in the moment when Spongebob is being rude and disrespectful. I am able to stick up for myself and respond and I’ll continue doing that when necessary.
In general he’s a good partner and father. But his inability as a grown man to shut down his mother’s BS and stick up for me is so unattractive. It repulses me that he seems defenseless when it comes to her.
When we left her house it was late and I was tired. We all went to sleep when we got home and there wasn’t time to process everything.
The next day was very busy with chores around the home and by the end of it I was too tired for processing...
But the morning after that I had quiet time to reflect on what she said and his lack of response. I was still upset and irritated with him and he noticed. So I had to explain why I was upset with what she said and his silence.
He tried to deflect and blame me.
“So you’re just going to lord this over me the whole year?”
He actually said that shit.
“Oh no, I’ll just keep my mouth shut and never bring up anything when your mother does something that upsets me. I’ll just swallow it all down and put a happy smile on my face like a good little housewife,” I said.
And walked away from him.
He comes to me shortly after and says that’s not what he wants. That his mother’s comments bothered him too and he’s going to say something to her. That he knows he has a problem confronting her about things and he needs to get over it.
“Yeah, you do. You’re a grown ass man,” i said to him.
.....
I don’t know if he’s said anything to her yet. To be honest, I doubt it. I feel like he just said he would to appease me.

Well the holidays are coming up. I already was planning on spending Thanksgiving with my side (we were with his family last year for Thanksgiving). Spongebob’s stupidity only solidified my choice.
As for Christmas, I will spend that in my home with DS.
If Spongebob starts her shit about the holidays and harassing me over not going to her (what prompted a period of NC between us a few years ago) I have no problems going NC again.
Don’t try me bitch."
563,"This happened yesterday at MILs thanksgiving dinner (Canada).

Mid dinner while everyone is socializing. SIL who is currently pregnant with her second child was discussing baby names with a family sitting in kitchen including MIL, myself and a few others.

I’m not sure how the conversation started but she stated how she whenever she goes shopping even if it’s a quick trip for one thing she comes out with 3 toys for her son. 

“Honestly, it’s a successful trip if he only cries. He throws such a tantrum he throws stuff off the shelf screaming throwing himself on the ground”

Me - “you know he does that because he knows you’ll buy him stuff?”

SIL - “I just think it’s because he’s a boy”

JYUIL - “No I have 4 boys. You should figure that out right away it will be really hard with the next baby. ”

SIL -“well it’s my moms fault I tell her no and she goes ‘it’s okay Grammy buy it for you’ and buys him whatever he grabs. Even if I say no he doesn’t need that she does it anyways”

MIL - laughs out loud 

JYUIL - “you don’t think I went threw that? Our mother was the same way.”

MIL - “yeah we would be coming over for dinner or a visit with you when you and your siblings were kids and she would give you guys ice cream at 10 in the morning even if I said no” (then laughs again)

SIL - “I bring him over at 10 in the morning to visit you and you give him chocolate bars”

MIL - “well he has been up for hours and not eaten breakfast yet he has to eat SOMETHING”

....


Now you’re probably wondering why the hell I didn’t speak up. After my first comment I grabbed the baby and went into the other room while eaves dropping on the conversation. The look on MILs face when I made my comment was like she took a bite of a lemon instead of the turkey on her plate while also lowering her head because she knows she does that - then admitted it. 

I wanted to say if anyone pulled that shit with my kids we would put a load of distance between them and the kids and state how disrespectful it is to blatantly disregard parents parenting but it would have been obviously directed at her. Honestly, the way she raises her kids and her relationship with her mother isn’t my business. If she ever asked for my advice I would give it in a gentle way. We were raised differently and therefore raise our kids differently. I may not agree with things they do but that’s why I keep them at a distance and don’t leave them alone with my kids.

I can guarantee you this shit don’t fly with me anymore and she listens when I say no. What a bitch though."
564,"This happened 4 years ago but the pain gets brought back up twice a year, this week is one of those.  

Back story, weather important or not is up to you. My grandma was my best friend. I can't even begin to describe how caring and sweet she was, or the things she helped me get through. In late 2014 Drs told her that her cancer had returned, no surgical or treatment options this time. At the time only her youngest son knew as he drove her to the appointments. 2 weeks later she found him dead from an intentional OD. She decided to keep it secret a little longer so she didn't hurt anyone else. 

The family (myself included) found on in early 2015. My mom told me that she had a few months left (found out later she lied to me too, she only had weeks). I started making plans to fly me and my 16 month old to see her. Flight was cancelled after I was at the airport. Booked the next one I could get, 2 weeks away. The night before my flight I called my grandma. She made me promise her many things, in that was to not waste money flying there if she was already gone. 

Next day I was packing, happy to make it there to see her, I was only 12 hours away from that. My mom didn't call me, but my husband and broke the news to him. He came home with the news, my world fell apart around me. He cancelled the flight for me at my request. My mom started calling me, shaming me for not being there in time, for not still coming. I said I'd come for the funeral but not with my child, I just couldn't handle flying with her in my state. She never informed me that she already planned a small wake, just posted pictures with all my smiling extended family one day. I let it go, now is not the time to fight wth family. A week later my mom tells me when they get back home they want to have another for the family that couldn't fly down and she'd let me know when. Seems nice right?

Grandma passed in May, she held off until October. When she told me the date she picked I was in disbelief. She planned it for my birthday. As she told me the date I said, ""well happy birthday to me I guess"". My moms response  was to tell me ""oh I guess that is your birthday, I forgot"".

With my birthday coming up in a few days the pain and anger is all coming back. I keep asking myself, why. Why would she use her moms death to hurt me like this?"
565,"It was Thanksgiving in Canada this last weekend and my mother loves to do what I call her “rounds”. She calls all family members she can think of to wish them a happy whatever holiday it is. I go out of my way to call her on Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Mother’s Day, and her birthday. Other than that, the holiday doesn’t really matter but I’ll typically get a phone call from her, especially if she’s been into the booze.

So, Sunday was no exception. I’m in the middle of moving, stress with MIL is beyond, and I don’t have much time to talk to her. Further, if it’s the weekend and if mom is calling, I’m willing to bet she’s been into the sauce. But I answered anyway.

She says she is calling to wish me a happy thanksgiving and asks what I’m thankful for. I just bought a house, what the hell type of question is that. So I blow her off and say haven’t really thought about it today. She says she is thankful for whatever she gets and (this is where is starts to get weird), if she “tries and does something would that be okay”? I said what? Because it didn’t make any sense. Then she starts going on about how my grandmother today told her she wasn’t making any sense and how Oma didn’t want to talk about it. I asked my mom to explain and she said Oma doesn’t want to talk to me. I wasn’t into arguing so I just said well maybe she’s having a hard day. I know Oma doesn’t want to talk to her because she’s drunk and it’s hard to understand her when she’s drunk.

She asks questions about my condo, like is there a bedroom for me to stay in. I said well not right away because I’m moving. And she said well I can always sleep on the couch if I’m welcome. I replied that I’ve never said you’re not welcome. She replied well no, your my daughter! It’s just overly sappy the way she says it, it makes me want to hang up the phone.

Next is conversation about how she wants to bring me a spider plant. I’m terrible at planting. The only plants I have that live are cactus and I’m moving into a place that’s a third of the size of what I currently live in. I don’t want or need anything. I explained that to her. She replies with well I live in a small place too! It’s not even my place, you can always hang up the plants. I replied, I don’t want anything. And she said I live in a small condo too! I have no space either. I said I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me right now! So, of course she changes the subject to how she needs to figure out something and she isn’t sure what she is going to do. Her vagueness again makes no sense.

I asked if she has people coming over for dinner and she starts getting weepy and how no one is coming over and basically how no one wants to visit but they are always welcome and how I don’t come to visit ever. And my favorite part of the conversation: “mom, I don’t feel comfortable staying in a house with a strange person I don’t know, so even if I came it wouldn’t be for the night”. She said “yes you do have that anxiety. I don’t know where that came from.”

I mean, the anxiety couldn’t be from the fact that my parents constantly fought, that I had little to no support as a kid, that I was left alone while my parents went to the bar, that both my parents are alcoholics, that my mother was abusive in her punishments (favorite one is on your knees in the corner on linoleum, more you cried the longer you stayed). But we don’t know where that came from. Even better is my anxiety has so little to do with staying the night at her place that it’s irrelevant.

She must have known she went to far because I was about to say that I should go when she cut me off and said that she would let me go and to just think about what I would be thankful for today. I just said okay I should go. Of course she drags the conversation on for another few minutes but I’m getting better at getting off the phone. Still not great but I’ll get there.

Why can’t I just have a normal mother in my life. Why do both my mother and my MIL have to be looneys?!"
566,"So. I don't know why or how to stop this. I have been doing really good about saying ""No"" as a whole sentence. But then I immediately feel guilty and start texting my mom lovebomb things and memes. It's like I'm trying to not make her mad. 

I don't know how to stop. Yesterday I got really mad because I got a message from someone on my facespace asking who I was. Upon further investigation I discovered I'd sent him a friend request. Only thing is...I don't use that profile. My mom did it on accident while she was snooping on my dead cousin's page. So yeah. She friend requested my dead cousin's co-worker. 

I got mad at in group text with my sister (for evidence) I said if it happens again I will shut down everything. I then ran through my friends list and nuked anyone who wasn't family. (My mom said don't remove so and so) I just ignored that. So after I scolded my mom. I immediately lovebombed. Why the hell am I doing this?"
567,"I stopped speaking to MIL Barone after she fed my 9 month old a McDonald's Cheeseburger (see previous posts). She sent a message just saying ""sorry"" about a week before his first birthday (July) and I accepted it and said ""let's all move on from it now"" for the sake of DH. She spent the week before his party sending me the same messages over and over which I thought okay she must have dementia or something now. Turns out she was deleting my replies on her phone and sending the screen shots to DH saying I'm ignoring her. I showed him my phone with replies (like what did she think was going to happen?). 

Now before the party I pumped for a bottle so I wouldn't have to take DS away for feeds, and he cried when she picked him up because he didn't remember her. She yelled out in front of EVERYONE including my extremely religious grandmother, all my uncles, etc ""DS WANTS TITTY TITTY BOOM BOOM"" fucking cringe. She does this thing where she announces very loudly when DS needs something to make me sound like a bad mum. Like yelling out ""HE SMELLS LIKE WEE, HE REALLY NEEDS A NAPPY CHANGE"" even when I literally change it on purpose just before we see her so she DOESN'T do this.

Anyway we have seen her maybe 3 times since then (July). I, ME, literally organised like 10 times to see her and SHE DIDN'T SHOW. Then she tells everyone how much she ""misses"" DS as if I don't let her see him! She even said it to one of my friends at a party they both happened to be at. I sent her a message saying ""why are you telling people you miss DS, you can see him anytime you want?"" and she said ""I do miss DS I said for your friend to tell him I love and miss him. I don't think that's wrong."" which I just ignored.

Last week stopped by her cafe, she made like 20 Marie Barone digs like ""thats a nice jumpsuit did you get that from Kmart it's very affordable there"" and ""you're not wearing a bra, how brave"" etc in front of all her staff. So I had my dose of Marie for a while, I won't be making any more efforts to visit her.

But what I would like is any Marie Barone digs I can give back next time I do see her. She always makes me feel stupid and does it in front of everyone and I'm not good with backhanded compliments but I'd like to give some back. Especially coming up to Christmas ;)"
568,"Update: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/di5rfk/update\_mil\_sneaking\_in\_our\_house\_and\_trying\_to/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/di5rfk/update_mil_sneaking_in_our_house_and_trying_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Hello,

So I will try to make this short if possible, Im a bit confused as to how I should continue this relationship.

First of all, Im male. My wife is 50:50 split between having her head deep in her mothers butt and not wanting to have anything to do with her - It’s complicated.

My relationship to MIL was always awkward, she didn’t want her precious daughter to leave home and build up her own family so she always tried to shackle my wife as near to her as possible and used every possible trick up her sleeve to achieve exactly that. From fake illness to emotional stirrups to last second unnoticed vacations we HAAAAAD to come with and my wife not once, until now, grasped that what her mother was doing, was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

So, around 6 months ago, MIL and FIL bought a new house - smaller one, as they didn’t need all that space at their old home, at first I personally wasn’t interested in that house, but somehow my MIL convinced my wife to convince me to “buy” the house from them, so we can buy cheap and live with one less worry. I was completely against the purchase of that house. It was incredibly near to the new home ( 30min walking distance ) and the amount they asked for ( 450K ) was not justified for the state the house was in. Long story short, my wife got extremely upset with me not wanting the house and I just gave up and said yes. So yay - we own a house now.

For info. We got the keys, Documents, everything is on paper. Nothing is in their name anymore, It’s all on us now.

And for the past few months of us moving in, renovating a bit here and there all seemed well. They never came to visit, we always visited them and the house was fine after some work ( still a lot to fix ).

BUT I noticed a few things, whenever we are gone for more than 8+ hours or a few days and then return to the house, it seems like someone was inside. I could have sworn some of my stuff was moved, a few times it smelled like “gas” as if I left something on the kitchen running and the sink in one of the bathrooms was wet, even so I always wipe it dry after using.

Even my wife found it odd and after the gas incident she was alarmed. So I figured, MIL has probably a key still in her possession that we don’t know of and she snoops around. I bought 2 cheap cameras and installed them so I could see the entrance and the living room as those 2 are connected + as someone suggested on here, I changed out the locks by buying completely new secure doors and having them changed out as well as new window security as all of those were old.

2 days after everything was changed I got a text from MIL saying that Im a evil person trying to destroy everything she loves (??) and that she wants the house back from us, as she isn‘t tolerating how we are treating her old property. I asked her where this came from all of a sudden and her answer was „You‘re destroying our old home, the door was a precious memento and we shouldn‘t have changed it out without asking her first“.

I told her that house was no longer hers and we could do whatever we wanted. Didn‘t hear back from her until now. She now wants her house back because we‘re apparently not fit to be home owners, she is giving us back 430K of the 450K as they already spent 20K and want everything back. I told her to go eat grass and that the home is now ours.

I already had the police at my door. Can you imagine what it looked liked for me to explain to them, that this house was legally mine? They fucking laughed.

&amp;#x200B;

And the worst? My wife says to just get the old door back in. I don‘t get my MIL, that Im okay with. But I don‘t get how my wife can be SO deep up her bullshit.

If it were for me, I would go no contact and leave it at that but my wife is just...glued to her. I can‘t even enjoy „marriage“ anymore, it doesn‘t feel like her and I, it feels like her, I and her batshit mother.

FIL is alright. Just a normal person, most of the time fed up with MILs bullshit too, but he can‘t be bothered to actually hold her back.

Im stressed, angry and really disappointed.

Advice please?"
569,"It was Canadian thanksgiving this weekend. Bf did not go up to see his dad. We had plans with people that wanted both of us to be with them as a couple. 

Saturday night we had just crawled into bed when bfs phone began to ring. It was conniption Connie. She started off by guilting him that he never goes to see his dad. Then she said his dad will be having surgery in early December and he’s worried about it and that he really misses his 2 kids (hasn’t talked to his daughter in over 5 years also because of conniption Connie)

Bf went on to explain to her that it’s very hard to plan to go up there and see them when I am not welcome. She continued to call me an ignorant bitch and say I’d never apologized to her daughter. (I did I have the messages still)

The conversation continued and she called me an ignorant bitch about 5 more times. She told him he needs to think about what he really wants.. he told her “I’m not leaving leicams so you’ll have to fucking get used to that!” 

After figuring out she was getting nowhere she told him that if he wants to bring me he can, they’ll behave but he really needs to spend time with his father because life is too short to hold grudges. 

WOMAN YOU STILL CALL ME AN IGNORANT BITCH 3.5 YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL FIGHT!!! Stop making shit awkward because right now me going up there is the only way he will... your plan to see him hinges on me also going up there. 

I have no words. Just felt like sharing.. should I go up and try for him while also putting myself in a potential triggering situation so their true colours show again or should I just leave it how it’s been?"
570,"Last year for our DD's first birthday we threw a party with both sides of the family and DD's friends. It was a nice laid back celebration at my Dad's house where we all had a BBQ lunch, sat around talking in the sun, and watching DD and her wee friends play. Everyone was talking about how nice a party it was...

Everyone except MIL.

The entire time she made snarky comments about how it was expensive (it wasn't), how DD won't even remember it (who cares), even comments about how the colour of Dad's brand new deck was too dark (it wasn't). She got DD a horrible talking teddy bear as a present that all the toddlers were terrified of. When no one wanted to play with her toy she sulked for the rest of the party. 

She came over to visit last week and she asked about DD's 2nd birthday in a few weeks. I started saying that we would probably just have a quiet family dinner because we are moving house the week before but before I could finish my sentence she was saying things like ""phew, I thought you were going to have a huge party every year!"" and ""DD won't remember it anyway"". The real kicker came when she said ""you should only have parties for the important birthdays anyway. 1st, 5th and 10th. Every year is ridiculous!"". I told DH when he got home from work and he confirmed he only ever had three parties, hence why he is so keen for our kids to have one every year. 

We have changed our minds and decided that we still want to do a wee party for DD just after we move, but since MIL doesn't believe in 2nd birthday parties, she doesn't need to be invited! She'll sulk for weeks if she finds out but oh well.

I don't really need advice but comebacks to any snarky comments about birthday parties will be well recieved!"
571,"So my MIL has always gotten on my nerves from day one. She has issues with boundaries, says some very disrespectful things, and doesn’t really think her actions through. Despite all those things I’m generally courteous to her and let things slide, but this is the one thing I am putting my foot down on. 

Here is my issue, my husband and I now have a LO. MIL is already talking about taking LO to stay with her over the summer once LO is a little older. She lives a state over. I absolutely will not let this happen. My DH does not understand why I’m so against it, but to me it seems pretty clear. I’ll explain my reasoning to you guys and you can tell me if I’m overreacting. 

MIL is very spacey. She constantly forgets what she was saying and where she left things. One time she called me three days in a row asking me the same question because she just couldn’t remember if she had already asked. I thought she was joking, but she honestly couldn’t remember talking to me the day before. She even admits that her memory is terrible. What’s gonna happen if she has LO? Is she going to forget LO at the supermarket or something? Or forget to feed her???

She owns a gun which wouldn’t be a problem except that I don’t feel like she is a responsible gun owner especially if there is a child in her care. She doesn’t own a gun safe in her home. She drives around with the gun just in her trunk or center console. Hey it’s her gun she can do what she wants with it, but I do not want my LO to have access to it. 

She makes careless decisions. She has taken her other grandchild (my BIL’s LO) to stay with her before and on multiple occasions the child has gotten hurt because of MIL’s careless choices. That alone should be enough reason.  She also left the child with people that the parents do not know, like neighbors and friends. Who does that?!?! Who takes someone’s child and just leaves them with other people???I think that is a huge deal. She may trust these people, but the parents do not and that to me is unacceptable. 

She has terrible vision, but insists on driving everywhere. One time she told me that she couldn’t really see the road in front of her. Why would you still be driving if you can’t see? Is she going to drive my LO around not being able to see the road? 

Those are just a few of my biggest concerns (there is more, trust me). I feel like I’m justified in saying that my LO will not be staying with her without us there. My DH thinks it is because I don’t like his mom, but I honestly think the reasons I listed above are legitimate reasons not to let her take LO. I’m concerned for LO’s safety. I’m not saying she can’t have contact with her grandchild. I just don’t want her to take LO on her own. What do you guys think? Am I overreacting?


Edit: thank you everyone to commented!! I assure you I am reading them all. It’s just hard to reply with a LO running around. I have asked her to get herself checked out, but she is extremely stubborn and gets defensive. She is determined that she is only forgetting things because her memory is bad and nothing else. I’ve had DH talk to her about it too, but to no avail."
572,"Currently, my husband and I are childless, we lost a pregnancy this summer (of course MIL had to make it about her when we told her), but we're hoping to start trying again early next year. My in-laws moved several states away, thankfully, so we only have to see them once or twice a year.   
This weekend my husband and I went to brunch with my BIL and his wife. We had a great time together, and the conversation was light-hearted about times we weren't that nice to our siblings. The conversation shifted when my BIL started talking about a time when their mother continually slapped him across the face over and over. I sat stunned. My husband has told me in the past about how strict his parents were growing up. He had mentioned how scary his mother could be when she was angry. However, this is a level of abuse I never expected. I knew she could be manipulative and straight-up vindictive when she wanted to be, but I never thought physically abusive.   
If my husband and I have children, I will never let them stay over for a time with their grandparents, and I'll never take them out of my sight. One grandkid, she dotes on but the others she ignores (because it's our fault she moved away, her husband relocated for work) so maybe my kids will be lucky, and she won't want to have anything to do with them.   
I could only be so lucky."
573,"Hey guys! I’m new to Reddit, and almost immediately discovered Justnomil, and it had been a blessing to read these stories and find that I’m not the only one!! MIL has passed, bless her, but the bane of my life is actually my Mum. Controlling, coersive, has to be right... you know the drill... but NOTHING like some of the horrors I’ve read about. 
I just thought I’d post to ask what you guys would recommend as a good response to the “I’ve called you but there was no answer” mini guilt trip. She’s suggesting I’ve ignored her on purpose and I’m getting sick of the “I haven’t had any missed calls”, “Well, I called you” “but I haven’t had any missed calls” conversation... 
I’ve just had “Well, I called you and Grandaughter1 and Grandaughter2 and nobody answered!” 
Oh how I’d love to respond with “yep told ‘em to ignore you too” :))  
All suggested responses welcome!!"
574,"Well, my DH has decided that it will be his mission to return the favor from here on out and find weird and ultimately useless items to gift her in return. Any suggestions are welcome, especially with Christmas just around the corner ;)

So for those that don’t know, my MIL is the one who ‘forgot’ DH birthday and chose to go on a cruise, but also wanted to FaceTime during the party so she wouldn’t miss out. Both our phones were off. 

Well this is sort of a follow up from that. It had been a while since FF had arrived back home and we agreed to see her for lunch as she had mentioned a few times she wanted to give DH his birthday present. 

Let me preface this by saying I really enjoy giving gifts, for me the thought is the most important part. I like to put a lot of effort into what I give. I brought/made 30 gifts for my DH 30th, it was wayyy over the top and some of it was just silly (I made a custom Pokémon card, cause why not!), but the look on his face made it worth it. 

FF on the other hand, not only some how manages to find and gift the most bizarre things, she also purchases herself extremely expensive things as sort of a ‘gift’ to herself, usually on or around other people’s birthdays. For example FF gave her oldest sons, an adult man, for his birthday, a toy similar to diablo sticks… and was really upset when he handed it off to his kid, FF said she wouldn’t buy him gifts in the future. 

Another more bazaar one was when she brought her grandson an electric toothbrush for his 21st birthday and brought herself a 3D printer. I won’t lie, it left a sour taste in my mouth. 

So my DH and I had bets on what his present would be, he thought possibly some wine or something from the arrival lounge in the airport, because why get something from an exotic location? And I thought it would be mug. But those things were far to practical a gift it turns out! 

My DH, a 30yr old man, got a 23inch candle holder. Yes, you read right, a candle holder of a castle they didn’t even visit, but not only that, FF also brought a smaller one for herself so they could be twins.

Well, my DH has decided that it will be his mission to return the favour from here on out and find weird and ultimately useless items to gift her in return. Any suggestions are welcome, especially with Christmas just around the corner ;)

A bonus highlight from the visit was that FF practically begging us to go on a cruise with her, this involved the typical JN high pitch whine and CBF when we said No! 

I would rather eat my own sock 👌🏼"
575,"DH has addressed how he felt about justnomil to sil. Told her that until she apologises and changes, he will remain NC. He told sil that gifts won't fix things and won't be accepted. Sil has turned this entire thing on DH. She turned into a huge enabling flying monkey. Told DH that HE needs to reach out, that his mother has tried to fix this, that SHE(sil) just wants her family back together, that SHE(sil) thinks all this isn't worth breaking up the family. Justnomil has lied to sil about trying to reach out and sil doesn't know who to trust (eye roll entered here) what a flipping mess of a family. I'm so tired."
576,"
So, I’m asking for help right here, ‘cause I’ve been having some trouble with my parents this few last years and right now it got worse. 

Sorry if this gets long, but I rather prefer to clarify some things at first than making people confused in maybe some little details. I’m kind of desperate. 

I (M18) have been in a relationship with my GF (F18) for nearly 5 years (yes, since we were 13 y/o) and we consider our relationship a serious and “formal” one, loving each other and all that stuff. Obviously we’re not the “all great &amp; no problems” kind of relationship, we have had our arguments and stuff, if it serves for something clearing that out. 

The problem is  that we both come from damaged families. She’s comes from one where the mother is an alcoholic woman that abuses her physically and manipulates everyone around making people think that my gf is the bad one in the story (even made my mom think that) and her father obviously is not always for her because of work. On the other hand, I’ve been living with my mother mainly (who has manipulated me emotionally) and without a father figure because my father does not take responsibility for his children and acts like a friend of us with us, like not showing and being a father figure. 

This both things have made trouble between our families and we have almost break up some times in the past, but we don’t want to separate because we really love each other. Her parents some time ago thought that I was a bad influence for her daughter and my parents think the same about her (that she’s a bad influence for me). It affected in my relationship with my mother because I lost her trust and she lost mine, mainly because she has done so much things to separate me from my gf ,like not letting me go to the parties she goes to too (we were in the same HS), taking away my cellphone for me to not to text my gf, not letting me even go to school some days, etc. 

Recently I confronted her after being caught with my gf in a mall, where we were shopping candies and some pastries, but my mom thought we were having sex all this time and made her mom think that too (destroying the little relationship my gf had with her mom in the process). My mom told me that she’s gonna disown me if I keep my relationship with my gf and not gonna let me go to college. I told her that her fear of my gf making me decide between my mom or her is non-existent (my gf has tried to be good with my mom: has bought her gifts, food, has invited her to go shopping together and talk, but my mom still refuses to change her view about her) and that SHE’S the one making me decide between her or my gf. 

So here’s the part of the seek for advice. Do you think that it’s bad to actually want to stay with someone at such young age? Do you think that our relationship may be toxic (codependent) ? 

I don’t know what to think anymore, so I appreciate any help, suggestions, comments and anything. 

P.S sorry if I have a bad English. It is not my main language"
577,"So, I’m honestly really torn about this one. I’m a long time lurker but I’ve never posted about my MIL before. I just feel like I need some guidance here. This is long, TLDR at bottom. 

**Backstory on me/DH:** We have been married 2 years. I’m 27, have two children from a previous relationship and we are trying for a #3. Husband is 30 with no bio kids yet. We live in a 3 bedroom home (2 up, 1 down).  

**Backstory on MIL/extended family:** She is 60, FIL is 65. They had two bio sons being my husband, and BIL who is 28. He’s married to SIL also 28, they aren’t sure they want children. When the guys were teenagers, MIL decided she desperately wanted a daughter. MIL doesn’t like children, So enter into the family Daughter (changed from fake name because I missed a rule sorry). Daughter was 15 at that time and from a 3rd world country.   I have actually never met her so I can’t speak to her character. But I’ve heard she was very troubled. Fast forward a few years.. 

Daughter ends up pregnant, and along comes her littleboy. Daughter took off, social services was involved and asked MIL if she would keep littleboy. Due to their age, FIL didn’t want to. But MIL insisted on keeping Littleboy. (Neither my husband nor my BIL were married yet and they didn’t think bachelors were suitable candidates to take littleboy in). Continuing, less than a year later, Daughter has another child, Littlegirl. Social services again asks MIL to take the child, so she does. 

Fast forward to now. 

Littleboy is now 6, Littlegirl is 5. (There was a 3rd child born, but MIL said no to her, and she was placed for adoption with a family that allows us all to visit and receive updates).  

So about last Christmas, MIL asked my husband if we would be guardians for them. He came home and asked me. I said we needed to sit down and discuss everything together with the whole family present before giving any answers.

I had so many thoughts .... I have two kids already, and we want a 3rd. 3 kids was my number. Our house cannot accommodate 5 kids (4 of which would be teenagers all at the same time). We can not afford 5 kids. And what about other situations? FIL has absolutely fallen in love with the children and he is their main caregiver. MIL is barely involved. If FIL is working, she shoves then in daycare from 7am-6pm even though she’s never worked a day in her life. If FIL dies does she expect us to take the children? I cannot co-parent with this woman. It’s way too much to explain in one post, but it’s just not even a possibility. For an idea of what I’m dealing with: she’s an anti-vaxxer. [also FIL’s father (husbands grandfather) passed at 62 due to a heart attack. FIL has already had 2 heart attacks. This is a real possibility for us sadly ...] 

So Husband mentioned this a few more times over the next few months basically like : “my mom wants an answer” and I continually repeated “we all need to sit down, and why isn’t she involving me in these discussions? I’m the one who would be taking care of them” (husband isn’t involved in child care). Not once did she ever bring the topic up to me - just to my husband alone. So six months pass and I assume she found somebody else because she stopped asking husband about it. 

Then this summer we are at the beach and she casually mentions she updated her will. When we get home, I ask my husband who she found for guardians. He doesn’t know. I asked if there’s a possibility she listed us... He says no, and tells me that his mom would never do that, since we never said yes. 

I stew on this for a month before getting up the nerve to ask her point blank “are we the guardians”. She was shocked, and even seemed angry that I asked. But then looked at me and said “yes”. I just looked at her and said “we never talked about this. There’s logistics to sort out”. And then she said “what logistics, if we are dead then you guys will have to figure it out”. I left it at that because she was so visibly upset and I just didn’t know what to say. 

It’s now been another couple months. Yesterday we had a big family dinner. All the kids were together and holy hell, was it absolute chaos. And I just felt weird. I love Littleboy and littlegirl of course, but I barely know them. I see them when I drop my kids at school and at family gatherings. SIL/BIL babysit them every Saturday and have a better relationship with them. They almost feel like strangers to me in a way. They’ve slept over at my house once and MIL gave me a  large sized ziplock bag filled with meds and instructions on how to administer them, along with a set of rules for the kids like no sugar at all, no tv, etc etc. The meds were mainly different sleeping meds ... 

I wouldn’t want to see them go into foster care but if I’m being brutally honest, I don’t think I could handle them. I’m sure it makes me a terrible person to say that, but it’s what I feel. And I just hate how she did this without ASKING me! Without talking about this! Who knows, maybe my fears would be alleviated if we all sat down and I’d say yes. But now I just don’t know ... 


TLDR: MIL (60) has custody of two kids (5 and 6). Asked my husband if we would be guardians, I requested we all sit down to discuss. We have 2 children already and want another. We couldn’t afford 5 kids and that isn’t part of our life plan. Months pass and I find out MIL updates her will and made us guardians without telling us first. I don’t think I want to be guardian, I’m conflicted about it.


So ... what would you do if you were in this position?


Edit: I am aware we can say no to the guardianship. It would just feel wrong to know about this, and not say/do anything now, and then in the future if the situation arrises suddenly say “we never wanted this”."
578,"I recently went no contact with my JNFMIL (few months ago) because her comments to and about me were very hurtful. My partner still tries to have a relationship with her, but he has said she isn't welcome to our home (just like I'm not welcome to hers). I won't get into everything that happened, just know that she went off the rails and accused me of many things that aren't true, and bf stood up for me. I haven't retaliated, and I most likely never will. I have no interest in talking to her or having her in my life, I always cut toxic people out because I just can't handle the screaming fights and petty arguments. It's kind of just hit me that I'm not sure how my future is going to go with my partner. If it was up to me id never see or think about this women again, but I know bf wants her at our wedding one day and wants her to have a relationship with any children we would have. This terrifies me, I don't want someone that has been so cruel and awful to both me and him at our wedding, let alone looking after or seeing our children. I don't trust her and she has no interest in trying to repair the relationship between her and myself. I reached out to her twice to try and each time she ignored me.  I have no idea what to do. Bf has made it clear he won't cut her out unless she does something bad to our kids, which I think is insane, I would not want to wait until she hurt my child to cut her out. I just don't know what to do, and whether I should stay in this relationship or what? I'm going to have a discussion with bf, we are very open and honest. But I just want to sort out what I'm feeling and how to say it to him in the way I mean it so we can work on a compromise. If that's even possible

Any advice would be amazing"
579,"A while ago we got our wedding photo preview, and my MIL Wreck-It Rose was only in one out of the 26 we got. I figured it was probably because of her sour puss. Our photographer posted the rest of the images online for us on Saturday and is mailing us our flashdrive now. I'm so in love with our pictures! You can see the love oozing from every picture.

Except....

So Wreck-It Rose doesn't ""do"" pictures. DH has made the joke before that if anyone looked through all the pictures of his childhood, they would think he was raised by a single father because WIR was always the one behind the camera. There aren't even any pictures of her at his first birthday party. When she *is* in pictures, she doesn't dawn a toothy smile, but does have at least a nice grin. Most of the pictures of her catch her grinning widely, especially if it's just her and DH or her and FIL, and she looks happy-ish.

Then we get to the family portraits. There are pictures of *just* DH with her and FIL and with *just* DH and FIL and SIL, and there are pictures of *just* me and my parents and *just* me and my parents and siblings. We all look happy, even my brother, who is one of those ""strong silent types"" who doesn't really have expressions in pictures and never has. Then there are the pictures with both the bride and groom with their parents and families. With my family, everyone looks happy. With DH's family, my smile is not super comfortable as I'm right next to WIR, the woman who has called me a whore to my face and tried to get DH to break up with me/make decisions behind my back/leave me stranded financially if I ever needed help. And WIR has this expression of..... Okay so you know the [Spongebob pajama boy meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pajama-kid)? That's her face in every picture she and I are in together. I definitely expected for something like this to happen (and if this is the worst that we got from the photos/her behavior then I consider it a win), so I find it really hilarious. What's even better is that she asked DH specifically for an 8x10 inch print of that photo for her to frame in her house. So every time I go over, I'll get to see a big copy of her pajama boy face and me at least *trying* to look nice.

Also as a funny side note: she asked for just a hair over 100 pictures to be printed. I don't know why DH agreed to print them, but I would 100% rather have to print off the pictures myself than give her a copy of the photo release. (If anyone's going to be cropped out of those wedding pictures, it sure as hell isn't going to be me!) So we went to print them, and the only one she asked for us to print that is me without DH, was one of the getting ready photos. I really like that photo, but let me set the scene. I'm in a Sunday school room relaxing. I'm reading a letter that DH had a bridesmaid give to me. My hair and makeup is on point. But I'm *just* starting to gather my stuff so I can get dressed, meaning I have my corset bra bunched up in my arm. The three focal points of the picture are my face, the letter, and BRA. And that is the only picture of me without DH that WIR asked to be printed for her. 😂

^(Edited to clarify the first paragraph.)"
580,"Last post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dcheli/mil\_is\_using\_excuses\_to\_get\_money\_from\_son\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dcheli/mil_is_using_excuses_to_get_money_from_son_help/) 

Just a brief update on the latest events.

After the last post DH and I had not really talked about the situation and funny enough there was no calls or texts or anything from MIL. It was as if MIL had NC us so I was ecstatic but it seems DH felt a bit hurt about it. He sent a text for her to check a news story he did and sent a link but she only responded with an ""ok"" and no response afterwards if she even saw it. It is then I am certain of DH role in the relationship with a narcissistic mother. She was mad that he did not give her money.

At the same time I was certain DH would not mention anything with the hopes I would have forgotten about not hosting his family for the holidays. Sure enough we were talking about funds and he mentioned he was in the negative and used the money he had in savings to pay bills and he had none to buy Winter clothes so he was waiting until payday. I got annoyed which led to a discussion about how ridiculous the situation is. I told him if he was to add the money he gave in the last few months alone he would not be in the negative. I then laid down my boundaries one more time which upset him about not including his family and how it is not fair. Which led me to blow up, I told him to tell me how fair it was to have his brother sitting watching our TV and cable and his stepfather drinking our liquor when they have done nothing to help his mother. I told DH that he is supporting 3 extra people and feeding his stepfather (which he can't stand) and brother when they do nothing to help his mother and how his mother does nothing to force them to contribute but has no problem calling DH for money all the time.

I told DH that I refuse to host any events, I will not cook or clean or do anything for the holidays to host his family until their situation changes and they stop asking DH for money and that his stepfather and brother step up to the plate. 

I also said that DH has to set boundaries with his money and how he gives it away. I could see it all started to hit home finally but just a bit. I know I need to continue to open his eyes and clear the FOG his mother has created.

Sidenote: MIL had a birthday that just passed and usually we take her out for dinner. I had no problems taking her out and I stated that in the past but DH mentioned a few days ago he didn't think he would have the money to take her out for dinner. He called his mother to let her know. In the conversation with her we found out that she was able to lower her rent even more, she still is getting workers compensation, she is still out of work (so now all 3 of them are home not working). DH let her know we wouldn't be doing the holidays because he might be working and he could not take her out for her birthday because he has no money. DH noted to me after the call that in talking to her every time he mentioned that he has no money and is in the negative his mother would change the subject to what she cooked for dinner. She did it both times he brought the subject up. She did not want to hear him talk about it.

MIL was disappointed but DH asked her if stepfather is taking her out and she wasn't sure. She said that she will get herself a cake and that got DH upset he told her that stepfather and brother should treat her on her birthday. (I am proud that DH went this route when talking to her. Usually when she guilt trips- DH would go and get a cake and card and gift card or money and drive down to her in the past). DH called again on her birthday to wish her a happy birthday and again MIL mentions that she will get her own cake and when DH asked why stepfather isn't getting her one she says he has no money. DH doesn't give an inch about going down there. His brother sends video later of MIL blowing out candles on cake- we are not sure who got the cake. I mention to DH that it is very odd that stepfather has no money when he gets $1000- $1200 a month  from disability and has no bills to pay and helps pay half of rent and groceries. (BTW rent is now $200 and groceries are about $300)."
581,"**E(again)TA: You are all correct. I will talk to DH about not going over for dinner until she shapes up with the side dishes. I'm not even asking for a full meal (I'm small and don't eat a lot anyway) but its definitely annoying to go somewhere hungry and then get offered bird food while everyone else gets ""real"" food.**

Edit: sorry, more context! The mother of the woman with the baby is MIL's best friend so she grew up around MIL and is very close with her. I'm new to this family dynamic, so as far as I know she doesn't mind ""auntie MIL"" and handed baby over of her own volition. As a result of their relationship, she and her husband are often invited over, especially when SIL is there because they are best friends. It isn't so much that I'm intentionally using her as a shield, as it is that she is already taking the focus off of me and I am embracing it :)

TL;DR: DH will invite a friend + his wife to dinner every time so MIL can play with their baby and leave us alone. Also we will leave our dog at home and use him as an excuse to escape early.

Hi, it's me again, the one with the dog in the tux! :D last night D(ear)H and I were invited over to his mom's house for dinner. They haven't really spoken since our wedding and subsequent move out of her house two months ago (and lord knows knows she hasn't spoken AT ALL to me!) so he was a little surprised, but wanted to be civil and accepted.

Some extra backstory because I love to complain about this woman:

I'm vegan for health reasons. She knows I'm vegan. But every. Single. Time. We eat dinner at her house she SUDDENLY REMEMBERS and lo and behold, all she has is salad for me!!!! :o she then proceeds to make a BIG FUSS, ""oh gosh I'm so SORRY I didn't know what to make for you so I have rice and salad! That's okay, right??""

I don't care because this happens every time but DH said, ""are you kidding? At least make her some beans!"" And MIL did the :o face again and said, ""I never make beans ha ha! I didn't realize she could eat those!""

So I had beans, rice, salad, and bread. Annoying, but not bad for one meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Now on to our two part plan.

Part 1:

We couldn't bring our dog because MIL recently adopted another little shitty four pound thing that she's not going to train and her two little dogs bully the big one, so I didn't want that for my pup since he has not met the new puppy.

Sidebar: I love dogs of all shapes and sizes, but all her dogs are brats and she won't discipline them. The newest one terrorizes the older ones and would have become a light snack for my boy, which would have resulted in all kinds of trouble. So he stayed home.

Doggo staying home was also a brilliant plan masterminded by DH since we stayed for an hour and a half and then he stood and said ""we have to go feed our dog, so we're heading out."" Small lie: we fed him before we went, of course! So now we will be leaving him home for very short periods of time and using him as our escape.

Part 2:

MIL invited her other son and his GF. That was fine. She did NOT tell us that she invited her daughter's friend (daughter wasn't even there!!) and her husband (who works with and is friends with DH). And...their new baby.

(As well as one of her church friends, but she's not important)

Guys.

She literally took the baby.

And ignored us the entire time.

Which leads us to DH's second brilliant idea: if we get invited again, we will ask her to invite this other couple. DH is friends with the guy, so they can talk (win) and MIL will take the baby and not speak to me (also win).

Thankfully, per DH this is not going to be a regular thing. Next time she asks, unless it's several months from now, we will ""have plans"" and be unable to make it.

Oh, and she posted a pic of us (with our backs turned, so literally the backs of our heads???) on Facebook because she can't control herself, I guess. I'm not friends with her, but DH and I were holding her new puppy jokingly like a baby, so I can only guess what the caption is 🙄 (we are planning to be child free and she is very upset about not having do over babies). But oh well, win some, lose some!"
582,"New user 👋

My (30F) MIL has constantly disrespected the only two boundaries I have in regards to family (1. Ask before showing up to my house/knock/etc. 2. Do not clean or reorganize my house without asking). She thinks that these boundaries are absolutely ridiculous and judges everything I do for my husband (31M) and stepson. I am 30 years old and quit my 6 figure career to take care of my husband’s non-verbal and autistic son full time. During this transition, I suffered a miscarriage and then became pregnant again shortly after. I am now 33 weeks pregnant. 

On numerous occasions she has completely disrespected me and my boundaries. To include trying to convince my husband to come stay with her when he had cancer instead of him being cared for by his wife. The stories are endless and I don’t know how I continued to always be nice to her. 

Things with my MIL took a huge turn when she went off on me in my own home about how I raise/take care of my stepson. Side note: His bio mom and I have a wonderful relationship and she knows exactly how I am working with her son. I set a boundary of her not being over at the house anymore as she was causing me severe anxiety in my pregnancy. My husband agreed.

My husband and I went on a one night babymoon to get away before our little one comes. When I arrived home today, she had come to my home and completely reorganized my stepsons room. I feel completely violated/disrespected.  My husband said he’s only mad she did it because of my reaction to it. Even when he says he will back me, he always sides with his mother. I have dealt with a lot of complications and stresses during this pregnancy. I feel like no one is advocating for me/my baby. I don’t even know how to handle this. My husband always says I don’t understand the culture (his mom is from Argentina). I am constantly telling him that I have no problem respecting her culture in her home and that she should respect me in my home as well.

I just need advice on how to handle this. I cannot put my health or my baby’s health at risk for this woman."
583,So I have good news The witch isn't taking DS trick or treating. I went off on DH after he kept trying to defend her and told him either I take DS with him or I'll stay with him in the room with the door deadbolted. He has since quit the second job and will now be taking DS with me. Even after all of this the witch is still pissed and making rude remarks but I don't care I'll be working soon enough and be going no contact.
584,"I apologize for my tenses (ex: said/says), I always seem to jump back and forth. Also I hope I'm not super confusing; my brain is in overdrive. Anyway. Here goes.

My JustNoMIL is part of a MLM company/pyramid scheme - that clearly isn't MLM/Pyramid - and she keeps trying to get me to join.

Years ago while Hubs and I were dating, JNMIL signed me up as a Not-MLM customer and told me I would thank her when I saw how good it was. I couldn't find anything I really liked and I cancelled it without telling her. This dropped her down a tier and she lost a percent of her commission. She was pissed but couldn't do anything about it. 

She kept going for a few months, trying to get her pitch in anywhere she could - children's birthday parties, family BBQs, church events - with no regard for anyone else. The day JNMIL and her husband met my parents, she had her Not-MLM packets with her. I told her if she even tried it, I would tell Not-MLM that she had signed me up without my permission. She didn't pitch, but she did talk about it a lot. So much so that my parents took her cell phone number just so they could block her from contacting them. She's still blocked to this day.

Now Hubs and I are married, we have a house and children and jobs ... and she's trying to get us to sign up with this company again. I ask why she's back on this pyramid. She says she never left, she gets commissions checks when her enrollees buy things; she only really goes hard on sales when there's an incentive she wants - like a super expensive car for the top earner in her district! She tries to recruit me again, I say no. She goes to my Hubs, tells him to tell me to sign up (LOL), he says no. She comes back to me and says I could quit my day job and just hang out with her and make sales calls all day. Ummmmmm hard pass.

A month goes by with no communication. Then Friday night while Hubs is working late (after 8pm), JNMIL ""pops by to say hello"" and just happens to have her not-MLM pitch kit with her! How convenient! And look how easy it is to make money with not-MLM! She's made $60,000 in just under 20 years! I point out that I made over 1/2 of that in one year when I worked at Wally World and that's about what I make per year at my current job. She isn't happy about that but she presses on. Look at all the great products! Look at the price comparisons! The commissions get better as you enroll people! Just tell all your friends they need to sign up, you'll earn off what they buy; then you get their friends to sign up and you'll both earn off whatever *they* buy!

Again I asked, ""how is this not MLM?"" She tried to draw the sales tiers several times but they all looked like ... pyramids! So I told her I didn't want to join, not as a buyer or seller, and she snatched up all her precious money making info and stormed out.

I told Hubs what happened when he came home shortly thereafter and he supported my decision. We don't have the extra money for this BS and she was way out of line to come by unannounced and try to corner me into enrolling. The weekend passed with no backlash. 6:30 Monday morning, she called to get me to reconsider, starting her whole pitch all over again. I hung up on her. She called back three times but I didn't answer any of them. I'm surprised she hasn't stopped by again.

I just wish she would take my answer for what it is. Berating me and cornering me are not going to change my mind! We've always had a tense relationship but the more she does stuff like this, the worse it gets. I'm going to scream at her someday. I can feel it coming."
585,"Grandma is still in the hospital. She seems in good spirits. She says she's going to make me her PoA once she's out. 

She won't let me do anything about the stolen stuff, but I changed all of her locks. She doesn't want police involved. 

My mother has gone off the deep end. I don't know if she's still here (she was in town to pick up some stuff she'd left with my aunt and visited grandma, who fell during the visit.) But..... She called my job. And told them I had an abortion. Then shot me an email saying if God had decided I didn't deserve a baby, then I don't deserve a job either. 

Let me just make it clear: not preggo. Never had a bun in the oven. 

My boss thought it was hilarious, at least."
586,"TL: DR at the bottom. 

Autumn break and husband and I had a wonderful day together strolling around town and having lunch together while our boys were at daycare (just for one day so we could have some alone time together). 

We come home and husband gets a call from MIL. As I’m talking to our contractor (house is being redone) I see him look at me and I hear him talking to his mother and I know the shit is about to hit the fan again. Happy feeling gone. He hasn’t said anything yet but we just got the kids to bed so I know it’s coming. 

My MIL knows no boundaries. She was widowed young (husband was 30yo) and has since relied heavily on her sons. My BIL doesn’t have any kids. She was a pretty easygoing MIL until I got pregnant with our first and she was all over me. Actually, no, we had had little tiffs before that. When I moved in with husband I wanted her to stop coming round the back unannounced and ring the doorbell like everyone else and she clearly hated me for it. Things like that. 

Ever since we had children she wants to be involved in everything and have a say in everything, from her demanding alone time with my son when he wasn’t even three weeks old to her wanting to do a “Christmas morning do over” at her house every year. No, she doesn’t want to give us presents to add to the pile, she wants to pretend Santa left some presents for my kids at her house too and watch the kids unpack. I’ve told her I don’t want to do this, I feel it takes away the magic of the one and only Christmas morning and why would Santa leave presents at grandma’s house where the boys don’t even live? I’ve had to fight her for this for years before she gave up. 

It’s led to hundreds of fights between me and my husband over the years. This summer we had another huge one. 
Son #1 and son #2 celebrate their birthday within two weeks of each other. Usually we throw one party but this year I wanted them both to have their own party. MIL always wants to spend the night as she’s old (78), lives an hour and a half away and has health issues. I hate having to have an overnight guest for a kid’s birthday party but OK, I guess I just have to deal with it. 

With the two separate parties however, I told husband I didn’t want her staying over for each of them. Here’s why: we spent a weekend with her at BILs house as we regularly do when he is out of town to take care of his farm animals (for the record, I told husband to invite MIL as I foresaw fan hitting shit around the birthday parties), a week later she stayed a night at our house because of son #1’s birthday and son #2’s was just two weeks later. Three sleepovers with my MIL in one month is just waaaaay too much for me. Plus, I was at home after being burnt out this past school year and at son #2’s party I would have just started the new academic year again and I didn’t want to spend a whole weekend with MIL _again_. 

It led to a huuuuuuuge fight between me and my husband because he’s stuck in the middle. His mother will lay the guilt trip on him and I want to stand my ground for once. I told husband she could take the train and we’d drive her home after the party. She didn’t want to do this because husband is rheumatic and she doesn’t want him to strain himself (except of course when she needs him to come over to fix her phone again or drive her to her doctor or whatever). In the end, husband asked my aunt if she could have MIL over for a night. Aunt agreed, said she’d be happy to help. 

Aunt and MIL came over the night before the party for dinner and MIL was obviously _not amused_ about having to go with aunt and stay with her. I pretended not to notice. Next day it’s son #2’s fourth birthday and aunt brings MIL back to our house. I took aunt aside and asked how it all went and she said they were fine, they’d had a nice enough time. It was clear however that MIL was mad. Hella mad. She hardly looked at me when she congratulated me and then ignored me. 

Other guests started coming and MIL kept on having the expression of an axe murderer on her face. She would engage in conversation and kept her answers short and bitchy. Halfway through the afternoon she told husband she needed to leave because of the train ride home. I gave a happy and perky “thanks for coming” and I when she left my mother and sisters immediately asked “WHAT THE HELL WAS UP WITH HER?! Did you guys fight?!” 

Even my mother, who always sides with my MIL, said she didn’t think it was wrong for me to not want an overnight guest for once. 

I didn’t speak to her after my son’s party and this past Saturday my BIL threw his birthday party. He had lots of people over including my MIL. I said hello to her when we came in and then avoided her for the rest of the evening. When we left and it was my turn to drive, I sat down in the car with the door open to adjust the seat after my husband had driven us down there and she came up and said “are we going to say goodbye to each other?” So I said “sure!” and kissed her but didn’t look at her. 

It felt good to ignore the shit out of her pity me ass but I also knew this would come bite me. 

Husband still hasn’t said anything. I’m not afraid of him or anything but I just don’t want to fight anymore. And after eight years of his mother trying to live vicariously through my little family I have had it with her. I don’t care that she has surgery coming up. I want her to be a part of the family and I don’t want to fight but I want her to back off. 

Is she seriously going to act like she doesn’t know why I didn’t talk to her at my BIL’s party? If looks could kill she would have had me dead and cremated at my son’s birthday. She made the whole thing so awkward and tense just because I wouldn’t allow her to stay over that ONE TIME. And she expects me to be all bright and bubbly the next time I see her?

I can’t count the number of times we took her and our kids to zoos, playgrounds, museums, Santa, weekend trips and whatnot and still she’s never satisfied. She’ll always make passive aggressive comments about how she hasn’t seen the kids in two months. Well, we both work full time jobs and the kids have sports in the weekends and we need time to ourselves too. 

She’s told me once she thinks of herself as part of our little family. And I told her “no, you’re part of our extended family, not our family of four” but she didn’t agree.  And this is how she acts. I feel she demands husband to take care of her like he is her husband. 

She always wants to be invited over and spend weekends with us and I just hate spending entire weekends with her. 

Anyway, I overheard husband saying “I’m not getting involved” on the phone and he still hasn’t said anything so I think he’s not going to either. 

TL;DR my MIL is a childish, petty, boundary stomping bitch who pretends not to know why I gave her the cold shoulder after acting all mad and entitled at my son’s birthday party. She whined to husband on the phone she doesn’t know why I ignored her and husband still hasn’t said anything about it to me yet."
587,"Throw away because I know my SIL is on Reddit. Sorry for any mistakes and super long post but I'm still upset and stressed out. I don't know if I'm just hormonal, 7 months pregnant, or if I'm finally fed up with MIL but she is planning to visit soon and I just want to hide for the entire week. 

I have been with DH for 6+ years and we've lived together basically the entire time. We moved fast when we first got together and I know my MIL has always held it against me, he lived with me and my parents for 2 years before we moved out of state. He doesn't think his mom dislikes me as much as I think she does but he can tell that she has some feelings she needs to sort out. In their family it's normal to just pretend everything is fine even if the world is falling apart. I can't stand this type of rug sweeping because I grew up with the same bs and it took a lot to tell people that my feelings matter and you can't just be horrible to me and expect me to not care. I cut off my own family for this behavior so I have no problem doing the same to in-laws. Sorry for the long rant but I felt this needed to be said to explain the upcoming visit.

Earlier this year my SIL and her family moved out of MIL's to live with us about 15+ hours away. Things were getting expensive and they wanted to try to get on their own. DH and I have had amazing luck being out here and now we both have great jobs and our own home. We agreed that we could help them get jobs and work towards their goal. Before SIL moved out here DH and I had also decided we were ready to start our own family. We let her know that was our plan before they came out, she has 3 kids all under the age of 7. I am excited to have them all out here and it's been great being an auntie to the kids. Since they moved out and I am now pregnant that means that all of MIL's grandchildren live here, she can't stand that.

If you've stayed this long thank you I know it's long but I'm almost to what led me to post. I'm not sure when or why it happened but MIL flipped out and told my YSIL, DH has 3 sisters, that I was taking her family from her and she didn't understand why DH would be with someone who obviously doesn't care about family. Well I only found out because one day DH asked me if I saw some random religious post from his mom on FB, I said no and went to her page to check it out. I couldn't see it because she had unfriended me on FB. I was kind of wondering if I had done it but I would remember something like that. She is always on FB and I know she'd mention to DH if I had, so I checked my other social media accounts and the same thing. I told DH she had deleted me from everything and that I hadn't noticed until now.

I'm pretty close with YSIL and messaged her asking if everything was ok with MIL and if she knew why I had been deleted. That's when she told me about MIL getting drunk and ranting about how all her children want to leave her and that she blamed me for it and was tired of seeing my passive aggressive post so she was deleting me to teach me a lesson. In all honesty I didn't care too much at first. I knew she didn't like me and how petty she could be but this was a whole level of low I didn't want to deal with. I told DH that I was going no contact and even if she apologized I'm not sure I want to try to have a relationship with someone who blames their children growing up on me. I didn't ask him to do the same but I wish I had. 

Last month she reached out to SIL, I try not to be too negative about her because she's still their mother, and started making plans to come out here for a week to see the grandbabies. At first I was like whatever I can work while she's here and just stay busy and not interact. I asked if she planned on getting an air bnb or hotel and the looks I got from DH, SIL, and BIL were a red flag. SIL couldn't make eye contact with me and DH and BIL looked confused. That's when SIL gives me an awkward ""sorry"" look and says she is planning on staying here. I felt really defeated in that moment and it was like every negative thing just came flooding into my mind. I just said ""right?"" And the subject was dropped. I needed to talk to DH about everything before I misplaced this rage I was feeling. 

When DH and I were alone I asked him why his mom felt it was ok to come stay in my home when she had been acting the way she had? They have plenty of money and getting accommodations wouldn't be that hard. I then asked where she planned on staying since we have a full house. His replies took me back he said that even though she's being horrible that's no reason for me to act the same. That she misses her kids and grandkids and if we don't let her stay here she'll feel even more strongly about her feelings. He also said that his family doesn't do things like stay at hotels when they visit family, total BS, and that he was planning on giving her an air mattress to sleep in my office/nursery. So not only is she staying with us but she is intruding on my only space in the house that's my own. I'm supposed to just suck it up because it won't be that bad. 


This is where I think it's hormones because I started crying and telling him that his child and I were being treated like we didn't matter. I'm going to be 8 months pregnant when she's here and all I want to do is get my nursery ready but she's supposed to be staying in there. She hasn't said a word to me still and I just don't understand how she feels so entitled to come stay in my home. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind when she's here because I'm pregnant and she hasn't even acknowledged it. She acts like it's DH's baby and even than she hardly talks about anything baby related with him. I told DH that if she was staying here I'd look for an air bnb for myself and my pets because this is all too much. He said I was overreacting and that now I'm being petty, so I cried more and since we have not talked much about the visit. I feel like a giant ball of emotions and I know his feelings about it so it feels like a waste of time to try to compromise. I don't want to cause bad feelings in the house but I don't understand why everyone is OK with her behavior. That being said I've been looking at this as a mini vacation for myself before the baby gets here I just wish she wasn't visiting around the holidays...

Smallish Update 
Wow, I didn't think this would blow up like it did but I'm thankful for all the support! There are a lot of good points being made but I do want to clarify a few things.
From my understanding DH didn't know about his mom visiting just that she has been talking about it, so SIL and BIL made that decision without any word to either of us. This is something that DH knows he needs to address and plans to. We talked for a bit on his lunch and made a plan for the two of us to get out of the house tonight to talk about this situation and spend some time together. I hadn't realized that since they've been here we've been doing everything together and it's not the worst thing but DH and I obviously have some things that need to be discussed. I let him know that the petty comment really hurt me and he apologized and said he should have worded his feelings better. It was a short talk but from the sounds of it he has been unsure how to apologize for his family and thought ignoring it would be best, like I said they were raised like this so it's something he needs to work on. I plan on showing him this post and all comments because it might open his eyes more. He is the GC and always feels like he needs to keep the family together. This whole situation has brought up so many memories of his mom and honestly I might be posting more because knowing I'm not overreacting has been the only thing keeping me from contacting her. Once again thank you for the advice and support I definitely felt like I was being given no choice in my own home. Why it took strangers online telling me this to realize it is beyond me but I'm hoping I can get DH to understand why I'm so against her staying in our home."
588,"I woke up this morning to a brand new batch of acne along my jawline. I am so self conscious, especially around my MIL/FIL because they mock me openly about it,  and of course today is Thanksgiving. 

Putting makeup on it hurts and makes it worse, but I usually do that to TRY and cover it up - but the insults still come. Any comebacks or shutdowns I can use tonight? It wouldn’t bother me so much if it didn’t happen right in front of my daughter.."
589,"Hi guys,

On Mobile, spelling, as always sorry its so long! TW mention of LO death (no details). 😊

So as a bit of a back story is that my MIL always pretended to be a JY, but I have come to the realisation that she has been a JN for years. I've dropped the rope since she has been an absolute nightmare since DS2 died. I want nothing to do with her and DH is seeing the light (mostly). She wants to be seen as the 'perfect Nanny, caring MIL/mum' on the book of faces, but in reality has nothing to do with the kids. 

If you want a catch up on her awfulness please see bitch bot. 

So in one of my last posts I described how she went off the deep end when we forgot to wish her happy birthday (she had cards and presents a few days before). Since the only reason she is on the book of faces is to stalk us and play happy families, I decided to go a bit extra on pointing out how amazing the rest of the family are, and noting when she cancelled on us. All done very passively aggressive and noting straight out aimed at her. (I did have to stop myself sharing a meme about my child not knowing you if your not in their life....) 

So she has definitely seen them all as she has ""loved"" every single one of my posts lately. Her pattern seems to have emerged. Has a stalk in FB every few days, ""loves"" all recent posts (even random check in's etc), sends DH a message about our lives based on recent post, wants to arrange a meet up. 

So the BEC messages following the recent posts are as follows:

I have gestational diabetes currently (30 weeks) and one of the medications made me really, really ill. Did a generic FB post about feeling shit and she jumped right on the band wagon. She sent me a private message as follows:-

*""Hi MissingMyBaby                                                   Sorry to hear you are feeling so crap now taking meds but not surprised as StepFIL does most of the time....hope you will get used to it and start to feel better.We went to GMIL's yesterday as will be away when it is my sister's birthday 26th also my Mum's cat died suddenly in the house the previous night and she was quite upset. She has a marvellous neighbour who she was able to call on and so glad she has as BIL is in Sicily. Anyway everybody sends you their love to you all and we do too. Take Care xxxx""*

Now am I over reacting (I genuinely might be) or is that just telling me to get over it between the lines? That StepFIL feels ill all the time and doesn't moan? DH was annoyed she messaged me over him, again (she has been told to send to him, never bothers with our group chat, I just forward messages on now and don't reply) and he said not to reply and left it. 

It was World Mental Health Day recently and I shared a video about anxiety, just saying that following recent events (death of DS2, and an sooner than anticipated pregnancy) I have had some anxiety recently. 

This is the message she sent DH (not my spelling!) 
*""I saw MissingMyBabys post on FB re anxiety it is a braue thing to own up to and I'm sure tragic euents haue affected you both mental health wise I struggle on a daily basis with anxiety / low self esteem - the reason I don't driue and gaue up nursing and sorry not been more supportiue hope can see you soon maybe next weekend? xxxx""*

That message just annoyed the hell out of me. DH called her out recently about the lack of support since DS2's death, and she is using my anxiety about it to curry favour?! 

Anyway this has now earned her the bonus of not knowing that I've been booked for an early C section, and that I might even be induced the week before that. We have only told my JYfamily, JYFIL and JYStepMIL as they will all rally around to help with DS1. All are under the instructions not to tell MIL as she hasn't been supportive through this pregnancy. 

The annoying thing is that she is coming here on Sunday. With a message to DH ""All being well, see you Sunday"", see what she did there, already giving herself a way out. 

So am I over reacting about these messages? It's it just BEC stuff? I feel like she is manipulative to DH and pretending to be nice and care. Yet am I just so annoyed that I'm seeing something that isn't there? 

I am sorly tempted to go out Sunday and leave DH to it, yet I don't think I can trust her not to be a manipulative bitch. As much as she annoys me, I just want to protect DS1 and DH from her as well."
590,"Hi folks, 

My fiancee and I just got married and we are excited and happy to start our new lives. We just have a final decision to make about splitting costs with family and can’t figure out the right way.

Short version: My mom agreed to paying for her guests (including family), in-laws agreed to paying for their guests (including family), and we are paying for all our friends. This was decided months before the wedding in email with cost estimates. DW, FIL, and MIL did ALL the wedding prep and NMom did none. We stayed below the cost estimates, and sent my mom a bill which she just paid to us, but we know from family that she’s been complaining about it. I want to pay her back for some portion of it, to prove that I’m not cheap. DW disagrees and thinks it sends the wrong message.

Long version long: 

My mom made our lives hell while planning the wedding. She decided it was her wedding and it would be her way, and after trying to compromise, we realized we had to make a clean break from that and do it our way. In the end, DW, MIL, FIL, and I did 100% of the planning and work, while my mom did 0, but took equal credit as the host. 

My mom kept saying that our wedding was an embarrassment and a mockery, and her whole community would be uncomfortable at the event. Her behavior seemed more like she wanted the event, just without doing any work. She wanted to invite a ton of friends/family, she clearly enjoyed herself the day of, and all of her relatives who she said don’t drink at all got blackout drunk. 

Initially, pre-drama, I committed to paying for a number of my moms guests but I changed my mind because it seemed like my mom wanted to invite a bunch more people now that she had a bigger budget. So we decided to handle all costs proportionately to guest count. Family pays for their family and friend guests. We, the couple, pay for all our friends. My mom was upset that we won’t pay for all the relatives, saying “I'm so disappointed. You don't even want your own uncle, cousins there at your wedding?” She then agreed and had just occasionally whined about it in the months leading to the wedding. 

My mother stirred up tons of drama and headaches throughout the wedding process because of the ceremony not going her way, but she has handed me the check for the wedding costs with surprisingly little trouble. To be clear she is financially stable, both my parents have full time jobs, own a couple homes, etc, and the amount to pay for her guests is significantly less than what she had said she was willing to pay when the wedding was 100% her own way. 

I feel like I should now pay her back. I’m impressed she didn’t raise a stink about paying us, and want to appreciate that. I also don’t want my mom to pay for her family because it feels like they should be guests, not paying their own way. At the least I want to give her all the monetary gifts we got from her friends because as the wedding sponsor, I feel like the gifts should go to her. She’s accused me of being a bad son, uncaring, and cheap for not doing things her way, and after doing one of these, I can clearly say that I am not a cheapskate towards my family.

DW feels I am blinded by misplaced guilt. She has made the point that we put in all the labor for the wedding, shared the credit with my mom, and are paying a significant portion ourselves already. She also said that the gifts are not meant to be given to the sponsor but instead, they are typically meant for the couple to start their new life. She also pointed out that when my mom was planning the wedding with none of our input, she still expected us to pay a significant portion, so it is fair to do the same to her. Finally, she points out that my mom will probably continue calling me cheap if that is the narrative she prefers, and giving her money now will just make me madder in the long run because it won’t change any of that behavior.

I still really want to give my mom money, but not sure if I’m making this decision logically or from guilt. Thoughts?"
591,"I’ve posted here before, my MIL is def not as bad as other JNMILs. 

I haven’t let her be alone with the girls (4 and 3) because she constantly plays dumb to my rules. 

For example- kids aren’t allergic to milk, but they get the shits and rashes from it. She constantly will ask if they can have a glass
of milk. Or will pull my husband aside to say how they NEED milk. 

There have been other little things, but today my guilt kicked in because I have been avoiding her, and my husband has been getting on my case for me to have ME time... with no help from him ofc.

Anyway- test 1.. she asked what I was doing today, I said we had plans with a friend but could cancel. Wow she took that bait didn’t even say she’d meet their friend, just she would be at my house at 8:30am.

Gets here today LATE and instead of taking them to the park right here- she HAD to take them near her house (gross but whatever!) then eat lunch by her house. I knew knew
Knew she wouldnt be back by the time i said bc she is a boundary stomper.

Ofc she was late- and my little one is on a strict nap schedule because I want to go to bed early at night

.Second- OD told me they were drinking “grown up” juice. (orange juice or apple juice not Honest or a kid brand.)

Like wtf. It sounds sooo dumb but it makes me livid. She KNOWS i say no to juice (to her. I let them have at parties but hide it from her!) 

Its something soooo stupid but its the point she brought them to her one bedroom apartment to be a sneak alone.

It makes me never wana go away or leave them with her. There is no discussing it because she plays dumb even now she says oh they cant have milk???? 🤬🤬🤬🤬

Sooo give it to me straight- am I spiting myself???


We have a babysitter- she’s young, and she is booked for Friday! 


Also- my husband is not a jerk when he says for me to have me time- without his help. He just has no time, he owns a business and is constantly on call. It’s really hard for him to work with them because they scream louder when he’s taking a call. He does help, gets them ready for school, feeds them picks them up. He just can’t commit to a full day and a full night right now.

He’s working on getting help with the business because he’s for real close to having a heart attack."
592,"Edit to add: I cannot block her number. The only option I have is to automatically send her calls to voicemail and to silence her texts (meaning no text tone when she texts). There's a spam option for text, but I don't know if I can remove a number from spam. 

Link to original (hope I did it right) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dgw6vd/am_i_wrong_for_what_i_said/

I'm back, because of course I am.

I asked my mother to give me some space and allow me to de-stress. I also asked everyone involved (that I'm still on speaking terms with) to give me a few days to just deal with the stress/anxiety this has caused me, as I was threatened with arrest for harassment and I am my husband's only caregiver - being in this situation has me beyond upset because without daily care, my husband could die.

Of course, immediately after this I receive a string of texts which I respond to as we were mid conversation. But then I reiterated that I need her to give me some space for a few days and she responds bashing cousin for causing this drama and trying to destroy our relationship.

I told her the only person destroying our relationship was her and that if she ever mentions cousins name to be again, I will cut her out of my life. I went on to say I'm tired of her victim blaming a sexual assault victim and supporting her abuser, even if it's indirectly. I then said I was done with this drama and would be taking my space. She sent two more texts to say goodnight and that she loved me immediately after that.

The next morning I woke up with a text from her saying the payment for Netflix came through (we share several streaming services - that's the only one she pays for) and the amount. I barely glanced at it, at the time, and didn't respond. I spent the entire day, aside from the moment of annoyance when I woke up, free from the drama - everyone else had respected my request.

Last night I was finally able to de-stress enough to have a panic attack. My anxiety had been so high for so many days that I didn't even realize I hadn't been eating/drinking properly. I had 20 oz of water in a two day period and I had only eaten once. After the panic attack I was able to fall asleep and I slept better than I have in a long time. But again, I woke up today to a text from my mother correcting the amount she listed on her text from yesterday.

Like, I 100% know she's doing this as a form of boundary stomping. She is sending innocent texts so, if confronted, she can act innocent and claim she thought I meant no contact concerning cousin or the drama.

So what do I do here?

Do I just continue to ignore and every text add 24 hours to her time out?

Do I respond with an explanation of what I am asking for and the consequences if she doesn't respect my request?

Do I just hold to my original ""few days"" request and tomorrow or Wednesday reach out and ignore the texts from today and yesterday?

And I know NC is the way to go. Right now, with my husband's health issues, I need all of the support I can get. My brother and sister-in-law are about to have a baby (like, in the next two weeks) and I know that NC with my mother will result in NC with my brother and sister-in-law. He's the GC and doesn't see her behavior as anything more than annoying as she doesn't treat him the way she's treated me (she continuously tries to parent me despite never attempting to when I was a literal child - she's 20 years too late).

So yeah, I'm being selfish and trying to not go NC because I don't want to be cut off from family. Is there any other viable option here?"
593,"On mobile. 

Help me out folks. You may refer to previous posts to see why I consider JNMIL a danger to my child. SIL is somewhere in between JY and JN. MIL has poor judgement. Drove with SIL’s children while intoxicated (marijuana and alcohol). Drinks, gets high, want to hold my child which I object to. Has a history of removing LO from my arms without asking for saying a word. Obsessed with being alone with my child, tries to make this happen and get rid of me when she’s around. 

DH wrote up a contract of sorts that he reviewed and sent to MIL. It covered rules to keep LO out of harm’s way related to MIL’s inappropriate lifestyle but it also addressed issues like: baby grabbing, food shaming and mom shaming me, being rude and unsupportive regarding parenting choices. 

DH agreed that visits would be arranged such that he would be around to babysit his family around LO and OP. Well SIL needs to reschedule the trip with her and MIL and wants to come during the week. DH WORKS ALL WEEK, 9-5! I don’t want to be alone with MIL and SIL. I’d be ok with hosting SIL and her daughters all week without DH but not MIL. SIL told DH that she’s babysit MIL with me but I don’t consider this a good option because I think she’s still in the FOG. I have this fear that they will gang up on me. 

Am I obligated to host DH’a family without him present? If it was any other people from his family I’d have no hesitation. If it was just SIL, fine! But, I am just about unwilling to have MIL around without DH. She’s manipulative and has SIL in the FOG. 

I have terms when it comes to DH’s family visiting but my intention is not to make it impossible. At this time my rule of DH having to be around would make it impossible for them to come. Do I buckle up for a miserable week?

UPDATE: SIL has freaked out and shown her true colors. DH and I are going to marriage counseling this evening but for once as a united front to get advice on how to deal with his family."
594,"I don't really need advice, this is more of a rant and am in need of some support. 

Ever since things with my JNM went sour (aka I came out of the fog) I have been unintentionally trying to fill that void in my life. Any time I meet a woman around her age I have this feeling of hoping this woman and I might connect and she would essentially adopt me as my own. 

I kind of feel like that baby bird from the book. Asking everyone if they are it's mother but in the end I know they aren't and that my real mom is a narcissistic monster that abused me until my 30's. 

I have been talking to my therapist about it and I'm working on it. She suspects that I still miss/crave having someone take control of things for me when life gets tough, which is true, right now things are tough and I wish in a way someone would take control and help. DH can only do so much. 

I guess with Thanksgiving happening this weekend and Christmas coming I'm feeling extra alone and needing that supportive, motherly figure in my life. 

I am sure I'm not the only one that feels this way."
595,"Hello, everyone. I have to get this off of my chest because it is eating at me and I don't like it. 

Quick background: I've known my husband 10 years. Friends for 4, together for 6, married for 2 of those. I have a child from a previous relationship and we have one together. Husband is the oldest of 3. 

Ok here goes nothing. One of my biggest fears (before getting together with SO) in getting married/ having more children is that my future inlaws would treat my oldest child differently than any biological grandchildren. Cue my husband's parents seeming wonderful and calling my child their grandchild from the get go and everything being wonderful. 

Cue me getting pregnant and all that going right out the window. I should note that my FIL has never treated my oldest child differently. This is a MIL rant. She was sooo excited. I mean, my BIL and SIL have repeatedly expressed that the chances of them having kids is 0 to none, so I get it. My husband didn't like kids before he met mine, so she never thought she'd have grandbabies. I tried to remember this as she bought almost everything on my registry, leaving my family asking me what they should do, and forcing me to have a baby shower I didn't want. She's also the type to do shit like booking a flight and letting us know when she's coming, rather than asking us when a good time is. She came out for a week and a half after the baby was born and it was very stressful. She threw a fucking fit that I didn't throw a massive 1st birthday party and bought the 2 things I said I was going to buy the baby. Shit like that left and right. We stopped getting along because I started standing up to this bullshit. 

The core of the issue is how she treats people, but especially how she treats my husband. I'd noticed she was low key shitty to him ever since I first met them. I don't think he realized until I continually pointed out to him that she was demeaning him. From a psychological perspective, I get why she is, but it angers me to my core. She needs to be needed and is extremely controlling. My husband started working in high school, joined the armed forces and was out of there at 18. Since then, he's never asked his parents for anything. He's never been unemployed. He is a wonderful husband. He treats oldest child like his own. He's amazing with our baby. He busts his ass at work. He helps my grandparents with things when they need it. She should be so fucking proud of him. I would love for our kids to turn out like him. Well, she isn't. She doesn't like him and I genuinely don't know why. I know she needs to be needed, but it's clear she doesn't even like him and it fucking kills me. She doesn't treat her other kids this way. I hate it. 

We begrudgingly go see them once a year. We used to look forward to this trip but the last few years were not fun. We only went this year because BIL was graduating from college. The inlaws got a hotel room big enough for us to share, we tried to get out of it, we lost. Our baby was having trouble napping in new surroundings so I stayed with them for nap. My inlaws come back with groceries and proceed to slam cabinets whilst putting things away. My husband asks if MIL can close the cabinets quietly since baby is sleeping and she lost her fucking mind. She proceeded to cuss him out, in front of oldest child btw, and then didn't speak to my husband the rest of the trip. I was fucking floored. Had BIL not been graduating the next day, we would have left. I was furious. In an attempt to not make shit more awkward, I just avoided her and kept it together until we left. 

This was 4 months ago and we haven't heard from her since. My husband has attempted to call her several times because this is stupid and he's over it. She's holding him hostage emotionally by not answering or returning his calls. He can't have peace because he doesn't know why they're fighting. Our oldest child's birthday was 2 months ago and she didn't even text them. No call. No card. Nothing. FIL called and sent a gift card. I was absolutely beside myself. Oldest child is a teenager and is definitely old enough to have noticed. I cannot describe how much watching them be hurt over this upsets me. 

Yesterday we saw my family and my grandmother mentions to my husband that she got a birthday card from MIL and a lovely letter. I just nod and smile because my grandmother isn't involved in this mess, but I internally implode. I am fucking LIVID you guys. LIVID. How fucking dare she kiss up to my grandmother to keep her fake nice facade up when she skipped oldest child's birthday and hasn't asked about either child since picking a stupid fight with my husband. It's not like I haven't mentioned this to my grandma. I am angry at myself for not seeing this snake in the grass for who she was. I am angry I let her spoil oldest child just to rip the rug from them because husband stood up to her. I mean, how dare he ask her to be quiet so our BABY could sleep. What a bastard 🙄

The baby's birthday is next month and I'm extremely curious to see what will happen because we sure the fuck aren't inviting her out. Her favoritism of this child is so apparent, I kind of hope she tries to come out so we can tell her to kick rocks. I am mostly sad that my kids don't have either grandmother (my mother is also batshit) and my FIL is held hostage so they don't get a grandfather either. My father passed a few years ago. This is just not how I saw this situation turning out and it's endlessly frustrating. 

If you made it this far, I commend you. Sorry for the length. This is far from everything but I just had to get this out somewhere. My husband gets stressed out when we talk about MIL too much so here I am."
596,"Okay... so my JNMIL is a narcissistic witch. She has serious issues. I try to be empathetic but it’s hard when she’s so miserable and mean. She’s a drama queen, so miserable, and acts like a child.

Just some background:
1. She doesn’t like me because I asked my SO at the time if I could grab a snack from her pantry and apparently they have fallen in hard times. So me asking for a snack meant they were gonna starve?
2. I walk into her house and she doesn’t acknowledge me.
3. When our Daughter was born she called me a bitch to my newborn. I literally had just given birth and was incredibly emotional. And who does that?
4. Her daughter came out as gay and she disowned her. JNMIL tells people she only has 2 sons now.

So story time:
My fiancé and I have been together for almost 8 years. We just recently got engaged in July of 2019. Fiancé planned the whole thing. He proposed on the beach. We were on vacation with my grandparents, our two daughters, aunt, and my cousins. He had told some of his family a week prior that he had bought a ring. They said didn’t tell anyone. So he proposed and my family is ecstatic. His cousin then calls his mom to talk shit. Well his mom didn’t know. His father didn’t tell his mother which is fine. My fiancé was gonna tell her. So JNMIL texts my fiancé PISSED because he didn’t tell her. So he calls her and explains to her that he was gonna tell her once we got back to the hotel and so forth. This woman starts crying about how my family knew first and how her son doesn’t care about her because she didn’t know first and blah blah blah. She completely ruins the moment for him. 

Fast forward to two months later. Everyone has said congrats to her except her. They come over to visit and we just chit chat. She asks to see my ring and that’s about it. They leave. She texts my fiancé the next day and says “you didn’t say happy anniversary to us yesterday”. 

What? My fiancé doesn’t keep track if that stuff. He’s terrible with dates. But seriously?!? This woman hasn’t congratulated us at all. She’s still pissed about it and talks shit to her niece about the whole thing."
597,"I am new here, and this is my first post! I don't know all the abbreviations, so sorry if I spell something out I shouldn't have. 

My now (thankfully) exMIL is a piece of work. Her daughter, my exSIL can do no wrong. Before I was in the picture exMIL had a tiny pea size tumor removed from her breast via a lumpectomy. Fast forward a few years I marry her son, his 3rd wife (should have been a sign). She never got along with any of his wives. 

At the age of 35 my GYNO had me do a baseline mammogram. I was told all was well.

Then at 40 I had my first ""official"" mammogram. I received a message via online portal to have another exam as the Radiologist ""saw something"". So I went back and had a diagnostic mammogram. After the exam, the Radiologist said something is definitely there. 

The day before my 41st birthday I had a biopsy. It came back positive!! I was in total shock. In the weeks that passed, it began to spread. You could feel it through the skin.

My exMIL wanted me to to discuss things with her since ""she had been there"". However, I was in shock, and wanted to talk to no one! I was embarrassed. I didn't even talk to my own Mother at that time!

I ended up having a double mastectomy and some lymph nodes removed on one side. Now I was even more depressed. I felt that every one could tell. Once I was healed enough and no cancer cells remained I began the painful reconstruction process.

Here's the kicker..... 

My exMIL was telling anyone that would listen that I FAKED having breast cancer for attention!! Her reasoning was because I refused to discuss things with her! 

She hurt me so bad I ended up on anti-anxiety meds, anti-depressants meds, and seeing a therapist! 

First of all I don't know why anyone would want to fake having breast cancer. My insurance company wanted proof before paying. And my boobs were perfect. I never had kids due to having uterine and cervical cancers earlier in life. My now ex-husband even told her he was at the hospital when my surgeon came out of surgery and told him that the cancer was aggressive and on the verge of spreading everywhere had we waited any longer! And she didn't believe her own son (he was not the favorite child)!!

Thankfully now I am no longer associated with that family. When we divorced last year I even took back my maiden name to literally cut all ties!

I am now engaged to a wonderful man who has a normal family that treats me as their own. I am also a 6-year survivor of being cancer free!!"
598,"Hallelujah! My JNMother and my JNSister did NOT SHOW UP! No cops had to be called and it went very smoothly. 

Now hopefully the only time I have to deal with them next is family Thanksgiving, which is just my mom's side of the family, I don't plan on going to just ""our family"" Thank God my parents are divorced. 

We have Christmas Eve with my mom's side of the family, and then we go to my JNmoms after. This WON'T be happening. Maybe then she'll take the stick out of her own ass. I doubt it. But at least I have my JYdad to lean on and go to a much better Christmas. 

Thanks for all the advice! I appreciate you all so much! I'll keep y'all updated around the holidays! 

May post other memories as it comes up and I remember!"
599,"Okay, so for a short recap: mom is Staples.  Staples hates my FH because she is ableist.  FH and I are keeping engagement a secret from my family because of her.  

So Staples invited my FH over for (Canadian) Thanksgiving, today.  There were problems going on on his side of the family that caused delay in full answer.

Well, doesn't matter in the end.  Staples was talked into making something FH is allergic to by my GB brother (stories on post history and justnofamily).  So I basically told FH to not worry, they're insisting on making X meal that he can't eat because of Y ingredient.  Since they didn't want to put in effort for actually including FH, I'm not putting in effort for dinner either; including not putting on a bra.

Gonna head over tomorrow, where FH and I are gonna have a cheap tradition for Thanksgiving: chicken tenders and chocolate milk.

So overall, I suspect that Staples and GC wanted to look like they were putting in effort, but when it came down to it they didn't want to put in effort (picking FH up and making food he can eat)."
600,"Tiny amount of background and a trigger warning: QOE has cut my son out of her and my father's life. It has been 11 years since she accused him of raping my niece. There was zero evidence of this happening. Including my niece saying that it didn't. BUT my son was outshining her natural born grand children and she is adept at being the Destroyer of Worlds. Hence her JN name ... Queen of Evil.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to yesterday. My oldest son (OS) is married and has a son. He has a daughter due in about a month. I threw a little baby shower for them at my house. I did not invite QOE, and she was fine with that. BUT she wanted me to gossip with her. See, most people in the family have gone NC with her and my Dad. They have done this because of the way she treats *me.* I still see them because I love my Dad and refuse to abandon him. Absolutely no one holds it against me.

BUT She thinks my brother won't talk to them because of his wife. She says that SIL tore Bro away from the family and has forced him to only be a prat of *her* family. What she does *not know* is that Bro and SIL may still live together, but they are now legally separated. That's his business, so I won't tell them.

We had a lovely day and for the record I had invited my SIL, but she declined. We both did the right thing, everyone was happy. I posted pictures of the event on the book of faces and almost immediately received this text (which I left unanswered until today)

""*Hey did ""niece"" say anything about coming over to see her Grandfather. She doesn't want to see me that is fine but she could call him and meet him somewhere even if it is for a coffee. Was SIL (bitch) at the shower also.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Not question marks. Periods. These are demands. Everything I put here was exactly what she sent me. She knows that she is the problem. But, what she doesn't get is that people distrust her so much that they will not meet Dad somewhere with out her. They are very open that they feel it is either a trap and she will pop up out of the wood work, or that Dad will pay dearly for it once he gets home.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not answer her until this morning and only because I got a private message on FB:

""*Do I have your correct phone#. Sent you a text and you did not answer it. So I was wondering if I have the right number!!""*

Demanding. Almost accusing. So I sent her back a simple text saying ""*SIL did not go. No one mentioned Dad at all""*

&amp;#x200B;

Her reply: *""What was her excuse to not be there. Probably had better plans with her family. If Niece doesn't want to see us that is her loss. Take care of the ones that spend time with us""*

&amp;#x200B;

I told her ""*She did not give an excuse. She just said No""*

&amp;#x200B;

I keep trying to be minimal in what I say to her. I'm trying not to play into her bad behavior. Now, this 68 year old woman who, may I remind you hates my son (the nephew she is about to mention) responds thusly: *""She is such a biatch. That is her nephew! Does not surprise me. If it is not her family she can't be bothered. Karma is a bitch.*

To which I replied ""I agree"". because it's true, QOE. Karma IS a bitch. At this point this has ended, but I do not believe it is over.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. This senior citizen really said biatch. But anyone who read my last entry about her knows that is not surprising

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: For those who aren't familiar with my story QOE is my Step Mother"
601,"My mom is usually JustYes and lives far enough away that she only visits my kids (4 and 2) a few times a year. 

She's mostly great helping with the kids but if I'm in the middle of disciplining the 4 year old or explaining why we do/don't do something, and she's in earshot, she ALWAYS chimes in with additional explanation. I try to keep explanations short and sweet so I don't overload a 4 year old attention span and I feel like she always over-explains to the point that it's more confusing for him than helpful. It makes me feel like a kid, like I can't manage my own children without the help and wisdom of Grandma!

I'm looking for what to say or write to make her aware that she does this, and that it bothers me, and that I'd like her to stop. She's really not being purposefully malicious so I'd like to approach it gently. And it's not that I want her to never discipline the kids. Like, if you are the first one to see them standing on the table you can say something. But not if I've already handled it! 

Can you expert JustNo wranglers help me?"
602,"And she strikes again.

I’m extremely sick and back in the hospital. I have been most of the week. My liver and pancreas functions are diminished and seriously abnormal. And basically all my blood tests are super whack. I can’t keep any food down despite every antiemetic known to man and made one friend that has come to visit me cry because I apparently look that terrible...yay. 

So, I had posted on Facebook a ridiculous meme and a brief update on what’s going on and an appeal for visitors, because this freaking sucks. 

When crap went down last time, I deleted every in law and mutual friend we had on any social media because I wanted her to know nothing about my life.  I must have missed one. There’s a mole and I don’t know where.

She texted DH.

“I heard Thidwick doesn’t feel good. I really hope you and the kids are ok. Let me know if you and the kids need me for anything.”

Any mention of am I okay in there? Concern for my well being? For the fact I am critically ill and no one knows how to help me? I’m pretty sure she’s just hoping this episode is the one that finally kills me. Bitch, I’ll live just to spite you.

In a normal family maybe someone would say oh she’s just worried about the effect this scary situation is having on her son and grandchildren. Bull shit. This is the woman who told my husband while I was hospitalized for a bursting gallbladder to “enjoy the quiet and batch it up while she’s away.”

This is the same woman who when I had to spend 10 days in the hospital with sepsis to enjoy myself and the nice break. I’m sorry, is the ICU a fucking spa?

She sent a package a couple of weeks ago full of crap from the GC’s college. I was going to throw it away but I felt guilty about the waste of clothing so I donated it. I’ll donate any Halloween package too. 

For the record, DH has ignored everything and has not acknowledged her existence since the infamous driveway debacle.

Thank God they’re giving me Ativan or I’d be tempted to send a scathing email. Writing this was enough...

I wonder who the mole is..."
603,"On mobile, sorry if the formatting is awful. 

I have a JN Grandmother that I have been VLC with for the past 20 years or so since high school. I avoid her like a plague infested rat, which is honestly impressive since she lives next door to the house I grew up in. Yes my poor mother has lived next to her JNMIL for the past 33 years (and will be till my poor grandfather passes and my father feels OK moving away from his JNM). 

She has called me about 6 times in the past week (which I have ignored because the timing has been terrible) till yesterday just to keep the peace with my poor parents (when I don't answer she tattles to them). *Side bar. She has 4 grandchildren I am the only one she bothers* 

So I go about my normal greyrocking about my pregnancy and life till she finally calls me out on not answering/calling back sooner. I should mention at this point that my JNGM is like a stage five hoarder, I mean no clear surfaces, one path way through the house the kind of thing you see on those shows. Has been like this for most of my life despite numerous attempts to getting it cleaned up. 

But I digress, I explain that I have just been very busy and haven't been able to call or talk. She proceeds to question me as to how I could be so busy, and without thinking I go ""because it's a lot of hard work to make sure a house is clean and organized"". 

This woman, oh this woman, proceeds to say, very seriously ""oh sweetie, I know"" and goes on and on about keeping house. I have never laugh snorted so hard in my entire life until I had to excuse myself from the call saying I drank some water and it went down ""the wrong pipe"".

Sorry if it was a bit long! I have some stories about her but not many.

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title, I don't know how to edit it"
604,"Long time lurker but it's my first time posting here so please forgive any mistakes. Throwaway because privacy.

So, my ILs are normally pretty okay. They live a good four hours from us so we see them only about four or so times a year. D(ear, usually)H and I had our first baby 18mths ago and try to maintain regular contact for her sake. His parents engage in some BEC behaviour but this is the first time I've felt I need advice.

So it was recently my birthday and as my gift my husband said he would take me on a day out. At the time, I asked to go to a convention happening this past weekend. A few days after this was planned his parents informed him that they had time booked off for the weekend including the day we planned to go. They wanted us to go to them to spend some time with them and for them to see our LO. DH apologised and said we already had plans to go to the convention. They were disappointed but appeared understanding.

Last week we re-evaluated going to the convention and decided that dragging LO there and back by public transport would be too stressful. So instead we made plans to visit a well known public garden I like. This garden happens to be near my JYMum and so we invited her and stayed over her place the night before to make travelling easier.

As you do on a fun day out, I posted some pictures of us enjoying the day out on a couple of social medias. Mostly cute pics of LO but also some including JYMum.

This evening, DH rang his parents to tell them some exciting news we've been worki towards for a long time. DH was really excited to tell them and FIL and SIL seemed happy for us and excited. However, when the phone was passed to MIL she instead berated him for ""blowing off his family"" to see my mum and that it isn't fair that JYMum gets to see us and LO more. She also insinuated that he has lied about the convention plans to cover up our trip. DH tried to explain to her that it was my choice to invite JYMum on the trip and as it was my birthday gift I could invite who I like. She continued to repeat the above statements and then just handed the phone back to FIL and sulked.

DH came and told me this looking very upset. He feels guilty for not seeing his parents but feels he's done nothing wrong as it was my birthday gift. We sat down to talk and lots more grievances came out such as that MIL never rings him to catch up (unless she wants something) and it's always him ringing them. His parents didn't bother to get him a birthday card or present this year or even call him on the day. They very rarely make the journey to visit us, we travel to them more often. MIL's psychotic dog she never trained and causes havoc when we visit making it unpleasant to go to their place. Lots of little things that have built up in his head. He now feels sad and that his memories of the trip out are tainted because MIL has guilted him into believing he is playing favourites.

How can I best support DH with this? I've told him he is not responsible for how MIL feels and that her not responding to our news reflects on her not us. I've also suggested that he maybe stop making his weekly phone call and all the effort with MIL when the contact is rarely mutual. Is there anything else I could do or say to help?"
605,"I moved for college about 4 months ago. I'm super happy here and school is going well. A few weeks ago both of my parents told me they were going to visit for a few days. My dad's visit was this past weekend, and my mom's is this coming weekend. The visit with my dad went great, and we had a good time catching up! However, I'm not lookin forward to my mom's visit. For some reason she has it in her head that 

1. Shes going to sleep in my bed WITH ME

2. She can go through my stuff

I'm not comfortable with either. Life has been 100% better without her boundary stomping, and I'm really nervous to have her visit. How do I let her know my boundaries without disrespecting her?"
606,"Forewarned is forearmed. I like words. 

If you’ve seen some of my previous posts, you know we get or give quite frequent visits from the ILs. Only in passing have I mentioned my parents because I can better control their visits. I’m having JNM come to stay this weekend. Ugh. 

Before anyone says, just don’t have her come! I definitely limit her visits. I also have the blessing of her working and being single, so not too much spare money to come visit as she needs a plane. 

Anyway, I brought up the in laws because between them and JNM, they would bring multiple gifts for the kids on every trip to see us. The toy/book/clothing situation got out of control. So I called the kibosh on gifts unless it’s a birthday or Christmas. And I mean all gifts. MIL at least asked if that meant art supplies (the answer was yes). Apparently I needed to stress this to my JNM more because she showed up next visit with not one, not two, but three books. Okay, you are probably side-eyeing me for this, because who complains about books? I’ve probably got over 100 kids books and nowhere to store the dang things. They are stacked random places right now. Clutter bothers me and it drives my DH crazy. This simply does not work for us. I threw a slight tantrum at my mom saying NO MORE. Yes, books count. 

I’m talking with her yesterday on the phone about her visit. It goes something like this:

JNM: What do the kids need?

Me: Nothing. We’re all set. 

JNM: *pushes for everything from clothes to bath soap*

Me: NO. We don’t need anything. 

JNM: how can I be a grandma (which is not the asinine name I actually allowed her to choose for herself) if I can’t spoil my grandkids with presents? I don’t even know what size the girls are currently wearing (win on my part?)!

Me: You could be a grandma by playing with them when you see them. 

JNM: *hems and haws*

DH in the background: she could spoil them when she’s here. 
I concur and relay that suggestion, because honestly I won’t turn down bath soap. 

JNM: *excitedly* oh ok!

I now anticipate a push to go shopping while she is in town so that she can buy all the stuff I won’t let her bring. And like I said, I won’t turn down free bath soap or clothes even. I just don’t want to make it into something where my child expect gifts every time a grandparent visits. Plus, we really do have a lot of shit. 

Watch for a minor explosion in the American South if she does bring stuff."
607,"My mother is Deflector Gaslight who after upsetting my kids about their hair when they were trying to share other personal info, does not understand why they became incensed and dropped contact. DS sends and answers the occasional text, but DD is ignoring/avoiding contact. She is in college, she has better things to do than stroke my mother's ego.

I have also mentioned that I am basically NC with Deflector Gaslight's GC - per his demand. DG wants me to make amends, but since she is triangulating, I am sorry that her wishes will remain unfulfilled. She requests that every friggin' phone call. And she calls me stubborn....

Now, onto the fun. Two weeks ago, I received two FT calls from GC. I knew immediately that one of his children (much, much younger than mine) had to have grabbed GC's or his wife's phone. I declined the calls. Then, last week, DH told me that GC was calling me on the landline (we have one for those relatives who do not understand cellphones) and we ignored it. I later checked the messages and it was actually a call from Deflector Gaslight. I was busy and decided to call over the weekend. She called two more times.

I eventually called her back. I told her that her ID was coming up with GC's name. She correctly surmised that is why I have not been answering. She started in on the need to make amends. As soon as I pointed out that I was following GC's demands, she deflected the conversation at warp speed. Then my lying began. Where was DH? Out with a friend. And DS? Really busy with the school play. DD has not been texting her. I have not really seen DD, busy with school. So glad it was on the landline because I suck at lying to someone's face.

DH and DS were on their annual guy's trip which just happens to be very near where GC lives. I was under strict orders not to tell Deflector Gaslight because she would have told GC and he would have hot-footed it to join them. They did not want to see him. As for DD, she came home for the weekend and was taking a shower.

Then, Deflector Gaslight threw me a friggin' curveball: she knew DS had a girlfriend. I was in shock, because I know DS is refusing to tell her because then she would start in on why DD does not have anyone. DG claims it was on FB, but DS only has an account because he thought he would like it and is too unmotivated to nuke it. I checked with DS. He admitted to posting photos on the Gram with his girl. Then he remembered that GC's wife follows him on the Gram.

SOOOOOOOO, the people who cut us out of their lives are playing FM's to my mother who is upset that she does not have more contact with my ADULT children. 

I know my kids are legally adults and they need to handle their relationships, but how do I keep from exploding? I really want to scream at Deflector Gaslight that triangulation is not cool and if the FM's do not want us in their lives, then do not friggin' follow my family on the Gram.

Am I overreacting? Should have I told the truth? Am I the wrong one here?"
608,"This is an oldish thing. Still amuses me. But it’s come up recently and need a little help with how to move forward. 

So I was diagnosed with a personality disorder, no big deal; a relief actually, helps put everything together and get through things in my own way. I was having a conversation with my SO about it to tell him how to help me going forward ect, my FMIL was eavesdropping and chose this as the time to tell us that she wishes she had a psychiatric disorder so she could have an excuse to be lazy and over emotional (it’s not an excuse, I just feel emotions more intensely. Just means I need time to calm down and reassess.) 

She’s now recently tried to use this said psych disorder against me saying that I’m a twisted bitch, I’m obviously psychotic, that I just manipulate and use her son. I’ve gone NC, I can’t stand her but she’s been using my fertility issues as an attack and then when I start trying or going off she’ll call me these names to her son. I’m at a loss. My SO can’t go NC because he’s stuck there til he can get out of the lease. Any advice on how to deal with her til then?


Edit. Just so everyone knows I am reading all your comments &amp; applying them. I don’t want this post getting back to FMIL or her family as they’ve used these things plus a diary in about what happened to me as a child (all kinds of abuse) against me so I’m doing my best to just take in all advice. Thank you!"
609,"Shes horribly allergic to cats so shes opposed to us getting a cat when we get our own apartment. I think it's weird that this is such a huge concern for her when we can just visit them. Like shes planning on constantly being up in our business. 

Of course I am getting a cat anyway. One, because my fiance and I are more cat people, and two, because it's my version of being petty after she continuously chain smoked in the car with the windows barely cracked after telling her cig smoke makes me extremely nauseous during a trip.

I'm not looking for advice or anything, just wanted to share something amusing."
610,"Just a general check in to see if anyone else is NC and has post NC nightmares about their Just no? I was just woken by one.

For context, feel free to explore my other posts.

This is my dream:
For whatever reason we were in the vicinity of the in-laws. I had gone to take a nap. I woke up hours later and was getting dressed and over heard cultyculty and FIL trying to turn husband against me (Yes that part has happened for years but no this is a dream).

My kids were all standing out of view of them but listening and I stormed in and said 'right we've all heard you! We are leaving!' Then I drempt hubby's cousins *who are absolutely lovely and are no way involved * said ""hang on! Stop! "" and I said 'Do you know what your Aunt has done to me all these years' Then told them. The cousins were shook to hear and immediately believed me. *which yes, if they knew I do think they'd believe me 100% because of what they have seen from culty cow family and the way their Mothers have been treated *

I then knocked culty cow down and she shrivelled up. I can't explain it. 

It could be that I had coffee with another narcaccistic abuse survivor (she is 10 years NC ) yesterday and it dragged a lot up, but at the same time we were able to help each other. 

No I don't dream every night occasionally.

Just really wanting to know if anyone else has this or if it's common."
611,"Obligatory on mobile. 

So today my parents called me 6 times while I was sleeping. I have a 3 month old and a 2 year old. I’m perpetually exhausted! They have now resorted to also calling my bf while I’m day sleeping. So today my bf calls my parents back and we’re talking with my sometimes JustYesGreat Grandma. We’re joking making fun of the fact that I’m sleeping all the time. When my JNGM hops up in the conversation and starts calling me lazy. I don’t sleep much at night with a 4 month old &amp; sometimes I just get so exhausted I doze off for a bit. My 2 year old is a good kid and my house is child proof no worries really. He is still fed, changed, has water, plenty of toys and love. She says that me falling asleep is child abuse and that I will kill my child. She calls me an unfit mother and whatnot and threatens CPS for the last damn time! I snap at her and say because I’m up all day night with 2 children I’m lazy!? I’m busting my ass my daughter is ebf barely likes bottles and is attached to my hip. So yeah I basically am going NC with my JNGM. She has made it clear my whole life she doesn’t like me and I’m currently suffering through a panic induced mental break. I don’t need this shit. She has even disrespected me passive aggressively to my 2 year old. So this is the hill I will die on! I’m fucking done. My bf finally realized what I’ve been going through and believes me! He finally saw how she talks to me. Because like a true Nparent she hides her bs well. I feel vindicated! But also wildly angry. I can’t stick it out anymore because I just can’t take it. So it’s been a long time coming but well deserved NC with the wicked bitch of the west"
612,"T/W: Mention of mental health issues.


I’m a first time poster on Reddit in general so I’m a bit nervous but none of my family as far as I’m aware use reddit so here goes.

My parents has always been very controlling of each other and my sister (f14) and I (f18) such as having trackers on our phones and insisting we message them constantly when we’re out somewhere and they have followed me to places before using their tracker. 

Just under a year ago I met my SO(M18) who has helped me realise that their behaviour isn’t normal. He’s seen my mother send me lots of malicious messages and use my Chronic Fatigue syndrome against me in ways I didn’t realise until recently. 

My mother is the main controller of the household, she usually controls what’s happening in our home and is very manipulative towards me, she seems also to hold a lot of resentment towards my SO and my JYMIL (Who at this point I think cares about me more than my own mother does,) all she does while I’m home is say nasty things about them and she as well as my dad think my SO is the reason I have got severe anxiety and depression. I have had depression and anxiety before I was with my SO and thanks to him I have been able to get help and am improving more and more! I’m super grateful to him and my MIL for helping me pay for the counselling sessions! When my family found out they weren’t happy as they think the counsellor is incompetent as she was seeing my SO for separate issues, this isn’t the first time my mother has tried to sabotage me getting help for my mental health as in 2018 she had me removed from the CAHMs (Children’s mental health care NHS,) and called it a “waste of a referral.” I’m now seeing the Adult mental health services and am trying to their steps to wellbeing as well. They don’t know I’ve done this and I told the nurse that they don’t have permission to call my parents if they’re worried about me, I told them to contact me directly instead and my boyfriend only if they can’t get hold of me.

Another instance of them being quite mean is whenever I feel ill and have to have a day off college when they get home they proceed to tell me that “I’m going to fail the course based on attendance,” or “You’re going to get kicked off the course and not be able to go to Uni.” My aim is to get to University in order to get away from them, I’d only go an hour away but it’d be a baby step as Im still only 18 and feel attachment towards my room which is sometimes the only piece of actual space I get.

Are they really JustNos or am I being weird and judgmental?

*Edit: Spelling Error*"
613,"FIL married DH's stepmom about 10 years ago.  She seems OK but it's become evident that what she and her kids need come first, even if that means his children don't get to see him talk to him.

Siblings were raised by dad (bio mom didn't want primary).  When their dad remarried, all kids were adults and dad moved into house with wife, which is in the mountains.  Because of this, getting a hold of him can be hard enough (reception is crappy) but it always seems as if messages don't get through to him when we want to talk for help (he's a mechanic, we don't take advantage, we pay him for any work we need done, which is few an far between).  Her eldest has crashed his car multiple times (drinking) and FIL always steps up and does what is needed because his wife demands it.  She also volunteers him for projects neighbors need (reno, welding, mowing lawns, etc).

Two things have kind of been the final straw.  1. SIL lives out of state and doesn't come back very often.  When she was in town, FIL didn't come down from the mountains because Step BIL crashed his car again and instead of letting it sit for a day, Step MIL made FIL work on it so he didn't get to see daughter.  2.  Got married a week ago.  Found out bio mom was going to be there (DH hadn't seen her in over 7 years).  Forgot to inform FIL and Step MIL because weddings are fucking busy and we were also finishing house reno up to the last minute.  When she texted me the week of, she made a snarky comment about how she thought they'd be informed.  Day before wedding, she's asking about flowers for the wedding (who bothers the bride about that crap the day before?!).  When I informed her we had a boutonniere and bouquet made out of book pages, she said she'd get something made for FIL but she was sure whatever we had made for Bio Mom was probably lovely.  I finally snapped and said I didn't have time for your passive aggressiveness and that no flower was made for Bio Mom.  She back pedaled but PA and snarky comments are her bread and butter.

Really, I just need some help or advice.  In so many ways, I don't feel it's my place to say anything but I can see this woman has driven a wedge between FIL and his kids and it's gotten bigger over time (been with my partner for 9 years so I've been around long enough to see it grow).  SIL's husband and I talk about it and we don't want to overstep our boundary, so any idea what we can do as the in-laws to help our family?  I'm afraid too now that my husband is trying to reconnect with his bio-mom and Step MIL will start saying more things to FIL to poison the relationship."
614," Hello! I am new to this sub. I posted this in JustNoFamily because it slightly involves other family members but is mostly about her. Just a paragraph of other people. I thought maybe I could post it here and get some new thoughts into this and what I could do. Any thing that I should be doing. I have seen some of the spines you all have and I have to say you guys are amazing.  

If this doesn't belong here please let me know. Thought I would share the craziness.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I escaped an abusive situation a little more than a year ago. My mother would yell at me over really dumb things like making tomato soup because it was her ""favourite"" and her drug addicted nephew ate all the soup. I was withdrawing off klonopin by myself because my psychiatrist (this was after a study was released on how bad anti-anxiety medications are) didn't want to work with me anymore. My PCP was very understanding and said that I was doing the right thing by slowly tapering. It took 22 months to fully get off klonopin. (YAY! I did it!!!) I have not used any anti-anxiety medications for about 2 years now! I was put on klonopin as a form of control. My mother was upset that she could not control me as a teen because my own thoughts and opinion were not my own according to her. So she took me to get on this medication. She kicked me out at 16 because I was unruly and didn't respect or obey her. My dad didn't want to live with me so they made a deal that I would get on klonopin and go back to living with my mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any time I was telling the truth I was lying and when I would lie or tell her what she wanted to hear it was the truth. She told me I was a liar when I was a kid so I could not be trusted now. My mother was always really sweet in front of people but a demon when we were alone. No one believes me when I tell them how crazy and mean she is. A biological relative (Uncle/Aunt) has told me me that ""Your adoptive mother could never do those things.""(I do not know or want to speak to my biological parents. They are huge JustNo's from what I have heard.)

&amp;#x200B;

The abuse got worse when I was tapering. I had to tell my mom when I was cutting back and it had to be approved by her. When I was at the end of my taper I tapered(tapered without her approval) in December and she was mad at me for ruining ""HER holidays."" The entire time I was tapering it would be thrown in my face that she was supporting me and that I should be grateful to her because I was a freeloader. I offered to pay rent, but that was a no go because it was ""HER HOUSE"" and I had to obey her rules. I don't see how me paying rent would make it less of her house. I was vegan at the time and the food that I paid for would get eaten by everyone but me. Her reasoning was that it is her house and in her fridge she has a right to whatever was in her house. That unlike her gluten allergy that my veganism was a choice. My stomach gets really upset when I eat meat and I feel like I will be sick when consumed. Any food that she got that was special was her's and not to be touched by anyone. I offered to buy a mini fridge. (did not fly) I was told that what my father paid for child support was for room, food and board. So without my dad paying for me I wouldn't have had a place to stay? I was withdrawing off a klonopin which is said by doctors to be worse than heroin (I had lost my job and was unable to work) While I was withdrawing klonopin I was told that I had to cook and clean the entire house. If I didn't do it because of withdrawal I was threatened with eviction/yelled at for hours.

&amp;#x200B;

She then invited a heroin addict to live with us and when I protested I got the ol ""MY HOUSE!"" The nephew is a huge justNO and would make sexual comment that he thought was okay because I am adopted. He called me a succubus. He would lie on my lap and say that ""I looked like a woman."" I honestly thought he was going to harm me when I was asleep and my room wasn't allowed to be locked at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I would always get the MY HOUSE thing when ever did something against the ""rules"" or have an adult conversation.(Speak like adults over what is bothering us.) The calmer I was the more angry she would get. She never knocked on my door or gave me any privacy she would barge right in (anytime someone says my name while I am asleep I immediately bolt awake with my heartbeat slamming.) When we would talk she would go from being nice one second to screaming and yelling at me the next second. I was told that I was crazy, a liar, vindictive, a jr to my dad, (ex: Karl JR) She was living with the enemy. She would accuse me of recording her. I did it once for my therapist because they didn't believe what I was telling them. Any time a therapist would tell me something that my mother didn't like she would switch therapists. My mom required progress reports so they would tell her what was going on. She called my psychiatrist and my psychiatrist said ""I can help the patient but I cannot change the environment that she is in. That is up to you to fix yourself."" When I was told that by my psychiatrist I was like oh shit.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother would do this thing where she tries to get physical. She kicks the air at you if you are going down the stairs, or will punch the air and makes really dumb noises. Well, we had a fight that got so bad that she got up to actually punch me in the face. She asked what I was going to do after she punched me and I replied with call the cops. She stopped and did not punch me. *She only does the weird kicking thing if you are strong enough to fight back. She will hurt you if she thinks you can't fight back. She also thought that if I had a weapon in the house that I would kill her in the middle of the night. She told her nephew that he could not get a hunting bow because I would kill everyone. We laughed over it but I have taken archery classes and i understand that a bow is a weapon. You respect the tools you use for hunting. I would tell her all the time that I would not kill anyone because it is a waste and why would I want to spend life behind bars.*

&amp;#x200B;

 *She hurts my special needs sister all the time. Hitting her/pulling her hair when my sister disobeys. My mother did this to me for a long time until I fought back and slammed myself into a windowsill. I was 13 -15 at the time  My mother treated my sister and I like cinderella. My sister have Pervasive developmental disorder which doctors think she got from being beaten by our biological parents when she was a new born. My mother also refuses to medicate my sister. My sister could have been somewhat functioning if she was. Who knows. I love my sister.*

&amp;#x200B;

I will never forget when my sister asked me if I could teach her how to drive when she was old enough. I was a freshman in college. My sister(30f) is two years older than me(28f) and when she realised she would never drive she came up to me and said. ""You don't have to teach me how to drive. I can never drive."" I ran to my room and started bawling. It really isn't fair to her and I know she wishes that she was more like me. She has told me that she wants to be more like me. She can be really aware and articulate like she can speak a level about a 16 year old in certain situations and switches to mentality of a 5 year old. The brain is a confusing thing.

&amp;#x200B;

After physical violence was threatened I knew I was not safe. I contacted my amazing best friend and she let me stay with her family for a few months! I packed most of what I could along with my cat into my Nissan rogue and left New Jersey. I drove 3 hours when the week before I had just finished my taper from klonopin. I drove while withdrawing which is really dangerous. I was so scared leaving. I left when my mother was at work. I told my sister and my mother's nephew that I was going to my therapy session. I called my doctor and told her that I had to cancel the appointment that I had and that I was leaving NJ. My Fiance was amazed that I packed up and left. I was telling him for months that I was going to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother since at the time she still controlled my phone plan at the time demanded daily calls with at least 100+ texts a day because in her words that is what ""normal"" adults do with their parents. Well my at the time boyfriend(now fiance) said that I should move in with him in Canada. I was unsuccessful in getting a job in Massachusetts so i figured why not? I sold my car and got ready for a move. Since I have moved and changed my number I have been extremely low contact with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

*I* ***only*** *communicate with my mother through emails. She does not know where I live or my phone number which may change if the courts go through with the guardianship case for my sister. My mother ""forgot"" to apply for guardianship when my sister turned 18. She is doing it now. I have not given my number to the case worker and they stopped replying when I asked if I could get a PO box. Which I thought was super suspicious.* Can anyone let me know if that is normal? Or should I assume that this was a ploy to gain my contact information. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Present day:** Here is where the issue comes in. I left some of my things at my mothers. Things that I shouldn't care about but she knew that I wanted to get like clothes and other sentimental things. For example my grandfathers(Dad's father) ashes and my coin collection(all USA special quarters. My Grandpa shared with me the joy of coin collecting). She is holding all of my things hostage. My dad who lives quite close to my mother said that he would get my things but when he went the first time my mother gave my dad 5 boxes of trash(there are 5 remaining bags of things.) Empty boxes, old medications, pens, things that no one wants. My dad is/was furious. Well, she emailed me saying that I need to look at getting my things because she wants them out. In the email she said that I can take what is left of my plushies and other belongings. I asked her what she meant by when she said what was left. She then told me that she has been giving away my plushies and when I asked if she could get them back she said no because she was giving my things to children and she refuses to take away childrens toy. I was like well this sucks and could you tell me which ones. I was emailed ""I am a 66 year old woman. You are lucky that I even bagged your items. You should be grateful.""  *I collect stuffed animals. These were mint condition plushies, like cactuar, Hello Kitty and chocobo.*

&amp;#x200B;

In another email her reasoning for doing this is because ""I am the one that left without telling her anything and left them there. That because she can't see me that I don't deserve my things and she will make it hard for my dad to get all my things."" My fiance says that as soon as my PR status is solidified that I can go back to the states and get my things and he will go with me. My dad is currently mad at me over all this hubbub and is not talking to me. My dad can barely walk due to a hip replacement gone bad. He has lost his job because of the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to see if I can get a storage unit while abroad so my dad can at least get my things/hire a few friends to help and deposit them. I get that I should not care about my things they can be replaced. I have been dealing with recurrent kidney infections and other health issues which relates to black mold exposure. I have learned to not let health issues go untreated because it will just spiral out of control. Before I left I found out that my room/prison was contaminated with black mold and my eye issues among respiratory issues are from being exposed to black mold for years. I have reached out to the people who have gotten some of my plushies and made them aware that all my things are contaminated. I want to get rid of my things myself. I don't want my mother to do it for me. I feel like a am whining way too much right now and I apologise. I am so scared to see my mother again. I have nightmares involving me being back at her house. The worse that happened was when I woke up one day and thought that I was in my old prison. I have no idea what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also really worried about my special needs sister. My mother is physically abusive to my sister because she cannot fight back. My mother is also anti-vax and anti-antibiotic/modern medicine which got worse when I got CA-MRSA. She boasts about how she heals bacterial infections with garlic. Any time I was sick with a bacterial infection (like a kidney infection or an ear infection) my mother would yell at me for taking antibiotics. I was told to take garlic and put apple cider vinegar in my ears.(i complained that my ear was hurting) I destroyed my ears because I wanted to make her happy. She wanted to treat the MRSA with GARLIC because the vikings did it?...I took the antibiotic and the garlic/did garlic baths. My mother was not happy. She has not taken my sister to the doctors when she had strep throat because she swore it was viral. It was not viral and the doctor said that if he didn't know my mother that he would have called CPS on her. My sister's strep was super bad and she had it for months. She got this weird thing called ASEA and gave it to my sister because it was a ""cure all; can cure Autism and other special needs disorders."" She made me drink it. ASEA is salt water. She had no qualms with putting me on klonopin because she wanted a doll. Not a person. modern medicine is only for her needs.

&amp;#x200B;

I cry a lot over what is going on. I feel guilty over my sister, I had to leave my childhood dog behind. I feel horrible that my dad has to deal with my mother. My mother doesn't believe that lilies/chocolate are poisonous to animals cause animals wont eat what is poisonous. My cat is still thankfully alive(after many vet visits She got IBD from the ordeal.) The lilies almost killed my cat. My cat(Maia) is now a completely different cat. She cuddles with me every day, she is happy and has a brother(Martin, fiance's cat) who bullies her a bit. She loves my fiance and is really warming up to him.

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes wonder if she was right and I am the JustNo. I feel lousy and guilty all the time. I see things and go oh my mother would love that. Is this reaction normal when you first go NC? How do you deal with the metaphorical loss of my mother? How do I get over the lifetime of hurt from her anti-modern medicine. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My mother is trying to control me through the last of my things and has given my dad a hard time as he can barely walk. She gave my bag 5 boxes of trash and there are 5 bag's left. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I apologise if this is all over the place. This is the first time I am writing this all down.**  


Has anyone else dealt with this type of crazy? How did you deal with it. I am trying to learn as much as I can because my dad does want me to try and get my grandpa's ashes back. They are his dad's ashes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth it to write he an email detailing why I do not want to speak with her or should I just let her wonder? I have been trying to reintroduce myself back into my mother's side of the family but they are all kinda crazy JustNo's. Basically I want them to know I am alive because my mother slandered my Fiance to everyone she knows. Even my friends. They were told that my fiance was grooming me and a predator and that he was going to sell me into the sex trade. We have a sizable age gap. My fiance wasn't looking for someone who was super young(he is not someone who dates based on age that is creepy and I would not be with him if he did.) or anyone at all. We met playing WOW. His friends all thought that I was in my late 30's."
615,"You may have read my other posts about my FMILs attempts to weasel her way into our house before we even moved in. I hoped my lady post would be the end of it, but here we are again, gentle readers. 

Many of you here on r/JUSTNOMIL mentioned that this probably wouldn't be the end of my MIL's antics in trying to barge her way into our new house before it was ready, and guys- get ready for this:
She used a funeral as an in to ask to come to our house.
So Friday, FH and I were out and about, picking up a few things for the house along with last minute dinner goodies. We were flying on the high of the upcoming weekend to finally get some patching done since the electrical in the house was sewn up.
We had just pulled into the driveway when FH's brow furrowed and he fished his phone out of his pocket. I managed to sneak a glance at his screen to see the word ""mom"" before I abruptly felt the dread of 1,000 dementors.
Being the good boy he is, he immediately called her back as I stared listlessly out the window.
Pleasantries were exchanged before she began to prod and ask what we were doing this weekend. He ran through the laundry list of little projects before she mentioned casually that she was at her friend's house.
Ya'll.
Her friend lives not 15 minutes away from us and I immediately whipped my head around to glare at the side of FH's face.
She never goes to visit said friend. This happens maybe once every five years or so. On top of that, she rarely travels unless it's to a Chinese restaurant, a Christmas store, or one of her other son's houses. FH echoed my thoughts and asked if anything was going on. She went into a tangent about a long lost cousin's recent passing and that she was up to attend the funeral. I felt briefly bad for jumping to conclusions, until my intuition proved to be correct. The very next breath was this:
""Would you mind if I stayed one night with you so I wouldn't be imposing on Karen?""
I put my hand on FH's arm and stared deep down into his soul. He knew the future of his favorite Friday meal was on his mind. I didn't even bother to lower my voice and blurted out ""No. Absolutely not.""
FMIL, having heard that I was in the car as well backpedaled then and pretended that she didn't really mean it and that she could stay with his cousin- and that that was the plan all along. I could feel my blood boiling as he repeated the same reasons we weren't going to have guests until the first weekend of November. I don't want to sound like an absolute bitch but I couldn't help feeling like she used the cousin's death as another way to ask to come see the house by garnering sympathy/ guilt-tripping.
Guys, I don't get it. It's like no is not in her vocabulary. While I appreciate that FH has been firm, I'm getting a little tired of this constant boundary pushing. How many different ways can we say no?
Jesus.

Needless to say I finished unpacking the kitchen, got drunk and slept in a sea of boxes that night in peace.

**edit, removed names **"
616,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeutic at this point in time. 

This one is a short one tonight, but I'm exhausted. It's typical TPP though. 

When I was 13, we (I lived with TPP, my stepdad, and my brother at the time) moved into a new house. It had just two bedrooms and  a bathroom upstairs, so that was of course where my brother and I stayed. It was a wonderfully old house and had a claw foot tub. I loved the claw foot tub, as long, hot baths with a good book was an escape for me (and still is). 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 2 years younger, and somewhat lazy. He doesn't enjoy doing anything out doors, and his main goal in life back then was to play ALL the video games and Pokeman, Yu Gi Oh, etc. Well, somewhere in there he'd decided the 10 steps to the upstairs bathroom was too far so if I was in there, the 35 steps to the second bathroom downstairs was WAY too far. He began peeing in bottles and stashing them under his bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP found this one day (she cleaned his room monthly). It was INSTANTLY my fault. Even though there were 5 dozen bottles of pee under his bed, and there's no freaking way I could have been in the bathroom EVERY single time he had to pee, in that past 30 days, seeing as I was on the dance team at school, took 3 times a week ballet, tap and jazz, competition dance team, yearbook staff, and had friends. I wasn't spending all my time after school at home, that was for sure, much less holed up in the bathroom. Well, the doorknob was removed from the bathroom and now, we had to announce every time we were going in the bathroom because she timed us. 5 minutes for pottying, 15 minutes for bathing. She had a timer. It was degrading, and humiliating, and took away my ""safe place"". Not to mention I have PCOS and endometriosis so sometimes 5 minutes to potty is HARD to force. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around the same time she accused me of being sexually active because I shaved down ""there"" (again, horrible monthly problems with clots and the like, so shaved was easier, plus with me in leotards and tights for dance, it was much better), and I started using tampons. Um, no. I started using tampons because of the no panties under your dance uniform policy. TPP didn't believe me. I must have been getting some at 13 years old because that's the only way a tampon would fit. Ok, cool. So, TPP started requiring that I NEVER TOUCH THE TRASH in my bathroom. She'd check and count my tampons/pads. If it got taken to the trash I got my phone taken. Because, she NEEDED to know I wasn't pregnant. Cool, TPP. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was 6ish months later I moved in with my dad (I wrote about that in a past post). I had my own bathroom, no one timed me, and no one counted my sanitary products. Life was MUCH easier, until I had to go visit TPP. (She also has posted EVERYWHERE that my vagina stinks -what?- and it's because I take too many hot baths and have too much sex. Cool, TPP.) 

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm off to enjoy a hot bath, at the ripe old age of 28. Sound the alarms)."
617,"My spouse and I fight about my MIL all the time. 
At this point, if we get divorced, it will be because of her. 
Should we try to save our marriage by cutting her out of our lives?"
618,"Some of y’all may have read my previous posts. I would recommend reading then if you haven’t already but the gist is.. There was a straw and it broke the camel’s back. My JNMIL invited herself over on my birthday, we told her TWICE to please not come over and that we would make time to see her another day. She came over regardless and, naturally, couldn’t believe that she wasn’t met with open arms. Things. Blew. Up.
Fast forward to a few days ago.. DH’s cousin was having a birthday party (a milestone age) we didn’t attend for multiple reasons (We have a baby and this was at night with alcohol, we aren’t close with his family and because we didn’t want this drama to impact cousin’s night.) DH met up with his brother and heard ALL about it though! BIL mentioned that all of DH’s aunts and uncles thought that it was “such a shame” that we couldn’t make it. Translation: JNMIL has told them whatever her story is and they needed to make a comment while looking like wonderful people (Pretty standard for this family.) BUT THE HIGHLIGHT, according to BIL was.. JNMIL makes her way over to him and without saying “hello”, “how are you”, “good to see you” JNMIL pulls him into a hug while loudly declaring “WE’VE LOST HIM! WE’VE LOST HIM!”
What. The. Frick?!?!

Edit: JNMIL has seen BIL since the shiz hit the fan but this was the first time that they were around other family members together."
619,"So I was scheduled for my annual gynecologist appointment. My gynecologist is a male, as I’m not comfortable with another female examining my private parts. He’s an amazing doctor and my old-fashioned MIL doesn’t understand it. All she cares for is the fact that he’s a man who definitely must be a pervert to choose such a profession. She has tried to step me up with her female gynecologist to what I was very firm– absolutely not. I understand that the majority of women probably choose female gynecologists, that’s not the case with me.

This morning I arrive at the clinic only to find out I’m not scheduled. I was unpleasantly surprised and started to question the desk person, telling them that I called and scheduled my appointment months ago. They explained to me that I called yesterday and canceled my appointment. 

I was like – what? I see a gynecologist every year, why would I cancel my appointment? My doctor has many patients, so I called and booked my appointment back in August already and now I cannot get to him and have to wait 2-3 more months because suddenly I’m not scheduled.

Turns out, it was MIL who called, pretended to be me and canceled my appointment. When I confronted her, she was like ”See how smart I am! You have no business going to that lewd, pervert man. We, women, need to see women doctors unless we’re shameless sluts whose purpose for going isn’t really a medical one.”  

Well, thank you MIL, you have done me a ”great” favor. There were some pretty important things I wanted to talk about with my doctor. I’ll try to call him, as I have his private number, maybe he can somehow find time for me. If not, I’ll have to wait till December at least."
620,"My first post here but have lurked for a while now! Any weirdness is cause I'm on mobile! Omg having all the feels RN.

To put it simply, I've had a wild ride when it comes to my MIL. She is an incredibly selfish and oblivious person who never thinks before she speaks. She isn't mentally ill, she is just a selfish b*tch. Only relevant history here is that for 4 to 5 years, I was her only point of contact when it came to updates on our family. My D(Dear)H couldn't have cared less (I should have done the same, but hindsight and all that).

2017 it all came to a head. I went NC and slowly (with the help of D(dear)H who knows how to keep her under wraps) put our two young DC into NC as well. Which actually wasn't that hard to do, as she is selfish and had better things to do than establish any kind of relationship with her grandchildren once I stopped facilitating. 

After unfortunately having to see her for a family wedding in June, I was finally comfortably settling into a life without her nonsense, as DH was successfully Grey Rocking the shit out of her and my anxiety and the fear of seeing her calmed the eff down. 

Nek minnit, after radio silence since her ""apology"" text a year ago that I ignored due to it's lack of an actual apology, I get a text this afternoon.

""Hey Kaleela, How you guys going?"" 

YESSSSSS BITCH! I bent over backwards keeping her informed, I cut her off and despite her sporadic efforts to get info out of DH AND FAILING, she finally comes to me. KARMA IS A BIATCH. 

I can't explain why I feel so giddy. This woman tore me down, abandoned any semblance of a relationship with her Son and his children, insulted me as a person and a mother and tried to explain away her behaviour with bullshit statements like ""I have a right to an opinion"" ""you are young"" ""I've raised wonderful children"" ""you need anger management"" and the like. It makes my chest just glow now knowing that she felt the need to message ME because DH was Grey Rocking her. 

Oh sweet just desserts."
621,"Hi! Just found this sub after posting about my MIL experience in r/pregnant! I think this fits and over been relating hard to all these post! So my story:

My MIL asked if i was having a baby shower. This is my second baby, and i have plenty of stuff left over...and i don't like parties, so the answer is NO. She insists i have atleast a ""sprinkle"". No thank you, i'm good. Proceeds to insist... ""You don't have to do anything"" ""it'll be casual"" yadda yadda. So I say fine, if you want to take it on, i'll show up! She asks my BFF to invite people so it's basically my close group of 5 friends, tells them its at MY HOUSE, decides a date that works for her, plans it around a football game not my schedule, not my 19 month old's bedtime or nap time, tells them its a pot luck so they are providing food (not her... ), she has no plans for it, no decoration, is planning on getting there after the game (so will be late), and i am stuck cleaning my house... for my party... that i didn't want to have. I am 36 weeks, and very sore, stressed and tired. 

Well I went through with the party today! She asked if I had any cravings she'd like me to bring. Yes. Donuts and apple cider!! She shows up with fried chicken. And cupcakes. My DH eventually asks where the cider is and tells his sister to go get some (im 36 weeks preggo and was looking forward to some damn cider! Literally my only request!) Party was awkward, she chimed in on every convo, called my baby 'DH Jr' even though she knows his real name, brought her laptop and was on FB the while time. No decorations, no party plans, shows up braless in her football shirt she made, complained about my mom (who was on vacation and who MIL didnt take into consideration at all) and ya'll.... SHE TOOK HOME THE CIDER AND CUPCAKES!!!!! Didnt ask. Just left with any food she brought. The ciderrrrrrr."
622,"This is going to be long and kind of all over the place, so I’m apologizing in advance and thanking any one who reads this mess and tries to make sense of it. I’m gonna start off with non-kid related stuff, but I’ll get around to the kid thing, I swear.

I also want to preface this with the fact that I feel like a lot of the things that bother me about my mom recently are BEC because I spent SOOOO much time with her that it was exhausting. I’m grateful to have a mom who would do anything for me, and she’s wonderful, but she’s a worrier and sensitive and takes everything personally. She feels everything very very very deeply. So when she’s upset, it’s waterfalls. When she’s happy, she’s giddy and excitable and won’t shut up. It can be a lot at times.

I love my mom dearly. She’s always been supportive, has never made me feel self conscious, always raised us to be able to trust her (“I would prefer you don’t drink, but if you do and need a ride home, I don’t care if it’s 2 am and you’re an hour away, I will get you, no questions asked”, that kind of stuff). My parents raised three of my cousins as well as me and my brother because their parents either died or were unable to care for them. Almost raised another one, too. They’re great parents, truly.

But lately, my mom is making me nervous. We’re all adults now, my oldest brother being 29, I’m 26, and my youngest brother (/cousin) is 21.

A few years ago, my oldest brother had a horrible accident and was in the hospital for two months. And she was really supportive. To the point where it became overbearing to him. She was there almost every single day and tried to make sure someone was there whenever she wasn’t. He was 24 at the time.  He tried to tell her he could go a day or at least a few hours without a visitor, but she was obsessed with making sure someone was always there. Not the worst thing in the world. It feels weird to complain about a parent caring too much, but you could tell it would get to him. So when I would visit, he’d complain to me and me and our cousins would cut our visits shorter so he could have time to himself.

Then about 6 months ago, I was in the hospital for an extended period of time (75 days total over 3 and a half months, yayyyyy bone marrow failure). Same exact situation. Caring to the point of being overbearing. My husband and I live about an hour away from the hospital I was in, and he works about 2 hours away from the hospital. So him visiting was difficult, but he visited at least 3 or 4 times a week. Even though it meant four hours of driving on top of a full work day and taking care of our cats and doing all household chores. Meanwhile, my parents live a half hour from the hospital and my mom works 20 minutes from it. So she was there ALL. THE. TIME. And when she couldn’t come, she would send another member of my family, or make sure my husband was coming. And she’d get upset with him if he went more than a day without visiting even though she knew how difficult it was for him to do so. I only ever went one day without a visitor that I remember, and that was because she was going to send my grandmom and the room I was in didn’t have comfy chairs and I’d be sleeping all day anyway. Again, feels like a silly thing to complain about, but sometimes I just wanted time to myself, and she pretty much refused. 

Other examples of weird behavior: 1) At one point, I had a couple days where I wasn’t eating much, and after that I had to send her pictures of my empty breakfast plate every day or she’d get upset. It was exhausting. 2) One time, one of my friends was supposed to visit, so my mom went to work. My friend woke up with a sore throat that day and my immune system was shit so she said she should probably stay home. Fine, no biggie. Thank you for taking my health into consideration. My mom was so upset by this. And she loves this friend. We’ve been friends for like, 15 years, and my mom has never had an issue with her. But when my mom came later that day after work, I could hear how angry she was. It was ridiculous. God forbid I was alone for a few hours.

She was (and still is) more upset about everything going on with me than I was. I feel bad saying this, but it was honestly irritating. Serious question: am I an asshole for that?

So that’s how my mom is. She would do anything for her kids. Anything except back off even the tiniest bit. And if I try to give myself some space, she thinks I’m mad at her and gets upset and then I feel guilty. So that’s a cycle that I need to figure out how to break. But whatever. Moving on.

Anyway. Kids. So my cousin had a baby a couple years ago, the first baby in our family in like, 10 years. And between my mom and my grandmom, my cousin was hounded every day “We need a picture today of [baby]!!” And they bragged to me about it like “OH yeah, we make sure [cousin] sends us a picture every single day!” And I was like “...Cool....” Well then the baby passed away from SIDS. About a year after he passed, my cousin had another baby, and naturally, my mom and grandmom were even more obsessed. “You didn’t send a picture yesterday so we get extra today!” Calling her “their baby,” etc. Stuff that would drive me absolutely batshit if it were my kid.

And when I was in the hospital, my mom and I got to talking about baby names at one point and I told her a name that I recently started liking (even though we’re definitely waiting a bit to have kids, and she knows that, especially after my bone marrow transplant). And she was just like “No way. Maybe as a middle name, but definitely not a first name.” Like.. ???? I might not even be able to have kids after the chemo, and if I can, it’s gonna be a while, and I told her the names my husband and I have been set on before I brought up that name. Then I just casually mentioned a name that had been starting to grow on me and she immediately shot it down as if she has a say.

All of these combined... How she was when we were in the hospital, her obsessive need for DAILY pictures of her great nephew and niece, and her shutdown of a name that she has no business picking.. I’m nervous to see what she’s like when I have kids. If I can have kids (or even if we adopt), I’ll likely be the first of my siblings to have kids, so I feel like that’ll just make it even worse.

It’s a ways away, but I’m out of work on disability so this is what I get to think about during the day. Hahaha.

Any advice on how to draw boundaries now and prepare for what’s to come?

TIA!"
623,"Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub, but I could post literally once a week. My husband’s family is nothing but drama that always seeps into (&amp; sometimes ruins) our lives. But onto my issue. It’s a long one, so please be patient &amp; thank you in advance for your advice. ❤️

Some backstory, I’m a SAHM, 3 kids, my youngest is now 2 years old. For the last year my MIL has been watching my kids one day a week while I was in school. I’d take my 2yo to her after dropping the other 2 off at school, then she’d pick the kids up from school, take them to her place, do homework etc, I’d pick up the 2yo &amp; the other 2 spend the night so she could take them to school for me the next day. Sounds nice, but my in law’s are pushing 70 &amp; have 2/4 of their adult children still living with them. it’s been a world of headache &amp; drama, but I need that one day so I put up with it. Hubby works &amp; is finishing school too, so he’s kind of useless until next May &amp; I have no family of my own aside from my mom who is another JNMIL that lives with us &amp; is essentially a 4th child, but that’s not the story for right now. 

Anyway, a new school year has started. I decided to put my schooling on hold until my husband wraps up his last year of school because I have way too much on plate. MIL keeps the kids anyway so I can still have my day off. It’s barely been 2 months that they’ve been back in school, so like 6-7 sleepovers at this point, but week after week my kids have come home complaining about it. The biggest issue has been that my SIL (25yo) lately has been refusing to give up her bed for the night, so once they slept on the floor &amp; twice on the couch. MIL laughed &amp; said we were overreacting that it was fun to have sleepovers on the floor like “her kids did”, but that was on weekends &amp; during summer, not when they had school the next day. Hubs always takes the lead on dealing with his family (I literally cannot do it, I would murder someone, I have ZERO patience for them) &amp; sometimes he doesn’t always approach it with the “rage” I need him to, but with this one he did. He was livid about it, so SIL has been sleeping at the my other SIL’s (35yo) those nights... except, my other SIL is moving back in Nov. 1, so that’s no longer an option. When she moves back in she’s bringing her 2 giant American Bulldogs with her. Now, my BIL (30yo) &amp; SIL already have 2 American Bulldogs that live there. The dogs are all related, BIL has the dad, SILs have the children. With the exception of my BIL’s dog, all the dogs are basically feral. No training, live out doors to do whatever they want. Recently my MIL has made SIL bring her dog inside too because she wants her yard back. I hate these dogs. I know it’s not their fault, but they are gross. They get like the minimum amount of care to keep them alive, so it’s not like I can call animal services or anything. The dogs have always been mostly “put away” when we’re there so it hasn’t been an issue until now, but with SIL moving in I’m even more concerned. 2 of the dogs cannot be together. They fight &amp; attack each other. My SIL was going to rehome one of her dogs to avoid that, but FIL is refusing to let her. The dogs have moved in ahead of her, so they aren’t in the way as she packs &amp; whatnot. We visited Friday night &amp; already the 2 dogs crossed paths. OMy 6yo daughter was trying to go into a room to get some shoes she left &amp; the dog pushed passed her &amp; got out while the other was eating &amp; they got into it. Hubs &amp; BIL were able to break them up, but not before one of the dogs ended up with a huge gash in his neck. obviously it got me worried. My BIL’s dog being the only one who’s trained is often allowed to roam the house. My 2yo son loves this dog. He always plays with the dog when he’s out. I’m terrified that the other dog is going to get out &amp; my son is going to get caught in the middle &amp; hurt. That’s a very valid concern IMO. 

So, I decided I don’t want my kids over there without us anymore. My husband is torn because of course he doesn’t want to put the kids in harms way, but he starts a new job Nov. 4 &amp; will literally be gone 6/7 days a week, where as now it’s every morning &amp; 4/7 nights. He feels helpless because he wants to help more, but until he finishes school we’re pretty much stuck so he keeps insisting that I do still need that day without the kids. Obviously, I want that day off too. It’s been an extremely difficult year &amp; having one day off a week to decompress, run errands without children, study, take a decent shower, etc is like a dream.

All of my husband’s siblings can take care of themselves, they’re working adults for crying out loud. But moving back in with mom &amp; dad comes with the added bonus that not just rent, but ALL of their bills get taken care of. Hubs &amp; I have bills too on top of kids, do you think we get any help? We recently had to unenroll our kids from all their extracurriculars as we prepare for my husband’s new job, which comes with a slight paycut for 6 months &amp; when we asked them to pitch in for that, “they couldn’t afford it”. So I’m angry that my in law’s are putting their children’s well-being over that of their grandchildren. 

I had mentioned not feeling okay with the kids there anymore Friday while we were there, but I guess she thought I was bluffing. She called &amp; was like “Hey. Everything okay? You’re late today”. When I explained our position of the dogs again she said “they have a system” not WE or I have system, but THEY, my siblings-in-law, the people who can barely take care of themselves, let alone their animals. When I told her that systems aren’t foolproof &amp; anything can happen she hung up on me. Now she thinks I’m keeping her from her grandchildren, because of course her son doesn’t feel this way on his own, I put him up to it. 

So, am I wrong? I know pets can be a sensitive subject for a lot of people, “they’re part of the family” &amp; whatnot. Anyone found themselves in a similar position with other family members’ pets? Also, the bed situation, none of the adult children want to give up theirs rooms anymore. My kids are in school &amp; need a good night’s rest. What would you do, y’all? Hubby’s training for the new job starts today through Friday &amp; then he works doubles Saturday &amp; Sunday at his old job, so I’m pretty much on my own with this until next Monday with no one to be a sounding board. (Although, I guess it feels silly, I’m fairly certain I’m making the right choice, as much as I’ll miss my 12 hours of weekly freedom)

Edit: someone commented about how I expect my siblings in laws to give up their beds. I only expect this a) because my MIL told them to as a condition of my kids sleeping over to begin with &amp; b) the family is huge, MIL has 8 siblings &amp; they each have 3-4 kids. people have been constantly sleeping over their whole lives &amp; continue to this day &amp; no one complains about giving up a bed then. 

TLDR: you should read it for more context, but basically my MIL watches the kids once a week, &amp; now I’m scared for their safety because of 4 large dogs, 2 of which fight."

The title is kind of straight to the point. But basically I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. He is bipolar and sometimes has episodes. Well recently he recently moved into an expensive apartment with someone back in June and had hated it, and hated living with him since week 1. His roommate is disrespectful to me and my boyfriend and other people around him and it frustrated and annoyed my boyfriend to the point to where he just shut himself off in his room. It’s been like that for months. And doing this has sparked his anxiety to the point to where he can hardly go to work or even out in public. Currently he’s on short term leave due to his anxiety and bipolar.  

this whole time i have been nothing but supportive and everyday he tells me how thankful he is that i am supportive of him and how he appreciates how much I’ve tried to help. We don’t argue, we actually get along great and are both happy with each other. 

Well here is where is mom comes in. The other day she called me worried about her son and just wanted to know how he was. And i told her he was doing better, with less panic attacks and that Ive been trying to help him out with any daily stresses he has. She asked me if he was going to leave the apartment due to his roommate and end up moving in with me and i said most likely, we’ve talked about that option recently. And she proceeds to completely lose her shit and yell at me saying it’s too early in the relationship, and that her son shouldn’t be moving in with me and that she thinks I’m trying to control her son, that I’m toxic and that I’m going to be the reason her son kills himself. (His dad was bipolar and killer himself when my boyfriend was younger) she explained that his dad got involved with a toxic woman and she was the reason he killed himself and that I’m just like that woman and her son is going to follow in his dads footsteps because of me basically. 

It hurt that she said this. I haven’t told my boyfriend that she called me and said this. My boyfriend and i don’t fight, we get along and he’s admitted that his roommate and his living situations are the main start of this. I’ve been supportive of my boyfriend and I’ve tried to help him in every way. I’ve always gotten along with his mom up until that day, and i have no idea why she flipped on me like that. 

Should i tell my boyfriend about the phone call? Would that be too much for him to hear? Would it start an argument to where he thinks I’m trying to make him turn against his mom? I don’t know what to do.

(Sorry for the long post)"
625,"To paint the picture:

Yea, we get back from vacation, DD was in daycare for 2 days and threw up in the evening, repeatedly. For a toddler, that's serious. And as she even threw up the little milk and water we get into her and was getting too quiet for my liking, we drove her at 1am to the emergency room of the children's hospital. There, she continued to eject everything out and was put on an IV. An IV on a toddler looks so cruel, even though I know it's probably saving her life by rehydrating her. I stayed with DD while so had to go home on the first train in the morning (5am) once we were move to the isolation ward for stomach bugs. I was tired, awake for almost a whole 24h and reduced to silently rocking DD since I can't breast feed her in fear she will throw up again and crying from all of it. 

That was when I so wished I could just phone my mother up and have her tell me all will be fine. DD is going to be fine. Or she coming here, take care of DD for a few hours while I catching a bit of sleep (I was functioning on less than 5hours sleep a day, divided into small chunks less than 1h each). I also knew she would not do that. I could hear her voice in my head, how she would berate me for driving DD to the hospital. She is a firm believer in babymassages, the kind that will heal all illnesses. And once a baby is on IV or any modern medicine, the massages will loose effect. (Quote MS). She also would blame us, since DD getting sick would be clearly our fault. 

Now, this was not my imagination or what ever. DD once got fever when we where visiting my parents. She was quite small then and they went into a panic. Ranting on about how we would drag DD everywhere, (except driving to them apparently, that should have happened ages ago) and how we are risking her health. But, refused to let us drive to the hospital, since it's only a fever at 37.5°C. They wanted to rub her (I think I once mentioned this) in alcohol to cool her. We adamantly refused. When her fever got to 38°C, I called the night service of the local physicians. They told me not to panic and it sounds like the normal 3day fever and to watch DD. If the fever gets higher to 40°C, we should go to the ER. In the meantime, we could try paracetamol. In the short time of that phonecall, MS managed to wrestle DD from SO, who was sleep deprived, and vanished upstairs. When I found them, they were rubbing her with something and got really angry when we sniffed the liquid to confirm that it was indeed water. When the fever dropped, it was of course because they rubbed her and massaged her, not because of the medicine or she was over it. 

So now, sometime during that whole thing, she wanted us to just leave DD to them and go to sleep. I wouldn't be surprised if she told the same thing to my SIL, mother of my nephew, when he was ill. But, when he once caught another cold, alongside with SIL, and SIL left him with MS, MS would not stop complaining that SIL just burdened MS with an ill child and how irresponsible she was. 

I was reminded of this whole thing again when SO sent me a video about double bind no win situation with narcissts from TheraminTrees. I'm working through his videos right now. Shocking how much of the handled treats are reminding me of my mother.

So I don't know what I wanted with this post. Maybe a little rant and get it out of my system.

Thanks for listening / reading."
626,"I'm really upset right now, so excuse me if this comes out a little jumbled or anything. We've been NC with my JNMIL since we got married 7 years ago. She came to our wedding, threw a hissy fit the entire time, and then we refused to speak to her again, not even when we had our son, though my husband did call to tell her that if she showed up to my SIL's funeral (her DIL she never met), then she would be escorted out, but that's a complete story all on it's own.

JNMIL is very controlling, a narcissist, and an alcoholic. Has been my husband's entire life. She used to just constantly get drunk on boxed wine but eventually moved on to hard liquor by the time we got married, and she made so many horrible comments towards us (like that my DH had ruined her life and her marriage, and that I had ballooned up and got really fat and wasn't pretty anymore). The ballooning up comment was my husband's last straw, especially when he found out she was telling people my serious chronic illness was being faked to get sympathy.

Well, she called both my DH and my BIL tonight, the two children that refuse to have anything to do with her, and she said in her voicemail that she is dying, and she doesn't understand why he won't speak to her anymore. And now my DH is feeling guilty and upset, and is torn as to what to do. Meanwhile I'm sitting there thinking there's no way she isn't aware of what led to this, she's just decided that it isn't her responsibility and that she did nothing wrong; it was obviously all me poisoning him against her!

And now I'm really upset because I don't know what he is going to do. I do know that if he contacts her, my son is being kept out of it, as is my currently baking daughter. She said she didn't want anything to do with our ""spawn"" anyway, so she doesn't get to gain that just because she is supposedly dying of cancer. 

After all of these horrible things she has done over the years, she thinks she just gets to say she is dying and we have to run to her side and fix it all for her and pretend nothing happened. I fucking refuse."
627,"So, I have to preface this with a little bit of background.

My ex, his sister, and one of his brothers was taken away and given to the state when my ex was 2 years old. His other brother was doing stuff he shouldntve with his sister, and when my ex's Bio Mom was given the choice between 3 of her children or one child, she chose the 1 child. The 3 were adopted in 2006. Sister, and Brother have nothing to do with BioMom or BioGma.

I gave birth to my son in June 2018. BioMom demanded pictures of him, and wanted to meet him. Luckily at the time she lived in Colorado.

Me, my ex, and my mom got a place together back in April. My mom didnt stay long. My ex and I broke up about 3 months ago, and I left to move back in with my parents not too long after. My ex has been paying rent just fine on his own. The lady who comes and collects rent told him he doesn't make enough to live there and he has to find a roommate, or move.

My ex quit his job last week because they were going to fire him anyway. He's applying for new jobs, but neither of us are sure he'll be able to get one before rent is due. This is where BioMom and BioGma come in.

His BioMom wants him to move up north to live with her and BioGma. This is a 6 hour drive, one way. Approx. $120 in gas to drive there. She said she would pay for his car to be fixed, help him get a driver's liscence, and pay for him to go to driving school again. He doesn't want to move up there.

My mom talked to his BioGma and she mentioned that her and BioMom would be willing to pay his rent for him to stay down here, because he has a son to take care of. BioMom doesnt seem to have that has an option. She wants him up there.

I told my ex today when I took our son to see him that if he moves up there, she won't let him leave. All she wants is him and his siblings back her life and she will do anything to get them. She doesn't seem to care that he has a son down here, and doesn't even believe anything he tells her when it's all true.

I never liked his BioMom. She always rubbed me the wrong way, feeling entitled to pictures of my son after only being back in my ex's life for 2 months at the time. His BioGma knows how she is, but also has enough sense to know that he has a child that needs a father.

He wants me to talk to his BioMom, try and talk some sense into her, tell her I don't want him to move up there. I don't want to talk to her, and I refuse to.

Not my circus, not my monkeys."
628,"My mom has her just yes moments but ever since I turned 18 she’s been just no and freaking out about me leaving our FAMILYYYYYY. I cut her some slack because she’s been a lot nicer recently so I went out with her to dinner last night with my jydad and my SO. We had a good dinner, and I ended up going back to her house to see my siblings. 

She runs a photography business and couldn’t stop gushing about how happy she was one of her clients gave birth and how she has baby rabies and she can’t wait til I have one. I’m literally still 18 and a freshman in college.  I said that won’t be a while and she accepted that, but not before making some very just no comments. 

She said that when I have a baby she is going to take it from me and not give it back “once she gets her hands on it” I told her if that’s the case she won’t be seeing my kids at all since she cant handle it. Cue the pouting and THOSE ARE MY GRANDKIDS. 

Mom I don’t have any kids are we really going to argue over this at all? Do you really want to lose grandparent rights wayyyy before I have kids? 

She came back with “well I’m the grandma they are going to love me more because I’ll spoil them they won’t even want to leave my house” 

I told her if that’s how she feels she can literally just have another baby she’s 40 and still fertile.

She did not like that and said “you never wanted to leave mema and papas(my grandparents on my moms side both very just yes) house! You loved them more than me. That will be my grand baby of course I’m going to do the same thing” 

Yeah mom but mema and papa are literally marriage and family counselors, they understand boundaries and of course I had fun with them but of course I never loved them more than you. 

“Well I guess they did give you back” 

The whole conversation was one face palm.

I have a feeling I’ll be here way more once me and my SO get more serious because she’s completely out of line with him. She made comments once I moved in with him when I turned 18 about how HES STEALING HER DAUGHTER and now I’m going from being controlled by her to BEING CONTROLLED BY A MAN. Yes those were her words exactly because wouldnt I “rather be controlled by someone who gave birth to me and has an obligation to love me” 

No mom I’d like not to be controlled by anyone thank you for your input."
629,"Hi all! Since I have the feeling that I am gonna be using this board a lot to rant, I thought I should give an introduction of my JN mil. I live in my husbands country, therefore all my friends and family are away.

Her and I had a very good relationship until we announced we are pregnant and getting married. Then suddenly she flipped a switch and got even more entitled than she already was. She used to call my husband roughly 10 times per day. Started whining we don’t involve her in the wedding preparations although she wasn’t paying a fucking dime. She said to me she is very unhappy and have no reason to live and when I pointed out that isn’t her expecting grandchild a reason to live, she replied “ten of (my daughter’s name) cannot make her happy”. We invited to come for coffee with us after our first ultrasound in a cafeteria across her building and she didn’t come because we told her last minute and she wouldn’t even go for coffee “even if Brad Pitt called her with such short notice”. She ofc didn’t like the venue we chose, the new house we rent and all in all she was very bitter with her comments. She threatened she will not come to the wedding a day before. 

Fast forward to me giving birth. During her visit at the hospital, she kept telling my husband in their language (but I understand) that I am not holding the baby correctly, kept telling my mom that the next one will be a boy. Then, she was refusing to visit at home because she demanded to stay overnight even though she was living 30’ away. The excuse was that only friends and neighbors visit just for a couple of hours. That resulted in her meeting the baby at 2,5 months. When my daughter was born we made an email where we are collecting all her moments and milestones and we will give it to her at her 18th birthday. We shared it with our families. The witch in law sent the first email and from then on she was sending one per day usually complaining about us and badmouthing us. I won’t give all details now but it was obvious that she was playing victim. We asked her three times to stop sending those emails before she actually complied. From then on she sends one per month. 

1,5 month post partum: she joked with me that if I wasn’t breastfeeding, she would have taken my baby from me and she wouldn’t drop it even after my multiple attempts to make her do so. When I hung up the phone, I went in full panic attack and I had to call her back apologizing for my hormones and asked her to promise me she will never do what she said and never joke again about taking my baby. I was met by “you are crazy. I am sorry you didn’t understand my joke”. At around the same time, she complained at my husband that I haven’t sent her a video or a picture for a couple of days and it turned into a huge fight between me and my husband. 

A couple of months later, I have some problems with my visa and she happens to be with us in the immigration department. She sees me how scared I am, yet she proceeds to joke that I will go to jail and she gets to stay with my daughter. She stayed at our house for the night and because we had flies (summer, open windows without nets in a house up in a hill) she threw a tantrum crying and sobbing that cps would have taken our child should they have seen the house. Prior to that incident, she lied to my husband that I kicked her out of the room (just had put baby down to nap and was replying to her questions but signaling her to be quiet, after she entered the room because I wasn’t replying to her knocking). That caused another argument with my husband. 

Three months later, she jokes again asking when we are going to have another baby so she can take my daughter. 

Fast forward a year, she didn’t pay her electricity bill for like a year and therefore, they cut her power. I was stuck with that bitch for two months! Two months she was sleeping on my couch! She had no plan to repay them and we had to sell smth valuable to pay for her bill and get rid of her. During her stay, she tried to play mama to my daughter multiple times and I still her wrong values of appearance on her. We were on the verge of divorce because of her at this point. 

Fast forward a few months. We decided to sell the apartment that she used to live in (it was my husband’s) and we agreed that we will pay her rent and bills for a new apartment. The bitch chose an even more expensive than ours just because it’s 3’ away and wouldn’t go to anything cheaper 5 streets away from us because it was too far. She thought she would see us more often than once a week that we already seeing her because of that but I kept firm on this one. She is trying to buy my daughters love with toys and chocolate and I had to tell her twice to stop bringing a toy every time she sees her. I also asked her not to buy bulky things which I was completely ignored. I am currently having a toddler car and motorbike that are not in use in my tiny apartment- both bought by her and for both items she told my husband not to tell me what they were before she gives it to my daughter. 

I constantly have to fight her for things like this and emotional manipulation. She tried to tell secrets to my daughter and I have to stop her three times from doing this. The list is endless... this is just a summary since I feel it’s important to know those things in order to understand the whole situation and where I am coming from. Ofc she constantly says how much my daughter looks like her and everything that she has, she took it from her. She is acting to my husband as if she loves me and cares about me but in reality she is just manipulating him. The last incident we had was her calling to talk to my almost 3 year old daughter. Husband told her she will put her on speakerphone as it was easier and she started yelling “no, no, no”. When I confronted him about it, he told me his mom just doesn’t want to be heard. I on the other hand, think that there is no reason for an adult to talk on the phone with a toddler demanding that her parents won’t listen to what she says. I think it’s inappropriate and fishy. And given that I know her character, I think that she knows that the things she wants to say to my toddler are things that we will not approve. 

It’s an ongoing battle with that woman and at times with my husband. Although, he made a huge improvement in setting boundaries with her, he is still cannot see her fully for who she is.
Ohhh and I forgot to mention that she is diagnosed Narcissistic with borderline personality traits but she refuses to get help. Because you know... she can do no wrong...

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read through my novel.

Update: Hey everyone. 

So quick background, the reason why I ended up writing this post in the first place is due to the fact that the SO’s Mum essentially ruined the last two days of our holiday due to her throwing one of her fits again. See below for more details. 

[Previous Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/df0gim/boyfriends_mum_is_driving_a_wedge_between_us/)

I ended up breaking down, having a panic attack and telling the bf that I wasn’t sure how much longer I could do this for. BF said that he was going to put his foot down and fight for our relationship as he can’t let her hurt me anymore, and a couple of days after getting home he calmly told her what happened. We’d still have a long way to go but at least she knows the hurt she’s caused and knows that the bf won’t stand for it anymore.

The problem is, I can’t seem to get over this last bust up. I’m starting to feel like the damage is already done and may be irreversible, but I’d feel like such an arsehole if I started doubting the relationship when he’s started fighting for it. What on earth do I do... I love him and want to be with him but every time I think about this situation my heart almost physically hurts.

Please please help..."
631,"Mil (by text): “Dearest son, let me know what you and PetrichorOzone would like from Europe.”

DH: *

Mil (by text): “I miss you guys, OP, and can’t wait to come home.  What would you like Mama to bring you from Europe?”

Me:  “Nothing, MIL, just enjoy what’s left of your trip.  We’ll see you then.  Everybody’s fine here so no worries.  Bye!”

Mil: “Tell me what I can bring you, OP.”

Me: “Seriously, MIL, we have no expectations.  If you see something there you think we would like, you can bring that home.  You have good taste.” (She has very expensive tastes to be sure.  Super bling which isn’t my style but whatever.)

Mil returns and makes a ceremony of giving me my souvenir from Europe: a $10, hideous vinyl tablecloth from Bed Bath and Beyond Canada.

I mean, I said I had no expectations, but seriously?!?  😂

That’s going straight into a donation bin.

It reminded me of the time she gave our son a toy fire engine that was his “father’s favourite when he was small and I saved it for YOU for all these years.”

I flipped it over and looked at the date of manufacture and asked my husband why he was still playing with toy trucks at 19 years old.  Bahaha!

Fucking narcs, man.   

I bet y’all have some doozy stories too.  Feel free to share."
632,"I am having a miscarriage and I am getting married in a few days. It’s absolutely devastating. Called my dad (long divorced and NC with mom) while SO was at work for support as it’s just such a lonely thing to go through and without someone to talk to I realized it was going to continue to be isolating and hard on me, and telling my people was one way to process the reality of my situation. He said “I’m so sorry” and talked to me with an open mind and it helped. I called my mom when I was calmed down a few days later mainly just so she didn’t hear it through the grape vine and flip out on my wedding day. 

I gave her the strait fact that “I had a miscarriage and I just wanted to let you know”  and the first thing she said was “you should have called me!” 

Uh... are we not on the phone? 

I had to bite my tongue to not lash out verbally about her dictating how I should grieve. My STBH is very supportive and understands that it’s my choice of if/who/how to tell anyone, and my mother is always making it about her and anytime something difficult in my life has happened telling her first has resulted in me comforting her instead of processing my grief/emotions. I always have to be strong first or it’s just a mess and a dick measuring competition over who’s been shit on more in life. I’ve never once heard her admit to anyone else’s pain without comparing it to her own. Now I’m worried that she’s going to go all full grief mode at the wedding and “I lost my grandchild!” (that she would have never known about... though she also claimed after the fact that “she had a feeling” something was up). I got off the phone as fast as I could, but basically felt I was doing damage control from the beginning. I just wanted to be free from the hiding and the shame and grieve the loss of my baby with the baby’s father on my own terms. 

Am I overreacting? 

Historically she’s gotten hysterical about much more minor things: ie- my father (who had primary custody when I was 12) buying me pads and we spent a weekend with her crying and accusing him of “taking away her job as a mother” by helping me not ruin my underwear, accusing him of sexual abuse because he knew I was bleeding (he knew because I told him) and berated me for hiding the pads (I was embarrassed) and accusing me of lying about basically everything else in my life.  

She doesn’t handle being “left out” but her behavior doesn’t make me want to let her in to my life beyond a few brief visits a year.  

“You should have called me” just keeps ringing in my head and I’m feeling like I will never be able to process anything on my own timeline without a guilt trip. She wants me to rely on her but I’m a grown ass woman. I am also full of pregnancy hormones and grief. I don’t want to share much with her, because if it’s my grief now I have twice as much to deal with, and if it’s my happiness it’s actually hers."
633,"My MIL loves to bestow gifts on our daughters...but frequently leaves out our son. My DH is an only child, so these are her only grandchildren. They are 9(f), 8(m), and 5(f). Her reasoning is that she doesn’t know what to get him. I’ve suggested that she simply ask us what he’d like, but that is “déclassé” in her mind. 
She’s coming for Thanksgiving tomorrow and I’ve asked DH to tell her that she either brings for all or none of the kids. 
How would you handle this?

Edit to add: she came bearing equally crappy gifts for all. They can keep the candy and the books from 1965 will go to the thrift store. Crappy is always a given, but at least it was equal."
634,"I am reposting this to add a Trigger Warning for of eating disorder and didn't think about it the first time I posted. I apologize mods, please don't delete this.

Hey y'all, this is an old story so no need for advice. Recently, I started watching the second season or the Netflix show Insatiable (it's a guilty pleasure show) *SPOILERS*  and they started tackling eating disorders. Specifically over eating disorders. It made me remember this story.

So for some background, I've had an unhealthy relationship with food as far back as I can remember and its caused me to be overweight and have body image issues. I've brought it up to a couple of councelor and others who I always trusted would know better than I, but was always told it was nothing, I just needed to go on a diet or excercise more. I wondered if I had an eating disorder, but since I wasn't starving myself or purging, I couldn't possible have an actual disorder, I was just weird about food.

Earlier this year, my husband and I both had a psychological exam done as a requirement for CPS in the ongoing case to get custody of his daughters. When we got thr results of the exam, right there in black and white was confirmation that I had waited years to receive, that I indeed did (and still do) have an eating disorder. It was honestly such a relief to see actual proof that I wasn't just a fatass who needed to try harder to with diets, but an actual underlying issue that I could now start getting treatment for.

At this time UAV and I still had a rather good relationship and I was in some pretty dense FOG. She knew we were having the exam and wanted to know the results. Here is how the convo went (not exactly since this happened several months ago though)

UAV: So what did the results of the psych exam say?

Me: Well DH and I both have depression and anxiety, which we already knew, but its suggested that I start seeing a nutritionist.

UAV: Why would you need to do that?

Me: Because I have an over eating disorder.

UAV: Oh, no you don't.

Me: Um... yes I do. I have for a while, but now I have p- (she cut me off)

UAV: No, you're fine. I've seen you eat and nothing is wrong. You just need to eat healthier is all.

Me: I think it's still a good idea - (cut off again)

UAV: Don't waste your money, nothing is wrong with you. I would know if something was (because she is all knowing of course /s)

After that I just kind of felt dejected and changed the conversation. It felt like that confirmation and relief I had had been snatched away from me. What made it worse was I think her and DH talked about it at some point, because when I brought it up to DH later, he said the same thing as his mom; that I was fine because he had seen me eat and didn't see a problem.

I still haven't seen a nutritionist yet because I just kind of pushed it to the back of my head and still haven't received any help for my problems because the thought has been sitting in my mind that maybe I don't actually have a disorder and it's just me being a fatass. Watching this show on Netflix made all those memories from earlier this year come back. Now, there is representation in the media of something other than anorexia and bulimia. I'm not crazy and just a fatass, overeating disorders without a purge or starvation period exist and are a real problem.

Y'all, I cannot describe the how good it feels to know that I have a treatable problem and it's not just a character flaw within me. I'm already doing research into how I can tackle this and it's something I plan on bringing up to in therapy and demanding that we focus on trying to solve it.

On the flip side, I am pissed as shit now after realizing exactly what UAV said and how it effected me. Seriously, it's just so fucked up and I'm kind of mad at DH for being on her side about it, but he has since at least realized that I actually do have an issue and is encouraging me to seek help. I know even if I went to her now with a professional with me who told her I do indeed have an eating disorder, she would still say its nonsense and that I'm fine.

The more and more I keep realizing the fucked up things she has said and done to me, the less and less I want her to be around my family (DH and kids at least) but I have to wait for her to seriously fuck up before I can completely go nuclear and demand she have no access to the kids. I have a feeling I know exactly how she will do it too, but I'll save that for another post since this is already longer than I anticipated.

Tl;dr - I have an overeating disorder and have for a very long time. Never really was able to pinpoint it until I got a psych exam that diagnosed it. Told UAV the results and she insisted I was fine and nothing was wrong with me. Went back to feeling like I was crazy and just a fatass with no will power until I saw the show Insatiable and realized it actually is a problem and I need to deal with it."
635,"NC is so sweet.

Background, I didn’t change my name after marriage, I just didn’t want to for a number of reasons, one of which was the idea of sharing ILs surname. I got a lot of shit for it “won’t DH mind?” “Oh poor DH, why are you marrying him if you don’t want to take his name” “you’ll change your mind when you have kids; it’s important for children to have the same name as their mothers” blah blah blah.

MIL HATES this. My SIL(who is MILs step daughter) also did not change her name for similar reasons to me, they justify this by saying “she was very well established in her field, people needed to recognise her” so both myself and SIL have always got cards/packages/everything addressed to Mrs Not Your Last Name. This irritated me because 1) it’s not my last name 2) it feels intentionally disrespectful 3) I prefer Ms. MIL has been told this repeatedly and in the entire time we’ve been married she’s always addressed things to Mrs Not Your Last Name. 

To avoid giving too much information we’ve recently suffered a loss and returned home from a big trip. Husband told her about the loss and she sent the most over the top I’m “I’m so sorry” message to the family group chat(which I want to leave but... I just can’t) almost aimed just at me, when before I don’t think she’d have been bothered. And then we got home to a HUGE bunch of flowers, a vase and a candle address, to wait for it, Mr &amp; Mrs Not Your Last Name-Last Name.

We haven’t double barrelled just kept our own names but finally after years and years it turns out the key to getting her to acknowledge me is to ignore her permanently. Too late. If you cared about me you would have acknowledged me from the start."
636,"FDH and I are planning a wedding currently. Fortunately we’re taking care of most of the costs (meaning that luckily, her opinion isn’t really taken into account THAT much). But she of course has an opinion on everything.

Example. We said that at our wedding during the ceremony we don’t want anyone taking pictures because they get in the way of the photographers, ruin other people’s experiences, and no one is going to take a blurry pic on their cell phone better than the professional ones. She of course flipped because she “loves taking pics of brides and the bridesmaids etc!” “My friends are going to want these pictures!” OF COURSE MIL!! Your biddy friends are precisely the people we want to stop! She’s like “it’s rude to make an announcement or have a sign, people are entitled to take pics.” No MIL it’s our wedding and our desire to have a cell phone free ceremony outweighs your guests wants. 

“They’ll never see the professional ones!” Yes they will because you’re the biggest Facebook oversharer and also, who cares?? Anyone important to us or the family can have whatever pics they want-after. 

The phone call ended with me saying how I was off from work this week (holiday). So she asked me if “I would have nice dinners prepared for FDH when he came home from work??” WTF. I think she thinks I do absolutely nothing for him or in our relationship. She’s always asking if I did this or that, if I drove, if I cooked. There’s nothing wrong with me cooking for him of course but I hate how she asks, as if I’m not taking good care of her fully grown independent and competent adult child.

Fortunately, FDH was also annoyed and bluntly answered “no, it’s not the 1950s anymore” and pointed out that we take turns cooking different meals. 

Ugh."
637,"So to preface this, I have severe anxiety and even just talking to my MIL is hard for me sometimes. So I’m really proud I could stick to my guns on this one. 

This all happened yesterday. My MIL recently read an article where a psychologist said that kids should be able to pack their own lunch and learn how to cook and clean from around 8 years old. I agree with this as I feel it teaches them a lot of good life skills. My MIL does not. The conversation kind of went like this: 

MIL: He’s a complete idiot. The only thing I get to do as a mum is make food and clean for my babies. Why would I want to give that up? 

Me: You don’t have to give it up. Just let them help you. Or teach them to be able to do it on their own when you possibly can’t. 

MIL: That’s crazy! I cook and clean for my babies so they don’t have to. Once they NEED to learn, they will on their own. 

Me: That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think? It’s like throwing them into life with no idea how to function. They need to at least know the basics so they can survive! 

MIL: *demonic screeching of disagreement* 

She eventually refused to speak to me any further after I told her I can raise my own children however I want and then proceeded to grumble that I am “delusional”. I don’t think I am. My SO barely knew how to use a mop and couldn’t even boil water because he was unsure of how much to use and was scared of “flooding the stove”. He lived off take-out and his apartment was only cleaned when MIL came to visit. I had to teach him everything he knows from scratch and by now we help each other just fine. We have a good teamwork thing going in our household and he has stated to me several times that he wishes he knew more before meeting me because he was ashamed at how many times he had to ask me things like “how do I use a vacuum?” Or “how do I make pasta?” 

But anyway, she now refuses to speak to me entirely until I admit I am wrong. It’s been causing a few problems as it makes dinners very awkward (we’re visiting for the week). My SO says I shouldn’t back down, but everyone else seems to be taking MIL’s side. I don’t plan on saying I’m wrong, but how can I at least make the situation a bit better so she’ll talk to me again? I don’t want this to cause more trouble going forward.

Edit: Holy cow this blew up fast!! I didn’t expect this at all as I felt this was a fairly minor-ish issue. Thank you so so much to everyone commenting and giving advice. I will be going through it all and trying to reply to as many as I possibly can. Your advice has really made me feel like I’m doing the right thing and has helped me find my spine with MIL. Thank you thank you thank you!

Edit 2: Thank you so much for my first ever silver!!! I can’t believe it!"
638,"Hello all!

So, to set the scene here it is our (adopted) son’s 17th birthday. He wanted to go out with friends in his new truck (he and DH have been working on for a year, they are both proud) and eat dinner with us at his favorite restaurant! 

Simple, no issues, everything should be fine right? But we all know I wouldn’t be posting here if that was what the future had in store. 

My JNMIL is the pickiest eater. She doesn’t like lettuce, she won’t eat shrimp, she doesn’t like tomatoes or rice or green beans. She won’t eat turkey and she doesn’t like eggs. I promise you, if it doesn’t come from a drive through or out of the microwave meal section she will not eat it. And she HATES Chinese food. Can you guess my sons favorite restaurant was Chinese by now? Cause it is. There is a lovely restaurant not far from our house that he has been obsessed with for a while and so we booked it for the weekend of his birthday and sent out the invitations. 

We didn’t hear back from DHs side of the family so he reached out a few days before the party. “Hey did you guys get the invite? The plan is ___!” 

Cue MILs huge temper tantrum. “Yes I got the invitation but we aren’t going and I’m not speaking to you!” 

DH, accustomed to her antics and bored, “Why is that exactly?”

 “RWF SPECIFICALLY CHOSE THAT RESTAURANT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS I HATE IT! I can’t go because I don’t want to eat there and I will have to go hungry!” 

My husband just laughs and says “Well, it’s sons favorite restaurant and his birthday, so I’m sorry YOU don’t like Chinese food but there is a kids menu with fries and chicken. I’m sure you can make that work.” 

Y’all, she showed up and sulked the entire time, complained loudly, and was just generally obnoxious. I smiled and pretended not to notice she was pouting or know why she would be but seethed inside because she was trying to ruin my son’s birthday. All because she didn’t like Chinese food."
639,"Hey - long time no see, it’s coming up to a year since my mother visited and blew up our relationship . I spent a week out of work and had to try get therapy because my OCD turned into self harm and destructive behaviours.

So she asked to come visit in a few weeks, I am genuinely busy, mostly because I’m starting group therapy in a few weeks and the run up to Christmas has begun in the commercial world.

So I said; unfortunately between now and Xmas is a bad time.

- she directed me to Charlotte churches documentary about her no contact from her mother and told me not to judge her 

&lt;I said I would watch it&gt;

- told me she was visiting to reconcile lingering despite never telling me that and how disrespectful to her and my Dad I am as thy cannot simply understand my behaviour

- told me I am unwilling or incapable of moving on and tried using an example: ‘are saying you and FDH never fought and moved on?!’ (Funny thing is we actually never do fight, maybe 2 fights in over 4 years while drunk and I don’t drink now)

&lt;at this point I told her I’m not engaging with her tantrum and that it’s inconvenient for visits and that stands&gt;

- claims it not a tantrum, how is she suppose to feel when her only daughter won’t see her. 

-apparently I never contact them - which isn’t true, just rarer because I know she has been drinking. 

- told me not to text her and only write/call 

- she deserves more than this from her daughter 

It’s amazing what telling someone no will do. Like setting off a fuse, so my entire day is was stuck doing ritualistic habits to try calm down.

I don’t know what to do going forwards - what am I doing keeping this woman in my life? Should I just give up and call time in this relationship? What can I do when she is like this? Please, someone tell me what the hell I should do, is it fixable? I’m almost 30."
640,"Sorry for formatting i’m on mobile. Also, this is my first time posting and i’m a little nervous. 

A little background; My FMIL and FFIL are in a pretty tight situation money wise. FFIL is the only one who works and only make a yearly income of a spit $30,000. FMIL is a SAHM (stay at home mom) which honestly takes a lot of work and if you are one more power to you. Except her idea of a SAHM is getting drunk and high all day long while letting her house stays a huge mess. FDH and I are a pretty young couple, still in our teens actually. We currently live with my Mom because rents cheaper and it’s in a better location for us. Not to mention 10000% less toxic. 

FMIL still hard complete access to FDH’s banking information and even had the app with his log in. This morning he noticed $50 was pulled out of his account. Now my SO has always been a huge mamas boy so he politely messaged her to ask why she pulled $50 out of his account. Her response? She needed it for ‘cigarettes, chew and shit.’ FDH was upset with her response but ignored the whole situation and went to work. 

Now I was beyond livid with her. She didn’t even think if he had bills automatically coming out of his account or if he idk needed the money. I messaged her and let her know that what she did was wrong and if she really needed the money she should have asked. Sidebar: I was a debater for several years so I most likely sounded cold and analytical. she proceeded to tell me to go to hell, i wasn’t welcomed there, that she never wanted a relationship with me, and that  I was taking her baby. The entire time I was having a major panic attack and messaging FDH. 

This isn’t the first time she’s taken FDH’s money. A couple months back he gave his parents $300 to hold onto because he was buying a car off of FB. When he went to go get his money his parents had spent it with out telling him. He didn’t say anything to them and he just forgot about the problem. 

FDH was beyond upset with the way his mother was treating me and the way that she believed she was in the right for taking his money. He basically told her that she wasn’t his mother anymore and that she can forget about ever seeing mine and FDH’s future kids. That she woulda no longer be a part of our lives and can forget about coming to the wedding. 

Well some may find this as a victory I feel like i some how ruined his relationship with his mother. their relationship has been strained because of her alcoholism but I feel like this couldn’t be more of my fault. 

Did I do something wrong or is FMIL a classic JUSTNO case? I’m desperate for some advice."
641,"Background: MIL invited herself up to “clean and cook” after getting crazy because we hadn’t called/texted her in a week. 

DH actually got up super early yesterday and called MIL  and told her that this Sunday would not work for us - and if she was visiting,  cleaning and cooking for us is not appropriate. 

I am SUPER proud of DH. He’s very easy going and typically a yes-man when it comes to his family so this was a big step. 

Surprisingly, MIL just agreed with him and left it at that. I’m wondering if he either caught her in a good mood or if something else is brewing."
642,"Been a long time since posting here, but goodness do I have nearly weekly stories. It's become so normal that I forget sometimes how wild this is. Back to wedding stuff!... Did I mention we have been married 4 years?

Story time about MIL (typical cast):

Earlier this week my phone is blowing up at work. I take it as an emergency call. My policy is 2+ calls = emergency.... or MIL drama. 

Me: Hello? Everything Okay?

MIL: Hi. Yes, of course. We need to talk about your anniversary. 

Me: MIL, I'm at work. I can't talk.

MIL: I know you are. Just come over tonight. We are celebrating your anniversary.

Me: .... what? No I'll call you later.

(Our anniversary wasn't until today, Oct 12. This phone call was Tuesday)

MIL: Just come over after work so we can celebrate it.  *click*

Now, you might think this is cute. Or sweet. Or a surprise party. Or a nice dinner. No. Something is going on. MIL doesn't like me, I stole her baby boy, etc. Something is up. So I call FIL on break.

Me: What is MIL talking about?

FIL (who knows his wife is nuts and who I have great relationship with): MIL says you are coming over for your anniversary.

Me: You guys know my husband isn't home for the next two days, right? 

FIL: Oh for crying out loud.... I'll talk to her.

Cue THE phone call:

MIL: I said you're coming over tonight. Why are you making this difficult? 

Me: Husband isn't home for the next few days. So it would just be me.

MIL: That's fine. We can have your anniversary dinner anyway.

Me:.... No? That's... silly. 

MIL proceeded to get angry that I was refusing this idea, that I was lying about her son being away on business, that I was being selfish. After a few moments, she hung up in a fit. 

Well, today I found out why! Yay! Answers! 

.... It's because my anniversary was too close to Thanksgiving, which was 'her' holiday, and she warned me today to make absolutely no mention of it this weekend at all. 

MIL doesn't want me to distract people from the TRUE meaning of this weekend: Which is that she is a fabulous host, cooks a perfect turkey and doesn't want me 'distracting' people with my 'cries for attention' by having an anniversary. 

Basically: I wasn't allowed to steal her thunder. 

So why was she trying to get us to go over for dinner, you may be wondering?

FIL filled me in on that logic:

She wanted us to MOVE our anniversary date so that we could celebrate it early to 'get it out of the way'. And that by refusing to come over, I was trying to ruin Thanksgiving. Thus confirming I'm the difficult one.

Ah yes. I'm being SO difficult with wanting to spend my wedding anniversary with the actual person I married. How selfish I am. /s

Today we did all sorts of fun things! It was great!

We posted it all over our social media, as any young couple does. I got a phone call halfway through the day today from MIL, telling us very sternly to mind our manners tomorrow and not talk about anything unrelated to Thanksgiving. 

I proceeded to put her on speaker phone and asked her if she would like to explain to her son why we weren't allowed to talk about our anniversary. MIL quickly hung up, after shouting for me to not cause drama.

Fortunately, FIL has plans to save me from MILs wrath tomorrow. We will see how that goes when my own mother comes over and wants to see photos of what we got up to 😉

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!"
643,"I'm not sure how much advice I need vs how much TLC ... but this is happening right now and I'm freaking the hell out, so this is also kind of a rant .. I throw myself to your mercy, I guess.

I (32F) have had a complicated relationship with my mother my whole life. I had a lot of problems with both of my parents - neglect from my Mom, drunken psychological abuse from my Dad who separated when I was 4 - and I never wanted to rock the boat so I hid my problems through my childhood. I was later diagnosed as on the spectrum for Autism, I suffer from anxiety and depression, complex PTSD, massive memory problems, and have a complex dissociative identity condition. Also, there are a slough of physical problems (PCOS, immune deficiency, the list goes on). 

Since my mother was raised by the WASPiest WASPs who ever did WASP, I figured she wouldn't react well to learning that I was weak, fragile, and broken. I thought anything could be pushed through with willpower, and to a certain extent I was able to make things work. There were a lot of cracks that have taken me a decade of therapy to really start to work through, but I survived my childhood and thought I had a decent relationship with my mother.

Recently, as part of therapy, I've started telling the important people in my life the truth about my situation, which involves being honest about my mental and physical disabilities. Most people have been awesome. My D(ear) Wife is amazing. Her family, less so, but I'm NC with my JNMiL, so that's fine.

My mother, on the other hand, is NOT OKAY. 

We live on opposite sides of the continent in two different countries, so we meet in the middle for a week to spend my birthday together. Last year I started opening up about some of the things I'd been hiding, and she reacted pretty well. She apologised for not noticing what I was going through, tried to be understanding.

This year, I tried to continue that. Except that apparently in the interim, she's had a year to think about what I told her, and her WASPs had plenty of time to come out and buzz in her ears. This year, instead of understanding and compassion, I got much of the standard bullshit: ""if you have a positive attitude and force yourself to act normal, your disabilities will magically go away!""; ""have you tried getting a second opinion?"" (this, after talking about the three doctors I saw); ""You never seemed \[tired/anxious/in pain\] when I saw you."". She has blamed my wife, who made me see doctors when we got married, because it's easier for my mother to blame DW than it is to accept that I had a problem that she overlooked.

The week ended with a painful conversation. She said it was a good thing that I never allowed myself to show negative emotions; when I said that something bothered me, she told me to get stronger meds from my psychiatrist because apparently being sad or upset about anything is not allowed. 

I told her that my psychiatrist had suggested I not talk to her, because processing her baggage on top of my own was impeding my ability to make progress. She suggested that I see about checking into an institution so that I could focus on getting well, since the other factors in my life (read: my supportive wife) are derailing me. And then, in the same conversation, said that I should ""consider thinking about other people some time. It might do \[me\] good to care about someone other than \[myself\].""

I saw red. I shut down. Fortunately it was the last day of our trip, and so I went home, and she went on vacation to somewhere in Europe, and sent me tone-deaf messages for a month while I tried to figure out what I had done to make her turn on me. I blamed myself. I scrutinized everything I'd said and done, looking for mistakes; when I tripped and fell because my joints are weak and I struggle with balance, she teased me, and I asked her not to. She told me that she ""would have thought \[I'd\] be able to have a sense of humor"" about it; when I pointed out that this happened every day, it was frustrating, not funny, I got the classic ""Well, I don't know how to talk to you.""

Slowly, over the course of the month, I realized that I hadn't done anything wrong. I wasn't a bad person for existing, I didn't intentionally break myself for attention, I'm not faking it, I'm not ... any of the things the dark corners of my brain were telling me. I was starting to feel like myself again.

Well, now she's back from her vacation. I sent her a little text reply, ""Are you glad to be home?"" because I'm a decent human being and she likes to know I'm alive, and I'm okay with that. 

And then I get this message. [https://imgur.com/9XWttMc](https://imgur.com/9XWttMc)

I AM SO ANGRY! First of all, this woman has psych training. She was a guidance counselor for twenty years. She knows passive aggressive language, she knows blame-shifting, SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING. And she's my goddamned mother! She should know better!!! Instead, she's dragging hooks into me the first instant she can, re-opening wounds that I was only barely just starting to nudge closed. 

And now I'm back to feeling powerless. I can't stop her from phoning. I can't make her remember all of the things she used to know, I can't summon back the person she used to be, the kind compassionate woman who listened to me and tried to tell me that I could be anything.

Now it's all about her, and I'm waiting for the next steel-toed boot to land on my head.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I don't have to answer the phone when/if she calls. I don't have to read her messages. But there are consequences to doing that, so either way I have to spend mental resources that I don't have deciding what risks are worth taking/which costs are worth paying. I have valued having her in my life; if it turns out that I'm going to have to cut her out, even for a little while, that's going to be another big blow I'll have to endure. 

Nothing is simple, except how goddamned angry I am right now."
644,"Hi all, I've lurked a lot and only posted once I think. Sorry for formatting as im on mobile and just stopped crying. My FMIL is insane but unfortunately so is my mother. My parents and younger sibling are visiting for the weekend. Some background: I'm 22(F) living with my 23 (M) fiance, we've been together 5 years. In less than a year I'll be graduating with 90k in debt for 2 college degrees. I've maintained a full time job for 4 years, often working overtime to pay bills, but am needing to go back down to part time as my courses are insanely demanding in the last year. I make $8 an hour after taxes,  my partner recently became a medic so we're tight on cash but NEVER ask my parents for help. 

My father works 50+ hours a week but makes decent money, and my mom has been a SAHM for 22 years and just recently got a part time job. Please note, this is not me saying SAHM is not a job, because it is, I get it. There is no judgement for SAHM and I admire you deeply, just not my own mother. She has refused to get a job even after I moved out and spends my father's money like it's going out of style. She is always ordering things and going on shopping sprees. My dad has told me before he thinks he will never be able to retire because of her spending, and earlier told me it's gotten worse because she thinks the part time job she has is bringing in forkloads of cash. 

Now, I have clinical chronic depression and GAD, which of course manifests itself even worse when shes around. My house is pretty clean but not spotless because I'm trying to stop myself from obsessing and using unhealthy coping methods to handle her coming. I have a handful of half empty bath and body works in my tub (buy 3 get 3, you see into my soul). I was talking to her about how I just ordered a $15 subscription box for hispanic goodies (we're hispanic) and I was excited for it. 

Cue ""you're a broke college student you need to act like it""
""I dont spend frivolously"" I said and she scoffed at me. ""Give me an example of my poor spending""
""I saw the bath and body works in your bathroom!""
""Its buy 3 get 3 mom it's not a fortune""
""Well I dont buy 3 or get 3""
""So because I go to b+bw twice a year I'm not frugal?"" I then started to cry because we've had a long history of her combing through my bank accounts and credit card transactions and accusing me of stealing money from her and I really thought I was going to get through this visit without another inquisition. 

She then apologized to shut me up ""I'm sorry okay jeez"" and then said ""I apologized three times I'm not going to say it again"" when I tried explaining how it made me feel. I dont really have a purpose for posting other than needing someone to vent to and just scream into the void so I can make it through the next 36 hours. If you made it to the end, thank you."
645,"So our youngest had a birthday party at the end of the summer, DH and I invited family and friends to the party. When it comes time to cut and serve the birthday cake I asked my MIL if she wanted any cake. She of course said yes. However she was in our living room which I really didn’t want anyone eating in there as we recently had ants in there because my kids dropped a grape under the couch and I spent all week cleaning and getting rid of the ants. There was also a child attendee who was rummaging through our house and in the living room at the same time as MIL and I didn’t want a small child getting cake all over the house. I started to give her the plate with cake and then took it away and asked her, “could you eat this in the kitchen please?” And I set her plate with cake at the kitchen table. She said, “I understand,” and followed me into the kitchen. Once we got there, she stood by the island and started rolling her eyes and sighing. I apologized twice because I realized that it was because I asked her to eat cake in the kitchen. I go outside to tell DH about the situation and when I returned, she had left the party. I couldn’t believe she left her grandchild’s party over being asked to eat in the kitchen.

Fast forward to this past week, DH asks FIL about MIL and FIL says, “she’s waiting for littlecajunlady to apologize.” I sent her an email this week saying that I was sorry if her feelings got hurt but I’m not sorry for asking her to eat sugary cake at a child’s birthday party in the kitchen and that she has to respect our house rules. She emails DH back (not me) and goes on about how rude I was, I’m unwelcome in their house, and fuck my house rules. 

Also, ever since this incident she hasn’t spoken to anyone in my household. Also, she is the type of person who loves to hold grudges and brags about how long she’s been holding her grudges. No telling how long she’s going to be upset about this.

DH fully has my back on this and agrees that she is being utterly ridiculous. I can tell that he’s hurt that his own mother hasn’t spoken to him in almost 3 months.

Edit: Thanks everyone! I wasn’t sure if I was actually being rude or not. I’m not a confrontational person and I hate conflict so this whole situation has just been stressing me out."
646,"MIL was asking me what size clothing my son wears and I told her he’s in 12M going on to 18M clothing. She starts talking like she’s going to get him some clothes then retracts her statement saying “well, you probably don’t want clothes too far in advance since your house is small”. Gross. I don’t know why she felt so compelled to just throw that comment in there. Her house is even smaller than ours. She’s right though, I don’t want her junky second hand clothing taking up room at my house anyways. Girl byeeeee."
647,"Thank you to everyone who takes time to read this whole mess.

Heres some background info to understand the story better;

* I (22 F) got pregnant at 15 and mom helped me raise my son, which led her to have like an obsession with my son.
* I had no authority over my LO while living there. At that house, he was my moms son.
* Since I was a LO, mom has been with a man who was physically and mentally abusive to my sister and I.
* Last year my sister confessed that she was also abused by him sexually. Mom doesn't believe this and claims she made up the story since she was on meds.
* Moved out at 18 years  old and have been living with my IL's since.
* DH and I have a 2 month old now.
* I refuse to let mom see her grandkids often because she is still with her abusive boyfriend, this drives her nuts and we've had issues the past years because of that fact.
* She treats my 7 y/o and 2 month old differently, even saying that my 2 month old will never live up to my 7 y/o.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday DH and I went out and left the kids at my aunts house. Since she lived close to my mom I was dumb and decided text my mom to let her know that the boys were over there if she wanted to visit. My mom started texting me that how could I do this to her, I was an evil daughter, she would have never done that to her mom, and to watch out for what God has coming for me. I told her that she knows exactly why I don't let her babysit. I absolutely refuse to let her boyfriend near my kids but she never understands. 

We were arguing until I returned home. Thats when I told her to come over and lets settle everything once and for all face to face. My IL's were out of town so it would be a perfect time to confront her. She replied by telling me ""ok but tell DH to be prepared because I'm saying everything"". I told DH what she said and he was confused and wondering why he should be prepared.

She arrived and greeted DH and I warmly. I started telling her that her boyfriend is the main reason why I can't work things out with her. I would love to fix our relationship and have her spend time with her grandkids but she has to leave that man. Before I could say any more she cut me off and said, ""wait, first I need to let you know who you really married. Your husband grabs my ass every time he greets me!!!"". This stunned DH and I. DH got understandably upset and started yelling at her, saying things like, ""What are you talking about?! You're like 100 years old!!! You disgust my crazy old lady!!!"" and they argued for a while.

She told me that when I was pregnant, he would come over to her house alone to talk to her. This was true and I knew this because DH would call me after every visit! The reason he would visit would be for me! He knew how I wanted to fix the relationship with my mom so he went out of his way to try and reason with her himself. He would tell me everything they talked about. She even invited him over herself to plan my baby shower and to tell him to try to convince me to forgive her boyfriend for everything so she can see 'her boy'. The only time DH might have touched her ass is when he offered to carry her when she had a broken ankle (which he told me about).

She told me that she even has witnesses to this assault. My uncle who was living with her at that time. I told her to call him right there on the spot. After I said that she said, ""Wait there was another witness too! This woman that goes over to pray with me! DH didn't see her there because she was hiding"". I kept telling her to call the witnesses because I want to talk to them. She would only call the woman that I haven't even seen or heard of in my life. Also, my uncle who also supposedly witnessed this recently moved out of state so it was funny how the witnesses were someone who moved out of state and someone who I just now heard of.

After a long night of arguing she finally said that shes done and leaving. I told her if she leaves without resolving this then she's never seeing me or my family again. She said OK and left. A little later I got a call from this mysterious lady witness and she told me that she never saw anything! But my mom did tell her about DH and every time the lady visited my mom, she would look terrified opening the door because she thought it was DH. She told me to believe mom because she's so scared of DH! Even though my mom has always greeted DH with a big hug and kiss.

Today I went to see my sister and tell her everything. She told me that my mom texted her after sarcastically saying ""We're not going to the restaurant tomorrow! Thanks a lot!"" as if she was blaming her for everything for some reason? I also told my cousins the situation and they let me know that my mom was at a family party that same night and was drinking heavily so maybe that caused her to say that. I got my uncles number from them who was also a supposed witness. 

I called him and asked if he ever saw DH do anything inappropriate with my mom and he said no. He got along great with DH, he was there every single time DH visited so there was no time they were alone, and he doesn't know why she would say that. I recorded the phone call I had with my uncle to have evidence.

After confirming that her accusations were false I obviously felt relief. DH was so upset that people may believe her stories that he started to cry because a sexual assault accusation would ruin his dreams of becoming a cop. I knew my mom was manipulative and loves being the victim but I didn't think she would go that low. Safe to say that there is no fixing the relationship with my mom now, I just don't know if I should contact her so she can explain herself or just drop her completely."
648,"My FMIL is a piece of work. She's mostly, kind of JY, but definitely has since JN moments. Ever since we got engaged, her JN moments have exponentially increased in frequency.

My dream wedding is a small courthouse thing with just us and two witnesses. FDH wants a massive party. So, we're having a massive party (which I'm okay with). Being that it wasn't exactly what I wanted, FMIL took it upon herself to start planning everything and FDH encouraged her because, at the time, he thought that since I didn't want this wedding, I wouldn't want to plan it. This had since been corrected and he told his mom to back off. She has not. 

They live on the opposite side of the country than us, so it's hard to get them involved. When they came to visit in March, we took them to visit the venue. Even though we had an appointment, I still felt bad because FMIL would not stop talking about her dan grandkids and where they could nap and shit like that. And my sometimes-oblivious-but-JYFFIL, wouldn't stop asking about the golf courses. 

Anyways, back to the wedding. His parents offered us some money for our wedding with ""no strings attached"". A few months later, she comes to us with a list of demands:
1. She wants to invite every person who was invited to FSIL's wedding. Including family FDH hasn't seen in years and never talks to. Including her friends because ""it would be disrespectful not to..."" Note: she did offer to pay for her friends.
2. She wants to invite her family to the rehearsal dinner because all of my family will be there (only my sisters because they are IN the wedding). She also wants all of her friends to come.
3. She's making welcome bags for our hotel guests. I'm already making these.
4. She's throwing a pizza party for people at the hotel after that wedding that she expects us and my family and friends to attend when neither us nor my family is staying at the hotel. She's expecting everyone to go out of their way to go to her pizza party?
5. This one is my favorite. She wants to walk my FDH down the aisle...... preferably right before I come down the aisle. She is guilt tripping FDH saying how upset and hurt she would be of she can't. She keeps saying it's Jewish tradition (whether it is or isn't, I'm annoyed that she's trying to use her religion as a point to guilt FDH into allowing it). 

Just a side note, because of points 1, 3, and 4, she is giving us much less money even though we still have to pay for all the guests and we're already doing welcome bags. I'm not trying to be selfish, but I'm just shocked about her logic.

Anyways, FDH and her were talking and demand #4 came up. We made a compromise to just have the dinner be wedding party and we can meet with out of town guests afterwards for drinks. Y'all, SHE. LOST. HER. SHIT. But my FDH and his sexy, shiny spine shut her down. He told her this is OUR wedding. We ARE tasting the out of town guests to dinner...at OUR wedding. Inviting out of town guests to the rehearsal dinner would be a second wedding. So, she says that she's not coming. FDH, who was a self-ptoclaimed Mama's boy, told her, ""okay. then we'll see you at the wedding."" I was so proud of him because I was pretty sure that he would try to find a way to make her happy and fulfill her demands. But he did not. He took my side. Afterwards, he was really upset because if she freaked out over the rehearsal dinner, how is she going to react when he tells her she is not walking him down the aisle. But that's another problem for another day.

I am so proud of my man. I am so proud that he took my side. I am so proud that he stood up to his mom knowing it was so hard for him to do. I am so proud (and relieved) that he addressed the problem with his mom rather than asking me to. I know that there are going to be many other battles with this woman, but I'm not worried at all because I know FDH and I will be united.

Thanks for reading this far! I'm definitely open to any and all advice about how to deal with this boundry-stomping woman who is strangely obsessed with her son."
649,"Sorry but kinda long story ,just need to vent and maybe get some advice. 
my boyfriend M(29) and I F(24) agreed to rent a house with FMIL  until we get ours built  within the next 2 years ,we both work full time jobs , he was his own welding buissness and I am a nursing assistant . FMIL works as a aide and does private duty acouple times a week.
Also important  we have a 4 year old Black Lab and a 30 year old African grey parrot. 
 FMIL was living in a  toxic living situation with his older sister the two of them have been at eachothers throats the past two years and 3 months ago it got physical. My boyfriend and I where in the process of finding another  place when he dropped the ball and asked me if I would be okay with having mom move in with us until we bought our house . I was a bit taken back and had reservations but I love him very much and wanted to do the right thing he never asks me for anything and seemed like he really wanted this.  
The 2 years I've known her shes always been very respectful of our relationship, welcoming , just a lovely person so I said yes and splitting rent between 3 people is way cheaper . We split rent and utilities 3 ways and do groceries separately. If we make a meal we make enough for everyone. 
So now It is 3 months later I am at my Wits end and don't know what to do . She constantly is criticizing me and the way I cook, any compliment is followed by a criticism.  I made a pot roast and she said "" this isnt pot roast this is stew "" and just kept saying it . I was making cookies and made the dough balls and she came behind me and smooshed them flat and laughed and said that's the right way to do it  .
She picks at me about my grocery shopping and says I buy to much and waste money. ITS MY MONEY AND WE USE IT  
Any time I put things in the trash she comes behind me and stomps it down with her foot and if I take the trash out she tells me I'm wasting bags and need to stop taking it out.  I dont want our house smelling like trash.  If it is full I'm not smashing it down any more and having bag rip when I walk out. She smokes and every time she goes outside she let's the dog out on tie out with her and now he assumes that just because someone is at the door he is coming outside which has created some really shitty dangerous behaviors he never had  like door dashing . She constantly fills his dog bowl and gives b
Him table food which makes him shit constantly and beg horribly and then bitches about it  
I work 2nd shift as a nurse aide so I'm home in the morning but am gone all evening.  I woke up the other morning and took Luke outside and came outside to her screaming at me and picking up dog shit and saying I don't pick up after my dog . I said yes I do . She told me I'm a liar. I said I'm not home in the evening and when you let him out non stop I cant keep track of it and I usually just pick it up in morning like right now and she just kept telling me I was full of shit . I went upstairs until he got home from work and told him to come with me we took Luke and went and bought a dog crate . While we where in the car I just lost my cool and vented to him all my frustrations and what was going on and he listened and said he would talk to her and that she can be very controlling and she is just testing me and I need to stand up for myself I then got even more upset and said I shouldn't have to do this in my own home when I did a favor agreeing To this.  He said he would talk to her. 
 and I then said to tell her Luke is going back on a schedule like he was before because this is out of control and I dont want the conflict or my dog getting hurt.  I said when him or I arent home he is to stay in the crate and she is not to touch him.  She said we shouldn't be dog owners and its cruel to cage him  . He spoke to her about this later and told me she felt bad and was just upset and that she really does love me . And she is just acting like nothing happened. 
Then theres the bird . I like to sleep in to about 9/10am . She starts whistling at the bird at like 7am and gets him going whistling back and it just starts my day off shitty because I've had this bird almost 10 years and he never wolf whistled and now he does it non stop  
Then theres boyfriends 6 year old niece.  I love her dearly she is a sweet good girl but she is 6 and full of energy and FMIL has her over almost every Friday - Sunday and she is balls to the wall just touching everything, gets the dog riled up and comes into our room when I'm at work and takes things . 
I feel like I am a guest in my own home and I don't know how to approach or fix this. My boyfriend has spoken to her about these things and she has stopped the behaviors for now but how long will this last ? I just am so annoyed and regretting this . I know it's only temporary but my sanity is taking a hit ."
650,"SO and I have been given some more information about MIL and our wedding.

I'm going to backtrack a little, just for context.

SO's cousin informed us a couple weekends ago, after being told about the letter (in my previous post), that MIL said she wondered if she would still get an invite to the wedding. This says to me that she doubted her invite being there after sending the letter but still chose to send it anyway.

SO's best friend (who is going to be his best man) saw SO's cousin at work and they got talking. SO's cousin told SO's best friend that if MIL wasn't invited to the wedding, then she would ban people from coming to our wedding as well.

We laughed when we heard this.

We are going to invite everybody who we want to and we are going to let them know that we would love them to be there. SO is still going to ask his two brothers to be groomsmen and make it so clear to them that we want them at our wedding and would love it so much if they come. The invites are going to be addressed to the brothers directly and will be going to SO's nans house instead of the home.

My brother has even said he is more than happy to pick up SO's nan and brothers to make sure they get here.

We will try our hardest to have the people we want at our wedding.

Good luck MIL..."
651,"Background: MIL is a horrible toxic POS of a human being. Is currently ghosting her son for having previously battled depression, thinks I'm a gold digger for choosing to be a teacher, her and SFIL think I have a grudge against them and their family and have been driving to drive their son away from them since the beginning. 

DH has ""civilly owned"" their car forever, but she has refused to make it legal on paperwork, because me. 

So onto the UPDATE. We got a letter this week *cue Blues Clues theme*. It was from MIL. She actually mailed the signed vehicle title paperwork and said all that's left to do is take it to the DMV. Now, we haven't gone yet (DMV appts are a bitch to get here) so it remains to be seen whether this is actually going to work.

But in the letter she wrote ""Sorry this took so long sweetheart! See you at Christmas!"".

Um. Bitch, no.
1. We already have travel plans from the day after Christmas.
2. They live three states away and he (their son) gets like, 2 days off. 
3. I refuse to spend my Christmas with her, and I refuse to allow us to be separated on Christmas so he can give into her demands. 

SO says he'll go ""if they genuinely apologize to us both."" I think even if they apologize he shouldn't go. Because I think any apology at this point is simply a ploy to get what they want and not coming from any genuine place. 

Mostly just a vent at this point. I want her to stop fucking up our lives and mind her own business."
652,"Edit-thanks everyone for the incredible supply of sass and shut downs! It’s cheered me up reading all these, let’s hope I don’t have to use any, but I have some great ones just in case. 


Seeing my family next week. Please help me with comebacks to shut down weight related comments. They will likely be passive aggressive and under the guise of wanting to help (due to insane job and other life stress, I’ve put on a bunch of weight since my family last saw me-they don’t know why, but it’s hard to avoid looking how I do). My mom always pushes her weight loss pills on me!

One liners appreciated-though I don’t want to go on the attack. More looking to calmly shut it down. 

Thanks!"
653,"ETA: I just realized I wrote MiL when she’s in fact a Future MiL. Just thought I’d add this to help clear up any confusion. 

Hi I’m a first time poster and longtime lurker. Here’s the classic I’m posting from mobile and sorry for the formatting spiel.

My SO and I have been together for almost 3 years, and we’ve lived together for over a year. A good chunk of that year we lived with his parents so I could save money going to college (they lived closer than my parents). MiL was a jy until I moved in and I picked up on her jn behaviors.

I have many stories for other days but this one will be about MiL’s baby rabies. My SO and I are in our VERY early 20s. Like too young to financially old enough and responsible enough to have kids (not shaming people that do have kids at a young age).  Both of our parents had us later in their lives. MiL is from a huge family with many of the siblings being grandparents. 


Recently, the two youngest siblings have announced they will be grandparents. Their kids are SO’s and my age and one is still in high school. Obviously this has made something inside MiL awake and the rabies have been unleashed. She makes comments about how she’s going to die before she’s a grandma (she’s 57 but has many medical problems). We live in a tiny town so word spreads fast. Many people at the local gas station have said things about we need to make MiL a grandma. Her sister that lives in town also makes comments. She likes to make it more obvious to talk to babies/toddlers when we’re out in public. SO has an older brother that’s the gc but I think MiL has finally realized she’s not going to be getting grandkids from that train wreck. 

I guess this is more of a rant than anything, but any advice would be welcome. SO and I are on the same page about not having kids now. I mostly tend to ignore the comments about being an incubator. I just have a feeling when we finally do have kids that she’ll try to take over and make it about her. I’d like to say this is my only post but everyone here already knows that never happens. Thanks in advance!"
654,"I've been a lurker for a little bit but this is my first post. I was nervous about posting, but reading other posts on here has helped be realize it's not just me and that's a good feeling in the midst of the bullcrap. Sorry this will be a little long, but trust me I'm not even giving all the details.

I've been with my BF for 5 years. We met in college, so of course it wasn't all 5 years together non-stop. But we've come to a really good point. I moved in with him a little over a year ago and it's looking like marriage is the path we're on.

Insert his parents, mainly mom. The entire 5 years, she has had something to say about me, from ""I just didn't really like her answer to that question"" (when we first started dating his grandma asked what I liked about him and I said some typical at-the-time-19-year-old answer like he has nice hair and I like that he put me on to Star Wars). To ""you guys didn't look dinner-ready last night, she had sweat stains on her shirt; looked kind of dirty"" (this was in January of this year). I have anxiety, particularly in social situations, so of course I have internalized all of the things she's said over the years. And it especially bothered me that she would act all cool with me in front of my face then say these things to my boyfriend behind my back. Then expect me to be cool with her. I tried for a long time but I just couldn't anymore. I developed a coldness with his parents that was a long time coming.

It came to a head this summer when she texted us inviting us to their annual weekend at the beach. She specifically mentioned a game that, the last time we played, she had yet another ridiculous critique of me. So I said that I was down to go if my BF wanted to, but made sure to mention that I would not like to play that game but won't make some big fuss about it being played. You would've thought I told her to shove it. It turned into a whole conference with his parents where they were suddenly the victim and for the past few months I had been ""treating them like crap"" by purposefully not interacting and then that text was just so offensive. This is because a couple months prior to the text, my boyfriend told his mom that she needs to quit coming to him with her critiques of me and he told me she willingly admitted \*to him\* that she has been over critical, but refused to actually say that to me, instead saying ""that's just how I am."" The conference over the text ended with them saying that we should all just fake it 'til we make it but them swearing up and down that they have no issues with me.

Fast forward to now, I have been very very little almost no contact with them since that conference in July. I stopped by shortly after that to say hello to his grandparents (who are actually really kind to me) but left about 15 minutes later, and saw them at BF's cousin's gender reveal but wasn't all up in their faces faking it 'til I make it. I haven't been to their house for dinner, and his mom has stopped with her group chat to him and I with random articles. I, of course, have felt so much better and my relationship with BF has been better for it. 

But he has started expressing to me that he wishes I would come along with him around his parents more. He says he understands how I feel, but he had hoped that him telling his mom to stop gossiping about me to him would help me feel more confident in his abilities to not let the same things happen. He says that since the July conference they haven't said anything to him about me, other than one time they asked if I was avoiding and he told them no and kept it moving. We have a decent number of events coming up that they'll also be in attendance for, and then of course there are the holidays. My family is spread out all over the east U.S., so I'm out here with his family who all live close (his parents 10 minutes away, his brother goes to college close by, both sets of grandparents live only a few hours away, and even a good number of his friends still live in the area post-college).  It's not that I don't believe him, and I know I obviously cannot remain such little contact with his parents since they live so close, he interacts with them pretty regularly, and I want to marry him and have a future. But I'm trying to navigate protecting my feelings and taking the route I want to take with them, which is just ambivalence and being chill around them rather than their fake 'til we make it. 

Is that possible? Do I have to be all up in their faces and act like they're my second parents in order for them to lay off me? Am I being harsh to my BF by not giving him the opportunity to do the shiny spine thing? I feel like the upcoming events, like this coming weekend, will be a good enough test run."
655,"So not sure if this goes here but I'm hurting for my partner and need to share. My MIL is almost always JY, just the occasional issues that are more BEC than anything. 

Tonight my D(ear)H and I finally had a deep conversation about his drinking with an acknowledgement that there is an issue he needs help with. He finally told me the story of how he started drinking. 

When he was 18 his mother caught him smoking pot after a family hosted work  party. Instead of yelling, screaming, talking grounding, i.e. parenting, she instead bought him beer and told him to do that instead if he needed a ""distraction"". My DH was extremely introverted with almost no friends and spent his weekends drinking and watching movies and his parents just kept supplying the booze. There was no talk of moderation or responsible drinking leading to an issue with saying no and absuing it as a cure all 16 years later. 

I don't want anyone to think that I think he is blameless in this; I know he's not and he has taken responsibility for his actions and their consequences. It could just be the pregnancy hormones but my heart is just breaking for him right now, and I think I'm directing my anger at her as the catalyst. 

Thanks for reading.

Edit: spelling. Baby brain is real ya'll"
656,"My MIL is usually a JY, but with occasional cluelessness that makes her a JN. You can see from my post history she had some issues with SIL after she had a new baby, but we shut those down as a family and she was very receptive to what we were saying.

So receptive in fact that i didnt think id ever need to post here again.

But here I am! MIL messaged me recently asking what to get the kids for Christmas. This year I've asked people to not get any clothes/toys as both kids are all kitted out and ive just filled 2 bags with old toys the eldest doesnt play with anymore and I dont want to pass down to the youngest, due to them being damaged or ive heard the sounds too many times and cant risk listening to then for another two years and going insane.

Ive said, to either put money in their savings accounts or to spend the money on an experience with/for the kids, like take them to the zoo etc. That way they can spend quality time with the kids and my house isnt filled with crap, and bonus I can get some Child Free time every now and then or i can tag along to a lovely day out.

So MIL originally accepted this and has said sge wants to take the kids to an aquarium as the eldest loves fish tanks and and by the time Christmas comes round my youngest will be 6 months and at that stage of being fascinating by every thing so all in all a good plan and day out for the kids.

(I will just say i trust MIL with the kids unsupervised as she has never done anything with them without making sure im 100% okay with it. I count myself very lucky that she respects me completely as a mother, especially seeing some of the stories on here)

However MIL has decided she wants to do more, which is fine, if MIL wants to spend her money on the kids she can, I dont have an issue with that. But MIL wants to buy the furniture for the kids rooms as I've mentioned im going to decorate them for Christmas, we've only just moved in to this house and havent had the time/money to get things done however were back on even footing and i wanted to give the kids a nice space for both of them.

Queue MIL saying she wants to buy all the furniture for their rooms. My initial thoughts were, oh this is lovely, saves me money, gets the kids rooms done, what a nice gesture.

Typical JN fashion MIL has completely taken over the decorating process! I showed her all the furniture I wanted and the designs i was going for, for each room. 

We have a big playroom downstairs so I want their rooms to be a relaxing place with no toys and just for sleeping.

I want a cosy reading nook and then room for their drawers and new beds each. Single bed for eldest and a cot bed for youngest ready for him moving out of my room when hes old enough.

MIL disagrees on all aspects of this, has said kids just NEED toys in their room so they can plan instead of waking mum and dad up ????? Sorry but i want to get up in a morning and play with my kids?

She doesnt like the colour schemes ive chosen, thinks my daughter still needs to be in a cot depsite being in a toddler bed for the last 6 months and sleeping through. We tried her with a cot but shes a climber. She's said were trying to make her be more grown up than what she is, but she will literally not sleep in a bed with sides.

I've told MIL i dont want her to buy any furniture for the kids as it clearly comes with strings attached and isnt what I want for them.

MIL is now pouting saying she is just trying to help and save us money and doesnt understand why she cant get an input into their bedrooms as they're her grandkids and she knows what theyd like.

I know for a fact that if my daughter had one single toy in her room she'd stay up a night playing and would never sleep. I know because she used to have a teddy on the floor and she would just climb out of bed to play with it.

I just need to find a way to word this and get through to her that just because she wants to buy something doesnt mean she can control it? And that if thats the only reason for buying it i dont want it.

At the minute she just seems to feel like im being ungrateful."
657,"On mobile, can’t flair but advice is appreciated. Ongoing situation since it’s happening today. 

Today is YS’s wedding!! And Smellerella has already started her bullshit. So let’s go back to my wedding for a bit of backstory. 

Smellerella doesn’t ever wear anything appropriate. Like, I am all for wearing what you are comfortable in, but some situations things are inappropriate, like wearing a bikini top and daisy dukes to sign me out of school sick when I was in middle school. 

So I told Smellerella I had to approve whatever she wanted to wear at the wedding. She eventually shows me a lilac bridesmaid-style dress, circa mid 90s and we were in the 2010 years. She found it at a closing bridal boutique. It covered everything, was wedding-y, so I okayed it. 

Cut to the day of my wedding. Other bullshit occurred thanks to Smellerella, but that’s a whole post on its own. But Smellerella is missing, with my Aunt, her sister, who is a hair stylist and was going to do my hair/makeup. Did I mention my wedding was also the day of prom? So we scrambled to get an appointment (huge thanks forever and ever to my maid of honor!!), tipped very well to thank the salon for squeezing me around the prom queens (and telling them they had to wait for me! Bride &gt; queen. Love that salon), and got ready, got married, then went to the reception. We didn’t do family pictures, so the reception was the first chance I had to see Smellerella. 

She wasn’t wearing the lilac dress. 

She was wearing a blue and white tie-dye maxi. 

She and Aunt had gone out SHOPPING because, quote Smellerella, “I didn’t have anything to wear!” Aunt had bought her this dress. She apologized to me, but it was the nicest dress they could agree on. 

Cut to today, sister’s wedding. I am on Smellerella-wrangling duties. I found her a dress, ran it by her (along with several others). YS okayed all of them. It fits, looks good on her, etc. I’ve held onto it so nothing happens to it. But we are staying in a hotel on the other side of town, and with wedding run around, I don’t have much time to deliver. 

So I call eDad, explaining that I will be giving the dress to YS when we are decorating the venue, he needs to pick it up from her. She lives close to them, easier all around. 

As I’m giving him strict instructions to take care of the dress, he informs me that she has a back up. 

Record scratch. Wait, what?

Smellerella’s mom bought her a backup dress, in case something happens to the one I bought. Now, granted I don’t know her well, but I know her well enough, and either she didn’t know about the approved dress, or this is just a random dress she bought for Smellerella, and Smellerella has decided she wants to wear it to the wedding. 

I’m seething. She pulled this same shit at my wedding! And she hasn’t paid me for this dress either! I had to buy her a bra too because she doesn’t own one, and this dress necessitated one. 

Pass the red wine, I have a feeling I need to be prepared."
658,"My JNMIL is too weak to actually say what she means so she makes many attempts to just be a bitch. Here are some goodies.

*I ask when she and my JNFIL are checking into their hotel and when they are leaving. Her answer: “Checking in Friday and checking out Saturday. Why do you ask? Are we interrupting something?” 

*We are at dinner and I tell our families that the new baby’s first and middle name won’t start with a J (unlike my husband, my son, JNMIL and JNFIL). JNMIL says the baby will feel left out and will literally harbor feelings of resentment. WTF. 

*I ask JNMIL if she got a cake for her husband like she suggested. She says “No, I thought you were getting it” with a damn scowl on her face. She had text me that “we should get a cake” and I said “sure”. But apparently that was up to me to arrange. 

*We are hosting family for coffee and dessert after dinner. My JNFIL disappears to use our bathroom downstairs. I notice and ask why. JNMIL says as loudly as possible “YOU told US we were never allowed to use the upstairs bathroom”. We asked them once to use the downstairs bathroom when our LO was napping in the room right by the bathroom. Again with a shitty scowl on her face. She has used the upstairs bathroom plenty of times so she lies. Again. 

May the gods bring lots of snow for Christmas so that they can’t drive up and visit.

Update: Talked to husband after posting this. We are moving forward with a zero tolerance policy. If they (yep, both of them) can’t behave then they aren’t going to have an invite to visit us."
659,"I'm not really sure how to begin this, but here we go. I'm married to a lovely man with very shitty parents. His mother in particular is frustrating. Now I come from a not too great home environment; very narcissistic, emotionally abusive and over all toxic. When I moved to be with my husband (we were long distance for a bit before we got married), they were pleasant - offered to pay for wedding venues, did the big welcome into the family thing.

As time has gone on, I've begun to notice sadly familiar behavioir to my own parents. She's controlling, likes things her way or the highway and likes to tell big grand stories of family reuniting when really, she's driving us up the wall with her behaviour. We moved states along with his brother and his girlfriend, the latter two working at her restaurant. I've been helping out as a dishwasher when they're short staffed here and there.

Now, this is the problem in the shortest way o can muster. I have autism, and one of the things she enjoys to do is call people r*tards. She knows I'm autistic yet continues to do it, even to my face. I am super uncomfortable with it. She also yells and get passive aggressive with people and it kinda triggers my anxiety. She has also talked about me to the other co-workers that she doesn't have much faith in me ""being able to stick it out"", basically, specifically because of my autism. Does anyone have experience with dealing with this kind of situation, and what should I do?"
660,"Ok some back story... she’s not technically my in law,but my bf and I have been together for 8 years. My mother in-law has not been able to pay the rent for 8 years( her ex husband paid the rent for her until about 4 years ago) my BF and I have been paying the majority of the bills for the past 4 years. All the while she spends money on stupid nick nacks and signs to decorate the house with. I think she’s losing her mind bc she’s been extremely two faced and manipulative. She literally MAKES UP STORIES about me behind my back, telling my bf that I’m stealing money and sending “ thousands of dollars to my parents and siblings” 
Which is completely false. She went so far as to taking money we had saved up in a jar that was hidden near some of my things(bf put it there) and then comes to my bf saying “ I can’t hold this information any longer, I have proof she’s stealing from you!” Well her “proof” was that she took a picture of the money, took the money and then when my bf asked for it back she said no! “Tell me the exact dollar amount” 
We literally had to call police to come to the house, bc the proof that we had was that she had stolen it. 
Anytime I think she’s being nice to me and just having light small talk, she somehow twists and mangled what I say and turns it into some fabricated story to tell my bf about how I’m doing some thing terrible or wrong.  She says things like “I didn’t STEAL your money, I just TOOK it” she always goes back on her word, saying she never said things that she did in fact say. I used to try to be nice, I put together all of the patio furniture for her, I would buy little random things on occasion for her, I set up her huge heavy ass swing for her in the backyard and she never uses it. She has stepped all over us saying that this is her house, brought all kinds of people over to stay for months at a time costing us money, lack of sleep bc we don’t trust them around our things, and somehow I’m the bad guy(to her). She can’t even have a normal casual conversation with my bf if I’m present, she’ll throw a fit like a child. I don’t talk to her anymore, I avoid even looking at her because god forbid My normal face pisses off her royal highness. 
Last year, two days before my birthday, she tells my bf that I’m “doing things behind his back while he’s asleep”
Yes it’s true that sometimes he’s asleep before me. I have trouble winding down at night, so I’ll either do dishes, or smoke and browse reddit/9GAG/fb, w.e, the night before she says that to him, she comes out to me in the garage where I’m smoking and says she’s not feeling good blah blah. So I sit, I sympathize and I listen. Then I go to bed and the next day my bfs asking me wth she’s talking about. I tell him I have no idea, he asks her to clarify what she’s saying and she just tells him to ask me because I know. WTF!? So I tell him what I just told you, sometimes I browse Reddit or do dishes or go for a smoke. It blows over and then she says I do something else and the cycle continues. Now she keeps her door open and has moved her bed to where she sees the whole hallway with her door open, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells and I don’t know how to combat her craziness. 
I’ve talked about moving out with bf many many many times. And each time we dont end up moving because his dad is no longer alive to pay the rent like he used to and his mom isn’t able to pay the bills (btw his 40 year old jobless sister does nothing to contribute but lives with us and is treated like a princess by his mom) were 28, started a small business and are letting her drain us of our mental health and money. 

She’s just been diagnosed with cirrhosis, and we were supposed to move out of here next week. Somehow I have a feeling that isn’t going to happen. I absolutely Love and adore my bf, we’ve been through so much together and started a business together, but I feel like I’m at my wits end. I feel like I’m the crazy one. And now she has cirrhosis, and her gallbladder needs to be removed and like a million fucking  health problems. 
Am I wrong To still want to leave? If we do,we leave her in a tight spot. She gets social security and disability income, but I know that’s not enough to pay the rent and 40yr old lazy ass sister who is sweet but dumbbbbbb would have to step up to get a job and I don’t think that would happen. Fuck, I don’t even know what my question is anymore. I’m just so lost.
I could go on for hours the kind of shit she does. 
I guess in conclusion, how do I deal with her, and am I wrong to keep pushing to move out from “her” house even with her health and financial status the way it is?  My bf lost his dad 3 years ago and it still feels like yesterday, if something were to happen to his mom after we moved out I know he would blame himself for not staying by her side because he feels regret about not being able to have done something to keep his dad from passing so soon. 
I’m so sorry for the poor grammar and run on sentences, i don’t even know what I’m asking anymore. I just need some advice I guess? I don’t know anymore.

TLDR: my mother in-law is crazy and treats me and my bf poorly(IMO), is not in good health(diagnoses with cirrhosis yesterday),is manipulative, steals and makes up stories about me, but if we leave she can’t afford the house she’s in with lazy good for nothing sister in-law. Am I in the wrong? Am I the bad person? How do I combat such negativity, what do I do?"
661,"I’m afraid my FMIL is a JN 😐

Advice and opinions wanted! 

Hi everyone- I’ve been lurking on this thread for several months and I’m finally ready to post about my FMIL who started out totally JY but now appears to have JN tendencies. Buckle up because this is a LONG one, going to try to summarize as best I can. 

I just want to flag up front my fiancé and I have been together for two years and are  in the process of planning our wedding. He is the most amazing, supportive, patient, kind person I have ever met and he has backed me up 100% on all issues with his mom. I’m posting here because I feel badly that I keep complaining to him about his mom because even though he knows she can be very difficult I think it’s always hard to hear criticism of someone you love. 

When my fiancé and I met, we were both living in cities several hours apart. I met his parents pretty early into us dating as things got serious quickly. I loved his parents when I first met them. His mom was extremely kind, warm and welcoming to me. It’s important also to note I lost my own mother who I was very close to in my early twenties to cancer. I am a pretty open person and I wanted to build a close relationship with my future MIL and didn’t anticipate any issues. 

At first there were a bunch of uncomfortable moments but they were far enough apart that I just discredited them as one- off things. The first weird thing that happened when we were visiting them, she cornered me in the grocery store when fiancé went to get the car, asking me if I felt comfortable supporting and being the breadwinner for FH (at the time I made a lot more money than him, now i still make a little more but we are close to even). Having supported myself since college, my dad isn’t involved in my finances so I was weirded out by that. FH and I are 30 at this point. Later that weekend, FH told his parents at that end of that year he planned to move to my city to live with me, as there are better job opportunities in his field and also obviously we were tired of doing long distance. Mind you, he was only talking about moving a three hour drive from them and there a plentiful trains and flights to get here even faster. 

Well... she LOST it. She was hysterically crying, saying what had she done that her kids don’t want to live near her (FSIL does live on the other side of the country... I wasn’t aware it was my job to compensate for that). She started saying she and FFIL had been discussing buying a two family house in their city so we could all live together (what???? NO) and in general was just a complete emotional wreck. I felt bad and found myself comforting her but i was super taken aback by the reaction, especially since FH also has a ton of family in current city and it’s still very close to his parents. 

There were a bunch of other weird instances of her cornering me alone and talking to me about FH’s finances, I learned from her they were still paying a few of his regular bills (nothing crazy I think just phone and car insurance). He had recently switched fields professionally and was still getting his footing at the time/working his way up. They are very wealthy and had agreed (before I was in the picture) to temporarily help offset some costs. I told him to stop accepting money from them which he immediately did, as he was also annoyed she was somehow trying to undermine/ embarrass him to me and now this is no longer an issue. 

Now where things start initially went really south. FMIL is a certified doula, she is very passionate about her work and talks about it constantly. I mean CONSTANTLY, and often in very graphic detail. At first I kind of laughed it off because I figured it’s her life passion and she does do a lot of good and work with low income families etc. After only knowing her a few months, my sister and her fiancé got pregnant unexpectedly. Naturally, I asked FMIL for some general advice and suggestions since she does this for a living to pass onto my sister. She gave me a whole bunch of suggestions for birth classes, doulas and midwives in our city, baby books etc. she starts to tell me how horrible hospitals and drugs are and how TERRIBLE c sections are and how they need to be avoided at all costs. 
Mind you, My sister and her fiancé are both smart people and capable of making their own informed decisions. I passed along FMIL’s suggestions and my sister did some of the things but not all. Then every time I saw FMIL it was “did your sister sign up for the birth class I said? Did you get her a doula yet?” Which was overwhelming because I don’t control my adult sisters health decisions and while they were financially ok, they had not been planning for this pregnancy and didn’t have tons of extra money for all of these VERY EXPENSIVE things. FMIL would grill me every time I saw her and get visibly annoyed if my sister (who she had never even met) wasn’t doing everything she suggested. 
In the end, my niece was breached with the cord obstructing her getting into the right position and my sister ended up with a scheduled c section. I informed FMIL about this and she seemed actually mad at me, as if I had any control over this, making veiled suggestions that I had a duty to my sister to be our mom (or something) and that somehow I could have prevented this if we followed her advice. She was very aggressive about it and this whole upsetting conversation happened when FH was at work and i had stopped by to see them because I was visiting him that weekend. I was very nervous for my sister and of course we were both missing our real mom terribly so this crazy attack from here made me feel awful and I really did not trust her or want to share information with her after this.  She has since said to us multiple times that c section babies don’t get the right nutrient and that people who have c sections willingly “will need to deal with the consequences of their actions” ok.... 

After poor FH moved to my city but before we got engaged, sh*t hit the fan in a major way. My JY father was diagnosed with cancer (he is fine now). Given what we had gone though with my mom, this was horrifying and was taking a toll on all of us. My sister also had a very difficult c section recovery and then ended up back in the hospital needing to have another emergency surgery from the pregnancy complications. Between running back and forth between my dad, my sister and trying to help with my niece I was running on empty at this time and understandably very stressed out. 

In the middle of this, my FMIL and FFIL decide to come visit us for the first time in current city as FFIL’s extended family is having a big get together at their house. I spent the whole week cleaning our apartment and buying things they would like for when they came over the see our apartment.

FFIL hasn’t been mentioned yet because he is very JY, no nonsense person and does not intrude or step in with us like FMIL. I did learn early in our dating that FFIL had a serious drinking problem when FH and FSIL were teenagers (approx 15 years ago) and that he abstains from drinking and regularly attends AA. 
With that being said, they often keep wine/beer in their house and MIL enjoys wine frequently as do I. I had never been to their house for dinner or a party without being offered wine, no one in my family has ever had a drinking problem so I probably was naive about this but it didn’t seem like a big concern for them to be around alcohol and this issue seemed very far in their past.

So we go to the big party with FH’s extended family, the wine  was flowing and all of his cousins who work in a similar field to me were openly drinking a lot. I think a lot more people came to this party than they expected because they did not have enough food at all. I’m not proud of this but I definitely got drunk, I was exhausted and not been going out at all or drinking very often as a result of all of the things going on in my family. I did not cause a scene or do anything rude, but I was definitely tipsy  (as were several of DH’s cousins) and on the cab ride home with his parents I fell asleep on DH’s shoulder. I was not very proud of this but we spent the entire next day with my Future in laws and they said nothing about it so I figured we were in the clear. 

Fast forward 3 months, we are at FMIL’s house for the weekend with my own Dad because we were attending a party for my family in their city. FFIL is away for work. FH has told his mother at this point that he plans to propose to me the next weekend. We returned home from the family party and MIL asks if I would like something to drink as FH and my dad are enjoying a beer, I said sure I would love some wine. I had two glasses of wine and then we finished watching a movie and all went to bed. I certainly wasn’t drunk at all, I think maybe I was just a little more comfortable and outgoing because my own dad was there? 

In the morning, my Dad leaves as we had driven separately. That’s when FMIL breaks down in tears, sobbing that she thinks I’m an alcoholic, that it’s going to ruin our marriage (thanks for blowing the proposal surprise FMIL) and how when FFIL had a problem he endangered their kids and it almost destroyed their relationship. My FH and are I are stunned, we are young professionals living in a major city where social drinking is a regular part of our lives but we have no issues being responsible while doing so. I was offered wine by MIL, as I had been many times before, and aside from that one night that we were with her husbands own family I had never been drunk around them. She cried and accused me of having a drinking problem for an hour in their kitchen, it was absolutely horrifying. I was so embarrassed and shocked and felt awful, I apologized and we both tried to defend me against the accusations. She basically said it was my job to prove to her I’m not an alcoholic. 

She knew at this point that FH was planning on proposing the following weekend. It put a huge damper on the proposal and he ended up not inviting his parents to come and only included my family and friends. 

I told my fiancé I am never drinking around then or in their home ever again. We had very limited contact over the next two months and then went back for another visit for a holiday weekend. she repeatedly offered me wine which I declined (is she trying to trick me?). Also a few weeks before visit they tell us they want to throw a “last minute their city” engagement party for us at their house. It’s so short notice and over a holiday weekend so none of my family or friends could come. This put me in an awkward situation because obviously everyone there was drinking and celebrating my own engagement and I was trying to avoid drinking anything in front of then and was paranoid about being cornered again. I ended up caving and having a glass of champagne but the whole night was very uncomfortable for me. 
So reddit, do I in fact have a JN? She is coming to visit us this weekend and I’m already stressed and panicked. Help!"
662,"So my mother is so inconsiderate! There was a mass shooting yesterday in the town next to me. The same town that my husband works in. She sent me a text saying “mass shooting in town x” obviously I knew about it. No mention of my husband and checking to make sure he was ok. 
Flash forward to today. I just get another text from her sobbing about how she called me 3 weeks ago, but I never called her back. I didn’t, but we exchanged a text and a brief chat when I spoke with my father.  I can’t stand how everything is about her. 
My sister doesn’t return her calls, but she gets a pass because she works ... I too work. She calls my brother maybe every other month, he never reaches out, but I’m the horrible child because I’ve tried to go little to no contact because she makes me feel bad about myself every time we talk. 🤬"
663,"Sorry folks, I'm on a mobile.... also this could get long as I'll ramble as things come to mind.

So to preface this story ( I have tons that I can share if I fancy!), My SO and I have been together 5 years, we arent married, our stance is that we dont really need a big showy wedding or a piece of paper to show our love to one another. We also own a house, which they helped us with by giving us half of the deposit (which we have almost paid back).

When we were both introduced to one another she seemed to take an instant dislike to me. I will say that I was coming out of a toxic relationship, was very meek and apologised for everything. I had jelly for a spine! My spine has since gotten shinier but only thanks to the love and patience of my SO. But because I am quite 'soft' she believes i dont stand up for myself (not a huge fan of confrontation still).

Any who, over the years it seems to be constant passive aggressive or just plain aggressive remarks about our weight (we are both certainly a bit fluffier than when we first started dating),  the way we run our household, the fact that we dont have children yet even though JNMIL and JYFIL were both as old as my partner and I when they had my SO, she has this antiquated notion that I should be in the home cooking and cleaning and answering to her sons every whim instead of working (and honestly if I had to do that for any length of time I'd be looking for a good hole in the garden, not judging those who do but it's not my bag!). There really is a ton of 'helpful' advice commands that JNMIL gives and gets REALLY insulted when we dont do as she tells us.

The thing that bothers me, and has bothered me for months was our holiday. JNMIL and JYFIL live on the coast (we are from the UK). It's lovely in the summertime and really let's us both unwind and have some downtime. What seems to infuriate JNMIL is that we dont have concrete plans, as my partner has said, and bless his shiny spine, he goes there to see them (they wont visit us which is again another story!) Anything else we do is a bonus. The last time we went for the week JNMIL barely spoke to me, I dont think it was any more than a sentence the entire week. I was told I wasnt allowed to sit on her sofa as a friend of theres, who is 27 stone btw, sat on it and broke the protective bases for the feet, so my options are to stand for 4 hours at a time or sit away from everyone on a dining room chair then I get called unsociable for not being in the room with them. My SO HAS called her out for her behaviour but she sees nothing wrong, and gets offended and throws a major hissy fit. 

I have sat and talked with SO about what will happen if we holiday again, and spoiler alert its not going to be pretty, I am slow to react and quick to anger, it takes an unbelievable amount of bullshit for me to lose my temper but it is not pretty when I do. Bless his heart he supports me 100% and I would be lost without him, he doesnt show emotion (this is a childhood thing) but he will back me up at every turn when it comes to his mother!


SO is very much a mummy's boy but not to the freaky Norman Bates extreme, he can see and smell her bullshit a country mile away. I would never come between them but how do I explain to JNMIL how crappy she makes me feel without causing major ripples? How do I let her know that just because I dont have a relationship with my mother I dont need mothering? How do I get her to just.....stop?

Tl;DR - how do I get BattleAxe JNMIL to see me as her sons lifelong partner and treat me with a little respect?

I'm thankful for any advice even if it's to tell me I'm too sensitive! Ha!"
664,"My husband and I have been living at my mom's house for a little while. It's temporary. Her son died (my brother). We wanted to be here for her but we are going to leave soon to go traveling. 

My MIL has been extremely jealous that we have been living with my mom though. She has been traveling abroad for the past 1.5 years at our expense. Free flights, free food, free luxury accomodation in a very expensive country. 

She returned home about a month ago. We set her up with a place to stay and everything she needs. 

She's usually a meddling, tantrum-throwing control freak but she has been acting completely innocent and almost too nice. I was happy but my instinct told me something was going on. It's never simple with her. 

Anyway, while we get her new place painted, she's been staying with us at my mom's house. She is in her bedroom all day, eating freely, watching Netflix, never cooks, never offers to help around the house. We were fine with it. At least she was not getting in the way. 

Turns out the niceness was an act and the entire time she's been going behind our backs and playing victim with people. Relatives are apparently very angry at my SO and I because we are ""mistreating her and not doing our duties to her."" 

She is playing poor little old lady who was dumped by her son to and forced to live in isolation all by herself while we live with MY mom and favor her. 

She's 60 years old, does not need medical help, in decent health, can take care of herself, should still have hobbies, friends and interests. Heck, she could still work if she wanted to but we don't expect her to. 

We are not choosing my mom over her. We are leaving the country in a few months and it makes no sense to move in with MIL and then pack up all over again to store our things back at my mom's place (she has space for our stuff). 

We give her literally everything. I don't know ANYONE who gets to travel 2 years abroad for FREE (she did two separate rounds of lengthy travel without spending a cent of her own - a total of 3 years). She stopped working a decade ago and we've been paying her way since then. 

She manipulated us before into living with her after her husband died 12 years ago ""she needs someone to be the man of the house"" she's a little helpless old woman - that man happened to be my man (her son). 

She spends small amounts of her own money and then tells us to reimburse her. She wanted new curtains recently and bought it then demanded we reimburse her for it. 

When she wants something she doesn't ask, she tells.

My mom is her age and still working 8am til 7pm. She feels bad to ask for money and is ever grateful when we help her with money. 

MIL on other hand, believes she's entitled to it while giving absolutely nothing back. Not even a cooked meal and definitely not a thank you.

We do a lot for her and cover all her expenses and now that my husband and I are finally doing something WE want to do, she's painted a picture of ""poor little old lonely lady abandoned by her children"" and people are ragingly mad at us.

We didn't even know about this until someone came forward to let us know what was going on. 

She sold her victim card so well that relatives are looking to build her a house next to their own so she won't be alone and to save her from us - her abusive, neglectful son and daughter-in-law.  

It is extremely hurtful. She uses us to get everything she wants and when we say no to anything, she goes around playing victim and rallying up support and hatred toward us. She does it in such a sly way that she ignites an emotional reaction from others while saying things like ""oh no, don't be angry at them. I love my children and I don't mind what they're doing."" 

She gets a response like ""no! It's not right. Your son is doing you wrong! This is just wrong. You deserve better.""

I swear, she's evil as fuck. I'd rather deal with a crazy person that's openly crazy than deal with this manipulative shit that she does. My father was a drunk, physically abusive man but at least it was ""what you see is what you get""...

TL; DR; MIL plays victim card so well that she has the world raging at us. It hurts since we do so much for her without even getting a thank you."
665,"**TW: mentions of violence**
So I don't write about my JustNoMom often, she isn't constantly causing issues for me. This week the full moon was out and she her crazy returned. For those unfamiliar with her, a brief explanation is that she is both physically and mentally abusive and I moved out of her house a few years ago when I turned 18. I am currently living with a supportive family friend who knows my situation well. I've basically gone VLC, as NC isn't the best viable option. Not taken any legal action yet, but I am keeping anything that might potentially help me do this in the future if I feel like I need to.

 *also I know some of my irl friends know my account now, I'm not nuking this and erasing everything I have documented, you know who you are and honestly its up to you to read anything I've posted. I don't care. Yall supportive anyways, and know about this shit.*
________________________________________________________________________

A few days my mother, nicknamed Jane the Ripper (JTR) messaged me yet again. I've not replied to this, nor do I intend to. After she realized I wasn't responding she tried to love bomb me by sending multiple heart emojis, and a gif that says ""I love You!"". Not replying to that either though. 

[Most of her wonky message, minus most of the &lt;3's and gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/tn9uuN1)
For anyone that might not want to click on the link, the basics of the message is her incoherent rambling about how I have had my mind polluted by my roommate, which has caused me to hate her because we used to have such a good relationship. She is also accusing me of telling people I have no parents, and riding on bikes with people. Yeah I don't get that last bit, as neither has actually happened. I've been living in my neighborhood for a number of years, and the people who know me also are very aware of who my mother is. Also I don't rent Lime bikes, and so I don't ride them so I'm curious to know where she's got that from. 

At this point I think her brain is pretty much shot, and I'm not entirely sure if she's able to determine what's real and whats not. There's not much I can do besides call the police to conduct a wellness check. Any time I've seen her in person the last few months she has been relativity normal, she doesn't act odd. She doesn't speak like she does in texts, she is capable of forming coherent sentences. I honestly just want to keep my distance from her, I don't feel like I can help her and I know very well she doesn't want my help. 

Her mental facilities have definitely decreased in the last five years, though I know this is because of she has permanent effects from cancer treatments give years ago. (I can guarantee she had cancer, it was not a scare nor her faking it. I spoke with doctors and she did legitimately head towards death door during this time.) Doctors told me the radiation might have caused her to have memory issues, otherwise known as cancer brain. She's improved since her treatments but has never been the same. She also told me about a year ago that she had a mini-stroke, but I'm not entirely sure if that was a lie or not. Its possible but I don't know nearly enough about that to really say.


Jane the Ripper thinks she has a secret ""flying monkey"". There's this one neighbor whom I don't speak to, because honestly he creeps me out for reasons I'm not going to get into. After I went vlc with JTR he started actively trying to speak to me when he saw me in public. I've entirely grey rocked him, except in one case where I made the choice to not allow some shit. See JTR and her Boyfriend are telling the neighborhood they're legally married (except I don't think he's even legally divorced from his ex wife) and that all along he's been my biological father. I've had multiple neighbors as me about this, including this man. Each time I have told the truth and said ""No, he is not my biological father they just want me to begin treating him as such. My father is x, and has been dead for many years now."" Technically the man I call my biological dad is my adoptive father, but my mother had many partners when I was conceived so it doesn't matter. I know this male neighbor thinks of himself to be a good friend of JTR's boyfriend, and I know anything I say to him will be relayed to them. I don't exactly care that they're aware I'm calling them out for lying, I've said the exact same thing in front of both of them before. 

I know she has this delusion that we were the best of friends growing up, but it doesn't help that she never actually acted like a mother rather than infantalized herself and had me parent her. I've given stories about that in the past though. I'm not her best friend, I don't want to hear all the issues she has as she gets blackout drunk. I hate the double standard that I'm supposed to take care of her when all she did for the most part do the bare minimum taking care of me. She'd have moments where shed try to buy my love with gifts but that's not the same. 


She loves to blame my roommate for ""corrupting me"" and making me hate her. In reality I've not held much love for her in a very long time. When I was a minor I put up with her, I put on a face and tried to act like a good daughter. I may have loved her at that point still but the day she chose her drug addicted/dealer boyfriend over her own daughter decimated anything left. My roommate offered me the chance to have freedom from JTR, and I took it. I don't regret that choice for a second and JTR couldn't pay me all the money in the world to return. 

She seems to forget that neighbors are gossipy and I hear all sorts of stories about what her and her boyfriend still get up to. How he's cheated on her, that shes been heard down the block screaming at him, that she's seen all the time throwing things at him. That if I were to walk by their house I guarantee half the time there's a fight going on. Every single time I have seen her these past months she has been covered in bruises of varying sized. She even had one that practically covered her entire forearm. I know that calling the police won't help, she will lie to them like she always does and says its fine. She refuses to leave the relationship, shes been given multiple opportunities to. I know that those in abusive relationships struggle to break free but shes also just as guilty of being abusive. I know she hits him too, I know she berates his worth and capabilities constantly. She refuses to date men with real jobs (ie anything not drug dealing related), anyone who wont hit her back because she literally thinks their too boring.

I still have scars from seeing that type of stuff when I was a little kid, and when I experienced it in my teens it was like I was transported to the cowering three year old just wanting the yelling to stop. She lies like its nothing, there's no remorse or hesitation. I still cant exactly understand how a person can be capable of doing that. I'm not naive enough to think no one lies but I struggle doing so and I cant imagine doing it so casually like she does.


She's trying to use my old dog against me, as a weapon to make me come back for him. I don't think she'd purposefully hurt him, but she's not a good dog owner overall and doesn't control him. He bites people, attacks other dogs if given the chance, goes to the bathroom inside, begs for human food and she even gives him human food all the time. Honestly, he's become a violent dog and perhaps it might be better if he were to be put down. I'm surprised that no one has reported him to animal control for being a violent pet, and I don't have the heart to. He's very small, very fat, and I don't think hes a real threat. He's primarily a chihuahua sized asshole that has the same little man complex attitude. I had to abandon him at my mothers house, though she had already forced herself into the role of primary caretaker by the time I moved out anyways. See, I was mean for not giving him chicken nuggets from fast food joints or pieces of greasy bacon and instead wanting him to eat the amount of dog food the vet recommended. Heck given the chance that little dog would eat till he exploded.  

Anyways, I needed this rant to be honest. It's a lot of repetitive stuff I've likely posted before, but its helpful in its own little way. She's gotten up to other stuff besides this but that's a post of its own. Dissecting her text was enough for me emotionally today."
666,"About a month ago, I was visiting my in-laws. I had recently got my gums contoured (something I had been wanting to do for years and was super excited about) and I was showing them the results. We talked about the procedure for less than a minute, and them moved on to other subjects. Five minutes later, my mother-in-law goes up to me and says ""let me see your smile again"". I smiled wide feeling confident in my smile. She looks at me and says ""now all you need to do is get your lips done so that you can have a nice smile"". Confused and completely taken by surprise, I tried to laugh it off. I told her that I didn't want to get my lips done and that I liked my lips the way they were. This was true - I had never considered lip fillers and I never thought that my lips were that small (they definitely aren't big but they also aren't that small). She then said ""No really you need to get your lips done, they're too small"". I froze - I didn't know what to say. My husband, who was also taken by surprise just started saying how he liked my lips. She replied that I should really at least get filler in my top lip because it really just was too small. Then my husband told her that she can get lip filler is wanted and her and my father-in-law started talking about how nice her lips were naturally and that she didn't need filler which made me feel even worse.  
We left a couple minutes afterwards. The second I got out of the door I started bawling. Being a relatively confident person, I was surprised at my reaction. I was completely heart-broken, and humiliated. I was used to her commenting about my looks (saying that I am too pale, telling me that I'm too skinny, telling me that I have acne), but this was different. I didn't know how a person could just look at me in the eyes and tell me I need to change my face - especially someone that hasn't had any cosmetic procedures done herself.

The next day, I made a decision to brush it off. My in-laws acted as if nothing happened so I did too. But that night, I noticed that I developed all these new insecurities. When I look in the mirror, I focus on my lips. When I take pictures, I focus on my lips - an insecurity I never had before. Throughout this month, instead of my frustration towards my mother-in-law going away, it has gotten worse and worse. I get an instant head-ache and anxiety just from being around her.

I'm so upset that she made me feel this way, but I don't want to be upset. She hasn't even apologized. My husband just acts like she doesn't know better and that she doesn't mean to hurt my feelings but I don't know why someone would say that to another person. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm overreacting, if I'm too sensitive. I don't know what I can to feel better about it and let it go."
667,"Today was supposed to be my relaxation day with SO.  Instead he told me yesterday that we are spending the day with JNMIL. OUT OF TOWN. I will list the bad and the good. It’s been very mixed. 


Bad: 
Constantly repeating everything she says because she thinks we didn’t hear her and she needs the attention of a dramatic response. A cop drove by with his lights on; she did not stop only moved out of the way and complained about him saying “I GAVE YOU PLENTY OF ROOM” and again repeating herself when I didn’t agree that there was no reason for her to pull over completely. Kept complaining about other family members to us. Constant bragging on herself for all the good she’s done for her family. Made me ride in her car so I wouldn’t have an escape of my own.  Was upset that the KFC people didn’t recognize her by name. 

Good: 
She paid for breakfast. She told SO she is getting him a coffee machine for Christmas (although she said so after she heard me tell him we don’t have the space or need for one since neither of us are avid coffee drinkers).  Bought wrapping paper for us, even though I told her we could pay for it. 


The day isn’t over yet but I am drained. I just want to go to sleep. It feels like she’s holding me hostage because every time I think we’re going home she finds somewhere else to stop."
668,"A little bit of back story. I recently gave birth at 31+1 a few weeks ago. During my pregnancy they discovered my cervix was shortening and at 22 weeks, I had an emergency cerclage placed. I was put on bedrest until I went into preterm labor. My MIL had already been a small nuisance like telling everyone our news, literally within 24 hours of knowing and making it all about how she's going to be a grandmother, saying she's going to throw a baby shower for me and I can't plan any of it ( I wanted a jack and Jill baby shower as I can't stand ones with just women but that didn't happen and I had also asked to have it earlier since I was at risk for preterm labor and ended up having it 2 weeks postpartum.)

So on to the real issues I'm having. We let people come to see my son a few days after he was born, even though I didn't want to but my DH was more open to them coming. Things quickly changed when my son got sick from the fortifier and had blood in his stool and had his feeds stopped for 2 days while just on IV fluids. Neither of us got much sleep as he was very hungry still and any time the soother fell out of his mouth he would cry so I was up every 10-15 minutes at times trying to fix it for him. My MIL had respected our rules before then which were, schedule with us when you will come, no posts on social media, only three people at a time, and no one touch him. 

She decided on her own to ask her work to relocate her for 1.5 weeks to our city to ""help"" like taking me to and from the hospital so I can sleep and taking me out to eat or get out of the NICU so I'm not stuck here all day everyday. When she got here though, there was never any mention of doing any of this and she ended up taking other family out and just came to visit at the NICU. When she would come it would be longer visits, sometimes over an hour so I had little time between pumping to act human like eat, shower, sleep, get water, etc.
 When my son started getting sick mid way through the week and texted me and just said ""I'm going to come after traffic dies down."" No asking just stating. I told her it wasn't a good day since my son was sick and I was exhausted. She said okay and I thought that was that. 
She then starts texting my husband and then calls him when he's at work. He tries to explain he can't really talk as he is at work, but she just kept pestering him about seeing the baby and asking why he was being an asshole not letting her see the baby. All she can do is stare at him at this point and take pictures but I digress. 

So at my baby shower she corners me and starts talking about my husband and her fight. Again mentioning how she changed her work schedule around to be here yada yada. I want to say ""Well you never communicated with us or we would have told you to wait since there's not much you can do, and if he's sick, he's sick and that's the end of it"" but I just listened, said it wasn't a great way to communicate, and tried to just brush it off as she mentioned she would have to talk to him when the stress dies down.... Ha. 
My husband thinks she did this because she thinks I have control over him and that she can just pressure me into getting what she wants. 

The next thing she has done is we asked for only 3 visitors at a time as our room is small and the more people who are in it raises my anxiety like crazy. Even if it's the doctor's and nurses during rounds it still stresses me out when we have 7 or 8 people in the room with the incubator, now crib. So the night before last, I had been stressing about them coming for a visit and got maybe 3 hours of sleep. I still agreed to let them come as I didn't want drama and she will be returning home Monday so let her have this one was any initial thought to keep the peace. When they show up, they also bring the GMIL and StepGFIL. 

(Side note: recently we moved from a small apartment into a house our MIL is renting.  Stepgrandfather had offered to help us move our stuff a month in advance since he had a truck. 2 weeks before the move he helps you move some of our larger stuff, but we still ask if everything is good and again 3 days before the move and he says it's okay. Then the day of he says he can't. His grandmother calls DH arguing about how he could expect them to remember and just plain BS. Even if we weren't in the NICU a week after giving birth at this point and trying to handle just the move, this was a shitty thing to do. So we had to rent a truck and I had to help my husband for a few days instead of resting and pumping and taking care of my son. It was during this time that the MIL had asked to visit as I mentioned before. I was still exhausted from the back to back days of long visits and trying to recover from childbirth.) 

So when they come to visit MIL, StepFIL, SIL they also bring GMIL, and StepFIL without asking (my assumption is they know they fucked up, we have gone NC with them before so they got MIL to bring them as they probably assumed they couldn't come) and now there are 5 people, plus my husband and I. My rules were wash your hands and put on a gown to cover your clothes. The guys did not, which pissed me off as they got right of next to the crib ( I disinfected the crib as soon as they left). When they all had walked in I had said ""This is a lot of people all at once"". MIL ""We just wanted to see the baby."" 
Firstly that just tells me, fuck me and my rules what they want is more important than the safety of my child and what I need. Secondly, who the fuck brings extra people even if visiting at home instead of the hospital. Thirdly, I am very close to just snapping at MIL as this boundary stomping is getting on my last nerve. 

DH and I spoke after and we are thankfully both in the same page. Visits at the hospital stop as everyone has seen the baby. No one will be visiting us at home until April at the earliest since it will be flu season and RSV season. People could not have symptoms and be contagious and put him at risk which would mean coming back to the NICU after release. Fuck that I am not putting my poor baby at risk just because they ""are faaaammmiiillly and want to see the baaabbbyyyy."" No one will see him, I will be able to have alone time with my baby at home and no one will interfere. 

My husband and I *know* there is going to be drama. When they were leaving SIL(11) said she can't wait to kiss the baby. I said ""No"" and my MIL said ""Oh, well when he comes home"". My nurse was right there and chimed in saying ""No it's not safe to kiss the baby, his immune system is not developed enough"". That shut her up but I know that's not the end of it. 
We can't go NC as she is our landlord, but she is going to push us away and play the victim but I am tired of being nice. I am going full Momma bear if she tries to do what she has in the past, sweet to my face but manipulate and think I'll just roll over as I'm ""so sweet"". Bitch this ""so sweet little girl"" you think I am is going to show you how loud and nonbs I can be. Any advice to tell her to fuck off would be appreciated. I am so done with my In-laws."
669,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeautic at this point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Rewind back to 2013-2014. I was pregnant with my first child. I'd had miscarriages before, but nothing had ever ""stuck"". I was tired of being bombarded daily with emails and letters so I allowed TP Patrol out of her latest (year long) time out. She'd been put in there because she'd announced to all the world, my family, friends, and the book of faces that my previous miscarriages were ""fake pregnancies"" because, well, I didn't want my mother at the doc appts and such. And of course, if you were REALLY having a miscarriage you'd need your mother. So, I had a lot of people who thought I was faking pregnancies because, why would my own mother lie?

This was the biggest mistake ever. My mother basically frog marched me in the OB's office. I wasn't allowed to be alone in a room with me or DH only, because ""she's my mother"" and ""she needs proof I'm ACTUALLY pregnant.""

&amp;#x200B;

And so set the tone for my whole pregnancy. She'd 'escort me' within a foot of my body at all times in the OBGYN. Wouldn't leave while I made the next appt. Would put it in her phone and save it. Threw a hissy fit when I asked for her to not come and let my aunt come to an ultrasound. She's not my mom, why does she need to come? NO! Threw a hissy fit when i told her DH and I wanted to be the only ones at the anatomy scan. She's waited her WHOLE LIFE TO BE A GRANDMOTHER and now I'm ruining it. (Joke's on her. I paid for a private ultrasound to find out the gender a month before she found out and invited my aunt!).

&amp;#x200B;

Then there was the naming process. Oh, dear holy Satan, the naming process.  wanted her to have a middle name of (old school, classic name that I later used on my second daughter) after a beloved aunt (dad's side) or Charleigh (which I didn't ever use and never will so it's fine) and she wasn't having it. She had said this concerning it, and I was literally thinking so hard on it, I had to go look it up in my emails. (She also threw a hissy fit about wanting to be called ""Nana"", aka my dad's mother's name, who died when I was 18 and my mother HATED with a royal passion. I said NO.) 

&amp;#x200B;

"" ""So I can't have your baby call me what I really want but your dad can. Your calling her a name that people will be associating her with a womanizin older drunk drug using man, or after your aunt that sounds like an old woman name instead of a prissy diva type name like she deserves. Nothing I say around ya'll is correct, I get put down on. I am trying so hard to do better. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm walking on thin ice around ya'll. yes, she is your baby but why can't me as your mom be able to say something without getting punched in teh gut. As your mom I did everything Possible to protect you from anything I thought could hurt you. I still will. Your going to be her mommy and it's your job to protect her and as her grandmother I should be able to have feelings about things in her life and not get treated like crap. I'm tired of being hurt. It's really taking a hard toll on me. I love you to death. I have always treated you like a lady and done everything in my power to keep you happy. Can you and DH just try and give me some kind of respect? Please I do at least deserve that."" 

""I told you at 1st that I didn't think it was a good idea to name her that. But to make you happy I said what I did. That's called Love. But yet I still think it's a mistake because well it just IS. But opening your eyes to how things come from ya'll to me, like the name I've always wanted to be called is what I was doing too. By making the choice of calling her ""Charleigh XXX"" anybody that knows two and a half men will always be a kick in the gut to her. She will always be picked on! By calling her name that include Aunt's Name is a kick in my gut again and again because I gave birth to you, not aunt. I deserve that respect, not aunt  or even your grandma. Just because  spends money on you all the time doesn't make her love you like me. She never will. I'm not saying to name her after me. I'm just saying it hurts enough that I haven't had respect from you in years. And i'm going to be a grandmother, a real true grandma, and I should be able to say what I want about names whether it makes a difference or not.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then we came to the birth. A scheduled c-section (Which she threw a HISSY fit in the OBGYN's office about because she NEEDED me to feel real labor and that FEELING since she'd never done so?).

threw a fit because DH was going to the OR with me vs her. She told me she loved me for the first time in 22 years minutes before I was going in the OR, just so I could see how much she needed to go in there more than DH.

&amp;#x200B;

threw a fit because DH went and got me take out instead of me eating hospital food during my 3 day stay. I should suck it up, and stop being a picky eater.

&amp;#x200B;

Said she was coming to stay with us for a week to help, because DH had literally never changed a diaper, and I just had a csection. Threw a fit because DH wanted to change diapers (and learn!). Implied that he was ""inappropriate"" and I needed to ""watch him"" for signs of ""inappropriateness"" because ""normal dads"" don't change diapers. Implied I didn't want the baby because DH was spending any time with her.

After that fit (this was the 2nd night of being home) insisted that the two of us just go in our room and get some sleep and let her have the baby. I was out of it because I was tired of refereeing the bullshit so we did. DH shut our bedroom door to keep the dogs out. When we woke up the next morning she had complained to all of our family, fb, etc... That we ""made her a slave"" and we just went in the room and shut the door instead of listening for our OWN BABY. I told her that was a lie. She blew up saying any mother that can go to sleep with the door closed and not listen to their own baby needs mentally committed. I told her to get the hell out of my house. So she left. And because she'd pitched a fit that she and only she was going to stay and help that week after I got home-DH had to go back to work and I got to pop a few stitches trying to navigate new mom-ness by myself after a c-section. It was super fun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've had two kids since DD1, but she's met neither of them. She messaged me shortly after DD2 was born to tell me (she was cut off already) that ""she looked just like TPP"". She didn't even know about DS until he was 11 weeks old. That was the best pregnancy/birth ever. I also lost a baby 11 months ago at 17 weeks pregnant. She sent me emails to ""stop faking pregnancies and losses"" after I posted about how difficult it was to pick up his ashes from the funeral home and someone expressed their condolences to her.. So that was fun."
670,"I'm engaged, planning on getting married next fall to my fiancee. We want something very small, we have a guest list of 11 people and we want to wear clothes we already own (when we first met she was in a suit and I was wearing a white dress). We have a mutual best friend who is helping us design custom rings, and we want a short ceremony where we just sign the certificate and we're done, followed by a meal at our favourite restaurant.

My parents transferred me £10,000, and her parents did the same. We did not ask for this.

We both called our parents and explained that we were fine for money, but they said it was a ""wedding gift"", so we thanked them and agreed with each other to put both amounts it in our ISA.

MIL wanted to know how we were doing the outfits and we told her that I'd be in a dress and Fiancee would be in a suit. She has spent 2 weeks trying to convince Fiancee to wear a dress so she will look ""pretty"" for the wedding. Every time either of us has tried to say we'd already chosen our outfits and explained why she insisted that we both had to buy wedding dresses.

My parents, meanwhile, have been nagging both of us about our guest list. We said small and intimate from the start but they've given me expanded guest lists, which includes cousins/uncles/aunts I've never even met. When we tried to reinforce the ""small and intimate"" aspect they brushed us off.

We met both sets of parents for lunch earlier. They said that there was a miscommunication and the money from her parents was actually a ""dress budget"" for both of us, meant to only be used on dresses, and the money from my parents was for ""the guest list"" so it was meant to cover venue and catering for an expanded guest list.

We both went away from the table to talk. We discussed it and agreed that the money wasn't worth it, so we brought up our banking apps and transferred the money back. Then we went back to the table, sat back down, and told them what we'd done.

They responded that we were acting like children, and we said that we wouldn't be told what to do. My mum and my future mother in law promptly burst into tears, and both fathers looked pretty angry. They told us that the money was meant for us, and we said that we wouldn't accept anything from them that came with strings attached. We repeated that we had all wedding elements, including our outfits and guest list already decided. We said it was final and we wouldn't be taking suggestions, to which they said we were being unfair by not giving them a say. We then thanked them for the meal, put down a £20 each (our meals came to about £15) and left without another word.

We felt justified at the time, but since then we've both gotten messages from our siblings, saying that we were rude to our respective parents when they were just trying to do something nice, and now we feel like we went too far. Did we?"
671,"It’s been a while. And while mostly his mom stayed far far away and I only heard second hand her bullshit through my SO, I HAD to deal with her because our oldest DS1 has his birthday party this weekend. There’s kind of a lot to go over so I’ll be as short as possible.

I have to start with her Facebook post about DS1 on his birthday. I didn’t really care, whatever, until I realized she made one for him and NOT DS2, which brought up the whole “when are you getting a paternity test?” Bullshit she would ask SO all the time. I brought it up to SO and he basically told me not to get mad and that his “mother isn’t the smartest of people, sendsomechips, idk why you let t bother you.” Okay. Fine. Whatever.


I also have to mention how SO recently told me she said she raised our first son. LIVID, I AM STILL LIVID she would say that. My son staying with her during the weekend and her buying him clothes and toys from time to time is not raising a child. Giving a tablet to play with all day while you watch tv is not raising a child.


His father came back from work (he has a job that requires him to travel to different cities for extended periods of time). We went out to eat with him and SO’s older sister who was also in town, and he brought up how Seagull was asking him for $400 for groceries. SO remarked how that’s weird considering everytime we go she only has eggs and her yogurt drinks. I threw in how we have to go and buy enough food for the weekend, which is a pain in the ass, she knows we’re coming, but doesn’t buy food, so we have to buy more and then while we’re at the store she asks us to buy her shit too, like beer or cigarettes. Or both. 


We get to the house and she’s asleep thank god. The next day, I have to go to the store because OF COURSE there is nothing. As I’m getting my stuff to go of course she says “can you get me an esponga?” Which, for all you non Spanish speakers out there literally translates to me in my SEVERELY LIMITED Spanish means sponge. 

“A sponge?”

And then SHE LAUGHS in front of my SO and his father saying “no, I mean the pan dulce (sweet bread) the one that looks like a turtle shell.”

Me: “a CONCHA???” 

Her: “yes.”

During this exchange my SO says that some people call it an esponga and some call it a concha, by I was just annoyed because I know how this bitch plays, she knows I don’t speak Spanish and this is just one of her underhanded ways to try to make me feel stupid. 

I go and get the supplies, and her stupid concha, and come home and make enough food for everyone, including her annoying ass who’s literally coughing everywhere with her mouth uncovered. Then she asks SO to help her with her passport form even though her husband (they’re still debating a divorce and not sleeping in the same room but still) is sitting right there. He tells her he has a bunch of stuff to do that day, and we did: decorations,balloons, a gift, cake, plus the drive is like 40 minutes away to the party hall. I say “if you make an appointment they will help you fill it out correctly” 

Her: “it’s because I get so confused.”

You mean you get confused by the line asking where you were born and place of employment? Your email? Your date of birth? Yet I turn around while making food and there’s the SO filling out the shit out. All I can hope is that she doesn’t think she’s coming with us next year on our trip, because fuck that noise. Absolutely not. 

We finish breakfast and I’m waiting for my SO to be done getting ready so I can bathe the kids and get ready. I’m in the living room with the kids and she comes in.

Her: “can you send me the address of the place where the party is?”

Me: “sure.”

I had absolutely NO intention of sending her the address and I didn’t because 1) she knows where it is and 2) she can google it and 3) she’s not my mom, she can ask her son give her that information. 

Of course before we leave she asks her son for the address and he asks me if I have it to her and I say, “no”. So then he sends it to her. In the car he asks why I didn’t and I say, “it’s called fucking Google. She can google it. Is she stupid?”

“That’s my mom.”

“And? Like I’m supposed to just get over how she’s treated me all these years?”

“So it’s fair game now on each other’s moms?”

“Pfft. No it’s not. Has my mom ever been so outwardly rude to you? Has she ever said half the shit your mom has said about me?”

No answer. We get to the party and we’re early, so we set up and over all it’s a good time. All the kids had fun, he got great gifts, it was great! She separated herself and left early, but I don’t care. I’m hosting a party, not a play date between adults and I absolutely don’t have to cater to her or her needs.

We get home and look at our sons big gift, he had gone to my moms house to play, and leave to get him with the baby. While at my moms I get a text saying she drank my beer. This is when I went from molding annoyed to absolutely livid. At first I thought he was joking, but I get home and my beer is just half empty sitting on the counter. My SO comes in and asks what’s wrong.

“What do you think?”

They come inside and she gives some bullshit excuse saying she didn’t know it was mine, which is absolute bullshit, and I’ll tell you why. Everytime we come, we buy beer because we only imbibe in the weekends. We also get craft beer, and my SO always gets me one or two tall boys of a red beer. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO DRINKS THEM. Her husband doesn’t drink, she only drinks Stella’s, she doesn’t speak to her daughter so she has no idea what or if she drinks, and the craft beer is for my SO. OBVIOUSLY ITS MINE. And if she didn’t know it was mine, ASK. My SO tells me to take his card and go buy myself another. No. I’m not going to get back in the car and drive to get myself more beer. All I wanted was to come home and have my beer and go to sleep. Then she offers to drive me to get it. NOT BUY IT, JUST DRIVE ME to get it. I say no. I’d also rather not be in a car with her, because I cannot fucking stand her. 

I can’t even go to bed because I forgot to dry my clothes. My SO keeps looking at me and I’m not looking at him because I’m furious and he’s doing nothing, and doesn’t see why I’m so pissed. She does this shit to undermine me and disrespect me on purpose. I end up drinking my SO’s last two beers and on my last beer it’s just me and him in the kitchen and he tells me she tried to fix it after an “honest mistake” so basically I should just stop being mad. I tell him it’s more than that because it is, and he tells me I can finish my beer alone because he doesn’t want to be around me while I’m having a attitude. 

And that’s where my day ended. I don’t know how to word to him all  of this without seeming like I’m making a mountain out of a molehill, or like it’s nothing or I’m acting like a baby. I’m also super disappointed my SO didn’t just take my side. He knows how his mother is. 

What do I do?

Update: since this morning I avoided talking to her as much as possible, and when she left to wherever she left to she didn’t say bye to me or the baby (I was holding him). Fine with me. I tried talking to SO about it, waited until I wasn’t mad, explained mostly all the above instances, but he basically said “I see your side but you’re blowing it out of proportion.” So that’s that."
672,"I’m soooo relieved to be moving a whole state away from my MIL next month. I’m due for labor in February, and it’s been a hell of a ride dealing with her constantly telling me what I’m doing wrong in my pregnancy or how I need to give my baby her name (different than her sons), I’m just soooo tired of it. 

But. Of course a whole state away isn’t enough, because she told my SO that she is booking a flight and coming to stay with us the week I’m supposed to be due. Are you kidding?? 

She didn’t discuss it with me at all. I don’t want anyone to visit for AT LEAST a week after my baby is born. It caused a fight between me and my SO, who questioned if I hate his mother because I don’t want her there. I told my own mother not to come and she was absolutely understanding! 

It ended up with him telling me that I have to talk to her and get her to not come then, since I’m the one with the problem with it. She hasn’t discussed it with me, how can I tell her not to come? I’m extremely non-confrontational and everytime she has “advice” for me I smile and nod. I don’t want her to dislike me, but..

How can I go about this? There is no way I will allow her to be there. Absolutely no way


Edit: grammar/wording"
673,"My grandma (Who raised me) is a total JustNO

Let's be clear, I love this woman, shes generous, she loves me I know she does, and I do enjoy my time with her....sometimes. 

Honestly the problems started when I was a teen, at that age where I was trying to get some independance and she, being the type of person who dislikes anyone not doing exactly what she wants to do, when she wants to do it, had trouble with that. So it was a stressful time for everyone. I got married young (18) and moved away with him for four years. Our relationship during this time was pretty good, distance is a great help tbh.

Then we moved back due to finance issues after we lost our first child and started to build our lives up again while my husband went to college. Its been a rollar coaster ever since and where her JustNO traits really got heavy.

Today for example. Yesterday I made plans with my sister to go to lunch and have her over, sister is 16 and dosent really get out much during school. Grandma is always trying to get sister to go places with her, like my brothers soccer games out of town so she'll have someone to talk to but sister always says no because grandma stresses her out (Their relationship got so bad sister moved in with her other grandparents and didnt speak to grandma for a year) We just tell grandma shes busy with school but that annoys her because ""Oh its Saturday she could come if she wanted too"" but grandma also texted me this morning asking if I wanted to go to lunch with her if I wasnt tired. I said that I was already out with sister and grandma was like ""THANKS FOR INVITING MEEEE"" but I cant invite her, Ash cant be around her without stress! So I made an excuse and apologized. 

Grandma is also very passive Aggressive. I tried to call her out on it several times and she gets upset and days ""OH NO YOU ARE"" and if I try to have a honest discussion on how shes makes me feel when shes like that she gets defensive and oh no, everyone else is so mean to her and she should ""I guess I should just die"" or she'll hang up and refuse to talk. Then eventully she either pretends like nothing happens or makes you feel like its your fault. Shes very manipulative. 

Remember how I called her generous? She really is. She insists on paying for everything and I am truly guilty of letting it go to far. Before our daughter died, she paid out rent for two months because I couldnt work because I had a dying infant. She also dropped everything to stay with us and help me (throwing several tantrums at the hospital when I didnt do or say what she wanted me to say). She buys me lunch several times a week (shes always asking me to go to lunch and is sad when I say no) She even insisted on buying me a dining room table I saw in a store and liked but said I would wait and get it later.....I should have never let her do all this. It was wrong of me to keep saying yes. But she was always offering and.....I need to stop letting her spend money on me. She gave me a debit card years ago that ive used every now and again and I know the best thing to do would be to cut it up. Stop relying on her and be an adult (I'm 25)

I want to have a good, normal relationship with her. Shes getting older (76) and need assistance. Shes depressed and stressed and she has trauma from her life that effects how she behaves. I love this woman I just wish we could talk honestly and she would her me and listen when I tell her I need some space and that I dont like it when shes always getting upset I dont do what she wants me to do. She even MAKES ME SEND HER MY WORK SCHEDULE. Theres no reason for her to have it. She just wants to know when im working but why cant she be like my own MOTHER and ask me if she wants to spend time with me, like ""Hey are you free Saturday"" or ""When are you free"" 

You dont need to know my entire schedule!! 

Advice welcome guys, teach me how to deal with my JustNO who I love, but need a independence from."
674,"I didn't think I would be back so soon, but my heart is broken.

Yesterday SO and I were at SILs and BIL2s place chatting and generally hanging out, because screamin'Demon, FIL and BIL were visiting relatives in another state.

The topic of screamin' demon came up ( as always ) and SIL and BIL2 gave us these gems:

• they are only allowed to rent the apartment from screamin' demon and FIL for 6 months because MIL"" doesn't think it will work out because of the last instances ""

• SIL and BIL2 aren't doing enough work around the house ( they pay rent , cleaned the chicken and rabbit coop)

• they leave dog shit on the lawn and MIL repeatedly stepped into it ( they go around at 6 am picking their waste up and the ones that are from MILs dog but when they brought it up MIL just said ""No"")
 
And in my opinion the worst one:
• MIL has FIL believing that I stole SO from them and that I'm the evil DIL

That's the one thing I thought she would never do.
It's just so ridiculous, because he can do whatever he wants. He is at their home 2 times a week just not in their living quarters but at SILs apartment .

I just don't know what to do anymore.
Should I drop the rope? Go full NC?

I'm just confused , angry and sad that my "" friendship"" with MIL is permanently destroyed and it hurts me seeing my SO so helpless."
675,"Y’all might remember my HIPAA violating, food obsessed, kinda-Jocasta MIL and her way with words. 

She called yesterday morning to tell DH that FIL’s scheduled for surgery. It’s a pretty major procedure and will involve a long, uncomfortable recovery with a lot of time off of work because of his position. In the dairy industry example I have given in the past, while a majority of people could return to work in 2-6 weeks, FIL manhandles 15-25 pound pieces of dairy machinery for eight hours at a time, sometimes lifting them as high as shoulder height; there’s no “light duty” option, and this is the exact thing that could seriously hurt his recovery, so he will be off closer to the 6 weeks. The procedure holds an equal chance of improving his quality of life, or creating more problems for him. DH and I have been united and vocal about expressing our concerns, and encouraging him to take the time to research all available options, but FIL is an adult and can make his own choices about his health care. We both understand *why* he’s opting to get the surgery, we’re just afraid he’s wearing his rose-colored glasses. 

So Gobsmacker tells DH the date and time, and then this gem comes out of her gob: “That’s my busiest teaching day. I don’t know if he’s going to need someone else there with him or what, but I’ve got students all day.”

Y’all, I felt myself doing that fish face thing when this was relayed to me. I could understand if they booked it for Monday or something, but we’re talking about two weeks and change from now.

DH’s impulse was to make some snarky comment about “what, like you needed someone there when you had your thyroid surgery, and FIL took off work to be there for you?” but he was actually relieved to be able to say “don’t worry about it, that’s my day off; we’ll be there with him.” (Unfortunately, DH has been unwell a lot recently and he won’t be able to take time off work to take care of FIL while he recovers. We haven’t talked about it yet, but it’s possible FIL could stay here some if he needs to, but with my seizure disorder I can’t drive to him, and I can’t tolerate being there all day with the untrained barking dog and noisy music students, so...yeah... DIL-home-nursing-care remains to be seen. At least we’re gonna be there during the surgery and able to get him settled after.) I absolutely cannot understand how her first impulse wasn’t to start rescheduling her students. Narcs gonna narc I guess...

Not long after DH ended the call so he could fill me in on the latest nonsense, Gobs called back. We had a cold snap and it caused the mice she thought she had gotten rid of to flock back into her house, because the garage is packed full of decades worth of books, magazines, clothes, and other things rodents love to nest in. Gobsmacker and FIL are borderline hoarders, FIL keeps a veritable nursery/greenhouse in his bedroom, and they keep sacks of paper goods in the house. It’s like mousie heaven, and there’s enough wear-and-tear on the home that they can get in very easily. Y’all, I’ve dealt with infestations before as a teen, and we kept pet rats for many many years; I know a thing or two about rodents, it’s kinda my thing. I’ve told Gobsmacker how to get the problem under control, and I’ve told FIL too: Find where they’re getting in, block it with sturdy mesh, then eliminate them from inside. Until they do those things in that order they’re going to keep having an issue, because mice will either come in from outside or multiply. But they keep finding fixes on faceyspace and such that are easier than walking the perimeter, checking the baseboards, and being super fucking thorough. Things like filling the holes with steel wool!!! Or using peppermint oil!!!

“Okay, but that won’t work because they’re gonna push past the steel wool, chew a bigger hole, and mice will get sick when exposed to peppermint oil but y’all can’t rely on that getting them all with the numbers you’re dealing with. Block and eliminate.”

They didn’t. The mice are back. Gobsmacker was fishing for DH to come deal with it somehow. He did an excellent job of reminding her that she’s going to have to get rid of the nesting material in the garage and close off that entrance to them or they’ll start coming into the house from there, then going full grey rock. She started whinging about how she cannot cope, and she has to have FIL remove them, and after a couple of minutes of that DH promptly ended the call. I was really proud of him for that, but kinda...floored...by how hard she was angling for her sonsband to save her. Sorry, Gobsmacker, the FOG has cleared and that guy’s gone. Yay!

So tomorrow we’re gonna have our get-together with Gobs and FIL to celebrate DD2’s birthday and get our souvenirs from Gobsmacker’s trip to visit SIL. I’m really dreading it, guys, and I don’t know why (other than, you know, Gobsmacker and FIL lol). I am sorely tempted to put together some BINGO cards. Arts and crafts make everything better, right?!"
676,"I’m not sure where to post this. 
I have a vile just no mother. She is so mean to my son, I have three kids but only she bullies him. The youngest. Yesterday was because he cried, she took away his toys and his candy. He told me, he doesn’t want to go to grandmas house Cos she fights and yells at him. 

When she dropped my crying boy off she was going off about how bad he was. I replied he’s 4! 
I’m so sad and mad for him, that’s not fair. So because I ignored her and I never scolded my baby boy. She kicked me off her phones family plan, which is great in my eyes Cos it’s less awkward to walk away from her again. 

Not to forget it’s also Midterms this week, my first ever and instead of support. I’m getting attacked like I’m the asshole and I just stood up for my son. 

I want to cry."
677,"POSSIBLE TRIGGER ANXIETY AND ADDICTION READ ON CAREFULLY. So my MIL and I get along decently well most of the time (seeing as how I take care of everything she needs, even more so than husband sometimes). We also live together! I will lead by saying I have extremely unpredictable anxiety attacks and just generalized anxiety. If anyone has dealt with it they know it can present itself in anger and irritability at times, leading husband and I to occasional tiffs. Well, he deems it okay to relay some of these things to her when she asks what’s wrong (couldn’t fckn tell ya why) so this almost always leads to her coming into my room while I’m sobbing and hyperventilating and 1st- accusing me of doing some sort of drug 2nd- forcing me deeper into the abyss just by asking me 10.000 questions I don’t know the answer to because I literally cannot think. So at some point I just ask her to leave. I try and find the breath to tell her I’ll be fine. She, of course, NEVER takes this at face value. So I have to get a little.. more blunt. Not proud of it but I have before just blatantly said it is none of her business. She obvi hated this. I do respect that it is her house, but I feel I deserve privacy to a certain extent. (I left out the fact that we live here as per her request and I have tried to move us out but it always somehow turns around on me) like this for example “well, if you feel you need to get your own place I’ll understand, but I will be lonely without you guys” so out of guilt and kindness, we’ve decided to stay multiple times. That sure as fuck has never stopped her from reminding me that this is her house and apparently literally everything that happens in her house is her business to the point of inserting herself in whatever rough patch we may be going through. That isn’t the worst of it though. She has said on numerous occasions that I “make myself have panic attacks” to apparently “manipulate situations to my advantage” I’ve also been told that my panic attacks are a “inconvenience and that they are not welcome or wanted in her house”. I have tried on numerous occasions to explain to her that i HAVE in fact been diagnosed. I have been sent to the ER for severe attacks. I used to take anti anxiety meds, Valium/Xanax (not at same time) but that they are too much for me, they make me feel drowsy and almost high. So yeah, if I took meds like I should be I could technically avoid having them, but at the cost of basically being a zombie addict. I have also tried explaining that once you start taking benzos like those, after only two weeks you become physically dependent, which can lead to the worst withdrawals of any medication-one that can and has taken many lives. Oh yeah, and I’ve been told by her that husband and I just “shouldn’t fight” her logic was that her and husbands stepdad never fight, except when I reminded her about the times I came home to literal screaming that could be heard outside, that was forgotten. It then became “I can do whatever I want in my house”. But I don’t remember telling her she couldn’t, just that she did and was wrong in her claim. Well, there is more but I’ll stop here with the essay I’ve already written. Hope this is relevant to the group as I feel it is."
678,"Things were great until we got engaged two years ago - married one year in September. .. she said she wanted to be involved in the wedding planning (she lives down south, we live in the northeast), so I tried to included her, but she never answered my texts or emails...nor did she give us a wedding gift or
Card?!?!

UPDATE: DH spoke with MIL- she claims she never said that.  I don’t believe her! 


This past weekend, was the first time
I saw her since our wedding...she was very cold to me and my husband....she asks my step daughter - Her granddaughter, if she ever gets time alone with her Dad now that his little buddy (me) follows him around everywhere!!

My SD is 18 and a freshman in college...I have a great relationship with her and her brother... she was my maid of honor! 

MIL didn’t care for husbands ex wife either... always thought it was because his ex is not a warm, social person... now I’m thinking she’s just jealous... she also comments on how we spend our money and expects us to visit her on our vacations...not fair! It was her choice to move far away- I do not wish to spend my vacations under her thumb, on her schedule, etc"
679,"First off, thank you so much for the advice, it’s definitely helped. So last update I said that FDH’s siblings were done with FMiL and her money demands, they are, but I should clarify, most of them send her money monthly and have for several years, this was why when she was suddenly stressed out about needing extra cash for her elective eye surgery they didn’t even bother to reply. They don’t really engage with her because they don’t want to talk about her latest drama, they just want to throw money at her and be done. That’s what they meant by, good luck, she’s your problem now, because FDH is engaging with her. 
He’s been VLC for several years and this recent contact is all wedding related i.e. she knows that he wants her to be at our wedding and is using that to facilitate more contact/craziness. So we paid for her plane ticket to our destination wedding location, a few days ago she texts FDH to tell him she and the boyfriend want to fly together so they’ve bought their own tickets. In other words, her newest plan is to cash in the plane ticket he bought her, pocket that money, and then fly out on their own when she was crying into the phone so upset because she couldn’t afford to fly out for the wedding. 
It’s completely insane, and luckily FDH was right away on the phone to the airline requesting a refund/changing the flight information around so we could use it instead to fly to my family for Christmas. 
I just don’t get her thought process, she bullies him into buying this, then complains because she wants a free vacation, then doesn’t even use the plane ticket???"
680,"So this happened in public a week ago now and I still can’t get over her comment.

Just a little backstory, me and my SO are blessed to have our little boy who is nearly two and for the past year we have been trying to give him a sibling. This past Friday I experienced my fourth early miscarriage this year and I am heartbroken. Now when we told JNMIL her comment was ‘ I told you so’. Like what???? How can a woman who had suffered losses herself say such a hurtful comment??

It gets worse. This past week all she’s been going on about is this couples gender reveal. (They have no relation to her at all they just rent a bungalow from her). Now let’s put this into perspective she NEVER sees our son and has never offered to look after him for us. My family have him over all the time no questions asked. So she’s going on and on saying this is so exciting and she can’t wait to look after this baby and find out the gender.

The gender reveal was today. And this woman goes and tags me in the photos taken, just me not my partner which is her son. Just me. After I’ve told her how hurt I am about her comment and she goes and does this. I am so done with this it’s unreal. She knows I’m hurting and still does this."
681,"It started innocently enough I guess. 4 days ago My sister texted me saying she and her husband aren't exchanging gifts - I said that was fine as we likely weren't going to attend Christmas anyway, but please call and stop by for a visit. I then get a 2 paragraph long text about how I ""shouldn't use the babies as bargaining chips"" and ""let mom and dad be the good grandparents the babies deserve, the babies deserve the best"" along with a lot of ""I know you don't want to hear this, but they love them so much."" also a bit of pity ""I know mom and dad haven't been sleeping"".

I'm honestly getting pretty sick of all the fucking rugsweeping enablers at this point so I didn't hold back. I made it clear and said my mother is mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I said yes, my daughters deserve the best, and they don't deserve to see their mother undermined and treated like a lesser class citizen. I said that if they really do love them, they'll look in themselves and discover the root of the problem, and try to fix it rather than bullying me until they get their way. Also, I don't care if they're not sleeping. Not my problem.

2 days ago my mom just SHOWS UP at my house demanding to see my kids. My husband was out front shoveling, and handled it. He said you can't come in, they're sleeping, and we have a guest over anyway (which was true). Mom makes a sassy comment about how guest is alone (I'm inside, wtf?) demands to see HER grandkids. Complains about how I said she ""treats me differently than her other kids, I bought her a house! I paid her loans!"" I never claimed she treats me differently, but I know I've never seen her berate the other 3 in front of a crowd of relatives or complain to me about how awful her other children are like she has my siblings. The house thing was stupid - I was going to buy a trailer, they insisted it was unsafe and bought a house for me to live in, and I ended up with 2x the bills and no equity. Thanks mom! Edit: I do not live in this house. As expected, it wasn't going well and I only lived there a year. I've owned a home with DH 3.5 years now.

She said some other garbage things about me, claimed she couldn't contact us, so my husband made her call him to prove her number wasn't blocked. She said she tried to get ahold of me bc her mom has cancer. I called grandma. Grandma had a lump removed in January and no new developments, just a minor med change. Mom wasn't even the one to tell me about the cancer scare in January anyway, so fuck off mom. She drove away crying.

That night, my aunt called to talk about my mom and get my side of the story. She admitted that my mom has had issues with all her relationships her entire life - siblings and her parents. She kept asking ""how we can fix this"". Well Aunt, you're the psychologist and you should know better than me ""we"" can't fix this. She asked if my mom could visit- it was a flat NO from me, I don't want her here. She brought up therapy, I made it clear I am not doing therapy and have no interest in ""fixing"" my mom. I have 2 kids, an at home business, one on the way, and a husband on the road. I don't have time to fix the issues the rest of the family hasn't been able to for the 6 decades my mother has been alive, and frankly, I don't care. Aunt asks ""how long do you plan to do this?"" All I said was, ""I don't know, but the last 2 weeks not worrying about having to see or pacify my mother has been nothing but peaceful"". Again, with the mentioning she's not sleeping. Again, with the ""what can we/you do to fix this"". I asked, ""Why does everyone keep asking \*me\* to fix this? Has anyone talked to Nmom and told her to not be a dick?"" Aunt then admitted that talking to Nmom is impossible, because she sees it as an attack. Many people have tried and she lashes out back at anyone who helps- Gma tried for years, so did siblings. So they pacified her. I said I don't think anyone in the family can ""fix"" this, then.

DH has caused some issues we have since smoothed out - he wants to let her in. I made it clear that no, she's been nasty, she keeps behaving this way, don't confuse my family. Support my decision, we are officially NO CONTACT with my mom. If you act like this, DH, they're going to think you're the weak link in our united front and not take us seriously. He doesn't like it but he hasn't dealt with an abusive mother for 28 years.

Tonight, grandma called. Apparently, Nmom called her asking to have brunch tomorrow. ""She never does this! If it goes well, can we come visit after?""

No, no you can't. Grandma, you are welcome but do NOT bring my mother to my house.

""Maybe she's changed!""

She hasn't changed her behavior in the YEARS I've told her to stop being a cunt. She hasn't changed in the 2 days she was spouting bullshit about me on my doorstep. More ""can we fix this"" blah blah blah. NO \*WE\* CANNOT FIX THIS AND I DO NOT CARE. A comment about spilling ""fairy dust"" over the ""two of you"" to make everything better. I made it clear that \*I\* am not the problem- she is fixating on me because of my kids, and because I am standing up to her. She has issues with everyone, you gma, her siblings, everyone. ""I know, I failed with your Nmom. I'm sorry"". No gma, you didn't fail. I don't know what happened or why she is the way she is, I know you tried, don't blame yourself. I was quite mean until this point but I feel bad, because grandma really has tried, taking mom to therapy and trying over and over to connect. She's not perfect, she makes sassy rude comments, but no one is, right? I made it clear again, I love you grandma, call me if you want to come by but do NOT bring my mother, and good luck.

I'm pretty done with all these FM trying to rugsweep on my mother's behalf. I'm going to have to shut down conversations before they start and I'm not looking forward to it. I feel like I've said my ""side"" to enough people that I shouldn't be seen as the asshole at this point, but I don't really care. The entire family can cut me out and I will sleep soundly knowing I won't have to play my mom's stupid games any more or deal with her.

Edit: removed a name, clarified housing"
682,"As some of you know from my past posts, mil who barely knows me told my DH to leave me and she will help raise baby when he told her I was pregnant. This is his first baby, mil first grand, and we are both in our mid 30s. Well weeks, then months go by.... no word from justnomil, until Justyessil has her wedding last month. Justnomil told us we NEED to go out to dinner together and buy baby stuff. Month goes by and still no text from justnomil to DH or me (always a blissful moment but never lasts) His sister has informed him through text that Justnomil has bought baby stuff, how justnomil is so excited, and how we all should get together soon. Does this women who hasn't asked but once how the pregnancy is going the Entire Pregnancy honestly think we want any of this stuff?!?! Shes never even seen my other children, never been to my house, but thinks shes going to play grandma when the baby comes without any apologies or change on her part? 

   Here's my question on needing advice, his sister (my sil) is very sweet but a huge enabler to justnomil, her mother. How do I handle her? I know she means well...
What do I do about the baby stuff if its dropped off at our house or if justnomil's other family members give us grief about it? 

I'm so close to delivery and I just wanna chill out till then and not deal with bs drama. I know this all is about to blow up in DH and mys face. Justnomil always makes everything about her some how. Is witness program too extreme? 🙉🙊🙈"
683,"So we had the cookout. It was a disaster as was expected. It's been several weeks so I'm just going to go over highlights.
  
During the cookout:

* We arrive at 4 when we are told. The baby missed a nap. No food and no entertainment appeared until 6 pm.
* I tried several times to get the baby to nap on me and every fricking time Cake Police got in my face asking if she could take baby outside. 
* After telling her no because we didn't bring sunscreen, Cake Police offers her own tanning lotion.
* CBF when I told her that her tanning lotion isn't good enough for babies.
* During the FIVE MINUTES I had to pee I let Cake Police hold her. When I came back a god damn stranger was holding her.
* Stranger didn't want to give her back until I got pissy and asked her if she planned on nursing my child because it was dinner time.
* DH and I brought our own dinner because of previous experience. While we are eating in the dining room we hear Cake Police and her family devolve into a homophobic, racist, and sexist rant. Lots of praising Trump and declaring that they don't respect gender identity because God told them it was wrong.
* Another baby around DD2's age almost getting into a can of RAID while their parents just watched. DH is the one who stopped them.
* A plethora of comments about how we are helicopter parents and how I'm the crazy vaccine lady (because I'm outspoken about pro vaccines)
  
I left before everyone else and got the hell out of there. I dealt with all of the above as it happened,   so no advice needed.
  
Things have been crazy the last 2 weeks. My mom was diagnosed with cancer, and Cake Police's mom has been moved to palliative care. Her health went downhill very quickly. 
  
Cake Police has been uncharacteristically nice during this time, she texted me to ask how I was handling mom's diagnosis and see if I needed anything. Maybe because she relates since her mom will probably pass soon. I don't know, but I don't think it's going to last. 
  
To the meat and potatoes of the story. I'm pretty sure in past posts I've discussed how Cake Police gets into trends or fads frequently. She will completely devote herself to the new thing...for like 2 weeks. Then she moves on or loses interest.  DH told me last night that her new obsession is, *drumroll* ... Doomsday Prepping.
  
Cake Police is very firmly MAGA even with all the current events. She has bought into the hysteria and paranoia of immigrants coming to invade the border (we don't live anywhere near either border), and the whole idea of a Civil War against *""Them Libs witch hunting the president!""* 
  
Yes, you read that right. She's prepping for a Civil War. 
  
She told DH that her and FIL are learning how to can their own food and will be growing a garden in their backyard. They also want to outfit their house with solar panels and fortify it against intruders. Except...she rents her damn house. That haven't cleared any of the modifications they want to do with the landlord. 
  
Also growing a garden takes a lot of hard work, patience, and dedication. We live in an area where the weather is very inconsistent. It isn't impossible to have a personal garden, but it's difficult if you don't put the time and effort into it. She's out of town several days every week for her business. FIL is too disabled to tend garden. When I told DH all of this, he tried to tell me that he thought his mom was a great planner and hard worker. I laughed in his face and reminded him about the cookout.
  
So how did this conversation come about? Well, DH went to her house to study for school and found a shotgun just chilling on her living room table.
  
She's stockpiling guns! You know, in case Civil War erupts and she needs to defend her home. Apparently she bought many more guns. She does not own a gun cabinet or ammo lockbox. She's just storing them in the garage and her closet. 
  
When DH asked her about gun safety she had put zero thought into what to do to childproof her home so our girls didn't get ahold of the guns. She's extremely pro gun and probably thinks we are going to let her show DD1 how to hold a gun.
  
That won't be happening. DH agrees that we won't be bringing the girls over until she has the guns and ammo securely locked up in separate locations. No compromises on this one."
684,"In the past I’ve been labeling my JNmom’s behavior as microagressions mixed with I don’t know what.  But maybe I’ve been wrong.  The thing is as far as mom’s go she’s never neglected us or taken drugs/alcohol, my parents are still together.  She’s always been a yeller, a fighter, and a crier.  I work with kids in bad family situations and I would call myself lucky.  It’s hard for me to see things clearly.  Here’s what happened at breakfast and a perfect example of her “innocent” behavior.

This morning my dad was cooking me breakfast and also cleaning up the kitchen at the same time.  My mom comes in and starts saying “while you’re cleaning make sure you wipe down XYZ.”  My dad stops and looks at her like “are you kidding me” because he’s a grown man and great at cleaning and would obviously do what she’s saying.  He says “yes I know I was going to get to that.”

He goes about finishing cooking my breakfast, I’m eating it my mom is sitting next to me.  Then he wipes the one spot in particular he pointed out.  She says “thank you” but in this sickly sweet tone of voice.  My dad immediately says exasperated  “don’t thank me!  I was going to do it anyway!”  I jump on it as well and say “why do you always do that!?”

Of course she immediately gets defensive because we didn’t say things calmly.  She says “I was trying to do a nice thing and thank your father.  I was genuinely being nice and you make me the bad guy.  Mom is always the bad person.”  And she stomps away and starts to cry.

Now she’s stomping around the kitchen and living room because she wants us to apologize.  I said I’m sorry for being louder slightly, but I’m not apologizing for questioning why she always does this because she does.  She says again “I did nothing wrong!”  I said she feels that way because she doesn’t understand her role in what just happened and I can explain it to her when she’s calm or if/when she was to grow as a person.  I tell her this will happen in the future unless she owns up to her part in it and tries to understand instead of being defensive.  

She’s just pouting on the couch now. Hasn’t said one word in like 30 minutes.

What would you call this?  It’s always the little things that add up over time with her and I am so sick of it.  I know I can’t change her behavior (thanks to 2 failed therapy sessions where I was told by the therapist “I’m fine” and my mom sounds juvenile and she can’t help my mom).  But I feel so bad for my dad and would love to give him some tools for how to react or teach my mom without her knowing.  IDK.  Halp!!!"
685,"So from my previous post, I posted how I don’t know if I have to go along with the mama nickname my MIL has. 

Now the problem is, shes calling herself nana? But every time my child calls for me and shouts mama she keeps answering before me and going “YES” like she does it so quickly it’s really embarrassing, we only see her once a week but last week I just said to her 

“Why you answering when you know that’s what Dc calls me, you really are trying to confuse her and it’s not fair, I know what you’re doing, pretending to be okay with Nana but not so slyly trying to let dc know you are also mama”. She just shook her head and said “I’m used to the other gc calling out mama first for me”

I said “well that’s because you trained them but I haven’t allowed it hence why DC does not call you mama, she calls me”

She just walked off but my husband thinks it will sort itself out and we shouldn’t go LC just because of his mum being difficult..
I said well I don’t feel comfortable visiting your mum when I know it’s just a battle field inside and she spends the duration trying to confuse our child. He’s like “just continue standing up for yourself”

I need some good shut down material . (I don’t care if it involves them going in a mood with me, it’s for the best for me)"
686,"Occasional Banshee has had some weird symptoms somewhat recently.  A few weeks ago, I pushed her to to see her doctor.  He sent her to a specialist, to be safe, last week.   The specialist ordered a bunch of tests.  I told OB to let me know when she got results.

Today, I noticed an unexpected package was delivered.   When I opened it, it was a rather sweet gift, signed ""from grandma.""  I am currently expecting.

I gave OB a call to thank her, since she's mostly been behaving herself.  On the phone, she says, ""Well, are you going to bother asking me about my results?""

How was I supposed to know she got results back?!  I don't know whether they're instantaneous or take 3 weeks!  And I told HER to tell ME when she got them!

So, it turns out, she's dying.  Life expectancy is 5 years.  She's not even 60 yet.

I'm home alone, pregnant, trying to deal with this info.  I'm not handling it well.

After a while, my husband comes home.  He sees me sobbing on the couch and asks whats wrong.  I tell him.

&gt;DH: I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;TDL:  Wait.  How do you know?  
&gt;  
&gt;DH:  I saw it on facebook yesterday.  I assumed she told you and you weren't ready to talk about it yet.

What.  The.  Fuck!

So I go online.  Sure as shit, she posted about it YESTERDAY.  OB told THE INTERNET that she was dying before me, her daughter, who was patiently waiting to hear the news!

And not only that, when I read the comments, I learned she had known for DAYS.

So, now I'm a hot mess!  I'm livid because she never even fucking bothered to call to tell me she was dying.  She waited until I called her about something to share the news.  Then she guilted me for not asking first.  So, I feel like an asshole for not asking.  And I feel like an asshole for being angry with a dying woman.  And I'm angry that I can't calm down and I'm stressing my baby, which isn't good for her.  And I'm sad.  So very very sad.

Fuck!  Like, Just, Fuck!  I don't even know what to do with myself.

Facebook!?  Really?!

EDIT:  Yes, she is actually ill as she says she is.  No, she doesn't pull this type of shit - it's not her MO."
687,"TW: STILLBIRTH/MISCARRIAGE

&amp;#x200B;

Been a lurker for awhile now, but never felt the need to post as my MIL (FIL/Immediate family of ILs) were more just the BEC type for me, but serious JNs with D(ear)H. Things got bad enough tonight that I felt I needed to post. To vent, to ask for help, to make sure we aren't the ones overreacting here. Sorry for the length.

The title says the bulk of it. My mildly JNMIL went from BEC to HOLY SH\*Z JNMIL in one phone conversation. I'm still shaken, upset, trying not to cry and still feeling like I want to puke over the whole situation. So probably some background before getting to tonight's phone call- and this may get confusing so I'm super sorry in advance if it does.

DH and I are expecting our ""first"" child in December (he's adopting my 9 DD. I have a 16 DS and he has an 11 DS from previous relationships). He lost a son almost 8 years ago due to a stillbirth and so this child has been bittersweet for him. He just told his family about 2 weeks ago that we are expecting. We mailed out baby shower invitations so I told him he kind of needed to tell his family before they got them in the mail. He told his Aunts that he has a great relationship with first. Then he told his mother. He has not and does not plan on speaking to his brother or sister (or their SOs) about our lives. Many of his family that we had invited live out of state and therefore are unable to make it. We did not send invitations to his siblings, as they are super JNs and we don't want the drama of them there. I have been getting texts all day from family we expected that were going to be unable to make it. No big deal there. Tonight JNMIL called. I don't really deal with his family to begin with as they are his family and I would make things much worse than they already are (I can be super petty when wronged, or when someone I love has been wronged- and he tries to play peacemaker for the time being since we live in their second house). So when MIL called to RSVP to the shower I let it go to voicemail. When we had gotten home she had left a message on our landline as well. DH didn't want to call her back so we ignored the message for several hours. She called again. This time he answered. She stated that she was calling to inform us that her, FIL and SIL would be at the shower. DH reiterated that SIL had not been invited so why was she coming. MILs reply was ""as an ambassador for family that can't make it"" uh, what? First off why does there need to be an ambassador for out-of-state family when MIL and FIL will be there? The second justification was that apparently I had posted to the book of faces that anyone was welcome to come, just show up. (That's totally NOT what was posted, but there was so much wrong there to begin with- I didn't post that, don't have his siblings or parents on my lists, nor most of his family at all. I have ONE of his aunts on my page and she admittedly doesn't use it often because she doesn't know how to navigate it very well so she just doesn't. What ACTUALLY was posted was done as an announcement post consisting of an ultrasound image and a caption saying that we were planning a special party for a special someone and if people wanted an official invitation to let me know and I would send them one. So NO WHERE did it say ""if you want to come, just show up"" and if it did why would I bother to put an ""RSVP By Date"" on the invites???) I agreed with DH that she was incorrect in what she assumed. Her response was then to demand a list of who was acceptable to go to the shower, who was not, and our reasoning why. Again, uh, what? Okay crazy lady. You aren't paying for any of this. Why do you think you get a say in our decisions for whom we have or have not invited and our reasoning why? She then proceeded to inform DH that we needed to act like adults and learn to get along with everyone. The conversation was then mostly ended and they hung up. Not even 15 minutes later the phone was ringing again. MIL, again. Demanding info about the house we are in the process of buying (another story to itself) because they ""needed a date"" of when we will be moving. I told DH that it was more likely that a) FIL was informed of the phone conversation and made a comment about wanting us the eff out of his house, b) SIL was informed of conversation, similar response; or c) MIL wanted a powerplay of ""we gave you $20k you better be grateful to us and do as we demand."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I am asking for advice from all you gurus of MIL drama. We have a family gathering we are expected to be at next weekend. They do these several times a year as a joint holiday party/birthday parties. They usually involve the out of state Aunt, the local Aunt/Husband, Uncle/Wife, as well as DH's immediate family. This party is for SS, DD, Aunt and her husband, as well as myself. We are quite certain that BIL will make an asshole comment about the whole situation. I'm just terrified of having any spotlight on me where that pack of hyenas is concerned. I'm also terrified that it's going to be turned into some mock baby shower since most of the family is unable to make it/not invited. We feel as though we \*have\* to go since we didn't make it to the summer gathering as we had plans made a month in advance and were informed of said gathering a week and a half before the event. So reddit, how do we handle the gathering? I don't want to go but I don't want to send DH to his doom without me by his side. I really super don't want any of the kids there either. I feel like I have no say with any of this at this point. We are still trying to figure out how to tactfully tell MIL that we don't need to justify our decisions on whom we invited and why. And that if they received an invitation from us directly, they are in fact invited. No physical invitation, not invited. I know that ""no"" is a complete sentence. I know how to go NC but that gets tricky as the whole situation is a tangled mess we are trying to untangle and get out of. We have many many people that do love us that are already willing to stand between DH and the ILs from hell to keep them out of the shower if necessary. But how do we keep it from escalating to that point? Or is there no hope of that? Do we need to have a fallout plan in place as there will be no peaceful resolution to this? help.... please? my sanity depends upon some outside perspective."
688,"Hi, new poster here, and I am not sure if I am over reacting.  SO and I are not married, but have been living together for 3, and dating for 6. I'm from the East Coast, and he is from the West Coat, but we live in a different state. We each spend our Thanksgivings with our own families, but for the last three years i've spend Christmas with SO and his family.

Well JNMIL has recently retired, and is bored (and very well off). Well she decided to spend Christmas this year on the East Coast, and just bought a ticket for SO. Well i have been traveling a lot this year, and i don't think i have it in me to do a 6 hour flight to the East Coast (especially since i will be there for Thanksgiving). It also didn't seem fair for me and SO to go to the east coast with his family, since, well my family lives there.  (Christmas location for them and my family are the same plane distance). Am i overreacting to be pissed at the fact that she didn't take me into consideration? I called out my SO for leaving me alone for Christmas  and he said that it was his expectation to spend Christmas with them... 

I'm not mad at her husband because he just lets her do whatever she likes"
689,"TW: Depression, Self Harm, Suicidal Thoughts.

This is my first time posting. So quick background on me and SO. I am a 21 and he is 23, not married but have been together for 3 years. My personal life has been incredibly depressing due to a plethora of health reasons and my own family issues. 

My SO has 2 sisters, twins, my age. They left for school when we first started dating so I’m not very close to either and his relationship with them is quite weak. For the last 3 years I have witnessed the absolute fuckery that is those siblings. SO is the the eldest and only boy so he faces different expectations. His piece of fucking shit sisters get away with sooo much it’s ridiculous. My SO isn’t perfect, but he’s a good guy and tries his best. His mother always comes up with the most arbitrary excuses. “Oh they’re just going through a lot,” “they’re young”. Hypocritical excuses that apply to them but not SO. I began to understand him better as the effects of the blatant favoritism took its toll. He bottled it all up and I could see the destructive downfall he was heading towards. I have a messy relationship with my own mom and I know that pain, I never want him to go through that. I helped him work through his anger and through the pain, to the point the rest of his family took notice. “Thank you” “We’re so glad he’s with you” “You’re like family” 

You’re like family...... I can’t think of those words without crying. That bitch (MIL) is fucking crazy and unreasonable and fucking lying and forgetting when it’s convenient sack of shit. God this fucking hurts. When I first started dating SO, MIL was married. It was a clearly toxic relationship that was headed towards divorce. Earlier this year it finally happened, the ex wife moved out. MIL was a wreck. I felt bad, I don’t like seeing people in pain. One of SO’s sisters was going to school out of state, the other one lived with their dad about 40 minutes away. SO was working long night shifts so he wasn’t able to see his mom much. She stopped eating, had constant anxiety attacks, it was awful. I stayed over during the trail separation, 1 month, to help take care of her. Things weren’t perfect but I was happy being there for their family in a time of need. During this time the phrase “You’re like family” and “You’re a part of this family” were used heavily. I’ve been around for 3 years, longer than any girlfriend any of the siblings have had.

Then I got a phone call from my mom one morning “Your dog is missing” FUCK THIS HURTS. Snuggles, was my baby, I delivered her and she’s been by my side since she was born. I can’t express how much this dog means to me. I was heartbroken. I go to therapy and requested extra sessions in the following weeks. TLDR: I became depressed and wanted to end my pain.

My SO is incredible and helped me get out of the dark place. My therapist asked me if I was upset with my MIL, had it not been for her divorce I would still have my dog. I said no, it wasn’t her fault, I made the choice to trust my family to take care of her while I was away. (Note: My family has taken care of her before and I have 1 simple rule for my dog. They were aware of the situation.) I held no resentment towards her. 

TODAY. MIL decided to have the family get together to go to a pumpkin patch. She explicitly told my SO I was not invited and made a big deal of it. “No girlfriends” Then he finds out that his sister is bringing her girlfriend. He was pissed and decided not to go. This isn’t something new. This has happened NUMEROUS times and at first he would go to things but now when I’m disrespected or belittled he chooses to exclude himself. This time I was roped into this shitshow by his sister, the one who went alone, and his dad. After talking to them I realized I had to play the long game, a long manipulative one. I decided to go alone for his dad, who understood why his son wasn’t going and didn’t have any ill feelings. MIL would shit talk my SO and his sisters would piggyback off of it and I tried to diffuse it as much as possible. On the car ride back I spoke with MIL and tried to talk to her about how she hurt her son’s feelings. (On top of talking shit to the group she texted him horrible things and told him off IRL) She said she wanted him there but treated him like shit for choosing not to come. She got upset with me and said horrible things about him. Then she said to me “You’re not family, you’re just a girlfriend” 

3 years of me being there for her while her own daughters couldn’t for whatever reasons. 3 years of helping her son get through trauma. 3 years of going to family events. 3 fucking years. I lost my dog because I chose to be there for this woman!!!! I lost the only thing that loved me unconditionally, I spiraled into an intense suicidal depression. For the first time in my life I didn’t want to die, I worked so hard to get to where I was, but I really saw no reason to live, the pain was so intense I wanted to die and that terrified me. (SO is fucking wonderful, he was there for me and helped me get out of my hole. If it wasn’t for him I’d be 6 ft under)

I don’t know if I can forgive her. I don’t know if I can continue to watch her treat my SO like shit. I can’t imagine being a part of that family. I don’t know what fo do. After my dog went missing I had to face some harsh realities. I decided it was best for my own mental and physical health to cut myself off from my family. It was painful, I’m 21 and therapy helped me finally admit to myself that my family doesn’t love me the way I need them to. I’ve come to terms with this. SO let his parents know my situation and they reassured me I was a part of THEIR family. I really don’t know what to do. Please help me. I don’t have a mom I can go to, or a grandma, no aunts."
690,"** update**
Mil has just updated her profile picture of a photo of her and DD. I personally messaged her politely asking why she didn't ask me and if she could change the privacy settings to friends only. She hasn't replied. 

Hey! New to reading mil posts and first time poster, first time mum. Need to vent! Long post. 

So, I had my DD 10 months ago. Been with DH for a few years. Never had an issue with MIL or SIL until after I gave birth. To give some context, the issue has been that I'm just the middle-man for ""their"" baby. Mil pops over whenever she wants and then decides to stay never giving myself or partner space. From the beginning she has told me how horrible my parenting methods are for not breastfeeding or following through with cloth nappies, how I keep the house because the woman should clean while the man is at work etc. She believes her DS/ my DH is perfect and has no fault of parenting, even though I do everything. He just sits outside and smokes and drinks all the time then goes to work during the day. The apple didn't fall far from the tree because his mother is exactly the same. Any-who, ever since having DD she has completely flipped a switch with how she sees and treats me. Now she is always rude, sarcastic or passive aggressive. For instance, I had the spare room set up for her one time with fresh sheets and she didn't like the sheets I chose for her so she ripped them off the bed and used them for her dog she brought up and rearranged the whole room to her liking. I rearranged it back when she left! She also took our spare key to the house and got keys cut for herself too and deliberately pops over on purpose when she knows DDs nap time, goes in our room and wakes her up then judges us for how our room is kept. I have tried multiple times to try and give her some of her own medicine and DH doesn't see an issue with her whatsoever because he thinks she's just the queen of his life and that a grandmother should have a big part in DD life. Anytime MIL or SIL see DD they always comment on how she only looks like DH and not me and say ""wow isn't she just DH, I don't see you at all."" They get a complete kick out of it because they know it upsets me. 

Okay so to the story now. Long rant I know. MIL has cut back her time coming over only just recently and never messages me or DH. She messages SIL to communicate with me or for SIL to come over and snoop the house and take videos of DD and send them to her. When SIL comes over she always says, ""time to get photos for your favourite grandma!"" and won't show me the photos she's taken. I have told her at least 3 times I don't feel comfortable with her taking photos of DD and/or posting them on social media in which she's ignored. Again DH isn't controlling the situation  whatsoever thinking it is fine. MIL also texts SIL to communicate to me about DD too saying how is DD and never about how DH and I are. SIL asked me to pop over the other day to collect a gift from MIL which were new bathers for DD. I asked her why she didn't just give them to me and she said oh mum never has time with work to pop over much anymore and I said how come she can come and see you then? She said oh it's on her way home from work and I said so is our place, she never has an issue coming over when it suits her. It always about how they can see and get photos and time with DD without coming through to me about it. 

To finalise my rant, I'm just at my wits end with this situation. I want to take down MIL and SIL with their control over my daughter. I just don't know what comebacks to say and how to show DH that they're both too much. I wish we could move somewhere difficult for her to access us. I don't know how to approach DH and let him know I have an issue with MIL/SIL situation. 

Thanks everyone. Just one tired mum!"
691,"Hello again!

I posted about a week ago venting because my J?mom likes to ask who my favourite person is as a way of pressuring me to pick her over my SO, and generally complains about the fact that he ""stole me away"" (I moved across the country for work over a year ago and he moved to be with me, so no). She has also been bothering me about letting her sleep in the main bedroom with me and kicking SO out into the sofa, which I've shot down repeatedly. 

Well, after she asked again a week ago and I refused to answer her question, she hung up on me pretty quick. I left it for a day or two and then sent her a long, carefully worded text outlining why it was not a reasonable question, and how going forward I want our relationship to be one between two adults where we are both treated equally, seeing as I'm 25 and fully independent. I also explained that I love her and want to keep talking regularly but that I need boundaries as well- namely no undermining/comparing herself to SO and accepting that I have a busy life and can't talk all the time.

WELL. That was on Sunday night, and I have had zero response since then. Radio silence. This is coming from a woman that complained about how ""we never talk anymore"" when I was calling her twice a week.

Not sure what response I was expecting, but I'm sticking to my guns. It's Canadian Thanksgiving and I'm making a damn impressive dinner by myself this weekend, so I have other things to worry about while she stews over my very simple boundaries a little longer. Happy Turkey Day to all of you lovely redditors as well, and thanks for the great advice on my last post!

TL;DR Wrote a polite but firm message to my mom setting boundaries re: her pressuring me to choose favourites between herself and my SO of almost 7 years, and generally being pushy. No response in almost a week, going to hold out and enjoy Thanksgiving instead of dealing with it because turkey 🦃"
692,"So, I'll go ahead and apologize in advance because I just know this is going to get way super long. I suggest grabbing a drink and settling in for a while. This is a throwaway account because I'm going to share some pretty dark family stuff that I don't really want following my regular account around. 

My family, myself (36f), husband (35m) and two young daughters, went camping with my parents a couple weeks ago for a weekend. We went to the same campground that my parents always took my sister and I when we were younger. 

Because we were back visiting a familiar place years later, my parents were doing a lot of reminiscing and sharing stories from camping trips past when my sister and I were kids and teens. After a while, I started to think that maybe I was going a little crazy and wondered if I was just completely misremembering my childhood. Most stories that my parents shared just involved my sister, her friends and my parents' friends, kind of like I had never even been there. When they did talk about an event that I was involved in, they kind of wrote me out of the story, instead replacing me with someone else. It was starting to really get to me. We had decided to drive into town to visit a favorite ice cream place that we had always went to in the summer and my dad actually asked me if I had ever been before. Like I hadn't ONLY went with them multiple times a summer every single year during my childhood.

Later Saturday evening, my dad left to drive about an hour home to watch a football game on TV with my sister and he wasn't planning on coming back that night. This left me, my husband, my mom, and my daughters at the campground for the evening. 

Things seemed okay at first after my dad left, but then it didn't take my mom long to be in an obvious bad mood. My mom way overplans and prepares for everything so she brought massive totes of food for this two-day trip. She had made many comments about needing to arrange her totes because she had a lot of bread in there that was getting smashed, and then when it looked like it might rain, she stacked her totes and moved them up against the picnic table under the EZup because she had bread in there and didn't want the rain to get into the totes. When it didn't seem like it was going to rain anymore, DH asked her if he could make more room by the picnic table by moving the totes and tried to joke with her, saying ""I heard there's bread in there."" I put that as a direct quote because that is literally all that he said. She abruptly stood up and said she needed to go for a walk. When we said, okay, have a good walk, she pretty much ignored us which I knew was a sign that for whatever reason she was pissed at us.

When she walked away, I mentioned to DH that she seemed angry. He basically said, I wouldn't worry about it because my mom had told him earlier that it was going to be a super hot day and she doesn't do well in the heat and that if she was grumpy that was why, and to ignore her. So I let it go and tried to just be upbeat and as non-abrasive as possible when she returned.

She gets back and I'm on edge trying to not say something that might set her off and put her in an even worse mood. My husband and I start to make dinner. During dinner she starts to tell a story about something she said both my sister and her did everytime we went camping previously. I had just about had enough of the old camping stories as I had been seemingly written out of them all for some reason and I literally couldn't remember anything happening how they said it did. During the course of this convo, I just mentioned that I didn't remember this particular thing she was talking about and that it was weird. I quickly realized I had said the wrong thing and when she got defensive I reworded to say that it was just weird how people remember things differently. Looking back, this doesn't seem like a conversation that should have been a big deal or upsetting between family members, particularly between a mother and daughter.

The rest of the evening seems to be going well as we sit around the campfire, make smores, and make up stories with my daughters. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves at this point and I'm relieved because I thought the earlier tension had passed.

DH and I get our girls ready for bed and get them settled in our tent and then rejoin my mom at the campfire to have a beer and hangout for a bit. After a while, seemingly randomly as it didn't really have anything to do with what we had been talking about, my mom asks me to ""tell the truth"" about an accident my younger sister had years and years ago when my parents had brought us sledding at, you guessed it, that very campground. I can't remember our ages at the time, but for some reason my mind seems to think my sis was about 7ish, which would have made me about 10 at the time. 

This campground has a sled hill, and when it snowed heavily, they would cut a path down the hill in one spot and run water down it to freeze it. When we went, many people were taking turns riding their sleds down this ice path. My parents allowed my sister and I to go down it together and mid ride our sled flipped, we fell out, and my sister hit her head on the ice. This was the first concussion out of three that she sustained before the age of 18. Anyway, my mom asked me to tell her the truth: did I push my sister out of the sled and hurt her on purpose? 

I didn't know what to say to this, so I asked if she was serious. She said, yes, she had just always wondered how we had gotten into the ""bobsled track"" in the first place and wondered if I had done it on purpose. I got defensive. I asked her if she was seriously blaming me, as a child in this scenario, rather than taking responsibility as the supervising adult who allowed us to ride our sled down this path in the first place. (To be clear, it obviously wasn't anyone's fault. It was an unfortunate accident.) When she realized that I was seriously upset that she had even hinted at accusing me of purposefully injuring my little sister in a sledding accident and that I wasn't going to back down and just let this go, she claimed that DH and I take everything way too seriously and she was just joking. (Hubby had been defending me and asking my mom if she even knew what she was insinuating because he knew I was becoming increasingly upset.)

I told her that it didn't seem like a joke, and if it was in fact one, not only was it not funny but it was in very poor taste. This is when she goes off. She basically says that since my dad left, we had been nothing but ""hateful"" to her all day and she wasn't going to put up with it anymore. In fact, we are always hateful towards her, make jokes at her expense, and ""gang up"" on her in every conversation to belittle her and make her feel stupid.

Guys, this was literally so out of left field that I was so shocked, as was DH. We didn't know what to say. I told her that I didn't realize she had felt this way, and all day long we thought we had just been making conversation and joking back and forth. The thing about my mom is that nearly everything out of her mouth is a ""joke"" of some sort or a snarky comment made towards you. This is how she communicates to everyone, so for my whole life, this is how I felt she liked to talk. So I do joke around back with her, but I generally always watch what I say, as my mom is the type that gets angry about some offhand thing you say but she doesn't tell you it made her angry. Instead, she holds on to it for nearly forever, holds grudges, and acts super passive aggressive. 

I asked her to give us examples of moments during the day when she felt we were being ""hateful"" towards her so that we could understand specifically what was not okay to say to her. At first she could give us no examples, it was just simply everything we said. Finally after we wouldn't accept that, she mentioned when I had questioned a memory when she was sharing a story at dinner, and my husband's earlier comment to her about the bread in her tote. To make it clear how ridiculous it was for her to be so upset over that, an example of a ""joke"" she made to me earlier involved mentioning that if I just wanted to take the girls to the bathroom or something, she'd go ahead and murder my husband for me. Said because DH had asked for help moving our tent because we realized we had set it up under a very large and very dead tree branch and decided for safety's sake, we didn't want our daughters sleeping under it. This is the difference between her ""joking"" and us being ""hateful.""

I'll spare you some of the details of this argument, but basically she says she's done with it, doesn't want to talk about it, is over it. Because that's what we do. We don't talk about things because she's incapable of discussing uncomfortable things when they come up. She ignores, holds grudges, and sometimes just seemingly cuts people out of her life. 

We won't let it go. We tell her that you can't just start something like this and refuse to discuss it. That's when she says that she had actually been planning to tell us something that only a couple people know. Something my dad doesn't even know, but now that this has happened, she isn't telling us. I'm thinking worst case scenario, like she has cancer again and she's dying and she doesn't want people to know or something. DH is great in these kinds of situations, so glad he was there. He kindly tells her that if she is uncomfortable, she definitely shouldn't tell us, in fact, he doesn't want her to tell him. But she should probably find someone she does feel comfortable talking to, maybe a professional who can help her through whatever she's struggling with.

Finally after some back and forth, she says she's going to tell us because she wants someone to know about this before she dies so that at least someone doesn't think she's a horrible person. She'll only tell us if we promise we won't tell anyone, and especially not my dad. DH removes himself and says he can't make that promise.

She decides to tell me why she no longer speaks to her own mother. She says her mother was abusive and that her mother knew about and allowed one of her older brothers to molest her for years. She said she became pregnant by a boyfriend when she was in high school and was too scared to tell her parents, so waited till she was 5 months. When she told them, she said her father let her mother decide what they would do, and she decided to find a doctor who would perform an illegal abortion. My mother had wanted to keep the baby.

To hear all of this was incredibly shocking and I felt nothing but sadness for my mom as a little girl and teen. This took over our discussion between my mom and I until I went to bed. I talked to DH in the morning and told him about all that was talked about and he asked if we had ever returned to our previous argument to clear the air, which we did not. Obviously after my mother shared all of this dark family history, it seemed pretty petty to try to loop back to our previous argument, and honestly, I was mentally exhausted.

It's been a couple weeks and my mom and I haven't really talked. I feel awkward and confused and I don't even really know how to talk to her and pretend like everything is just normal. I feel extremely uncomfortable that I know this info about my mother's past and my dad, her own husband of many, many years, doesn't know. After taking some time to think about it, I can't help but think that the only reason she chose this time to bring it up was to distract from the argument that she was annoyed we wouldn't drop. Why would she plan to share this info during what should have been a nice weekend camping trip with her daughter and grandchildren? If she wanted to share this with me, she would have had opportunities to do so privately. She doesn't work, and I'm a SAHM at the moment. She knows there are three mornings a week when both my girls are in school for a couple hours in the morning and we could have discussed this in a more private setting if she would have asked to meet up. Also, why does she refuse to tell my dad, but she was ready and willing (and planning?!?) to share with my husband? 

Also, this is all confusing to me because these family members that did horrible, unspeakable things to her as a child and teen were good enough to babysit my sister and I everyday. They were good enough for us to have sleepovers at their homes. They were good enough to be the people my parents wanted to raise their children in the event something happened to them. I've fortunately never experienced this sort of trauma, but I understand that she could have repressed these memories for years and thought that if she just ignored them, everything could be fine, and just now she's experiencing some issues with this. I told her she should definitely talk to my dad and she should seek out a professional she would feel comfortable talking to, but I doubt she'll do either.

I'm just so confused and don't even know how to talk to my mom, pretending like everything is normal and fine."
693,"First and foremost, I just wanted to thank all the support that I got through those that commented on the original thread. 

Let's just say things are not good at the moment. The insults have continued and they are getting worse. Now on top of the comments about my weight, they are questioning my intelligence by claiming that I am febble and slow minded and that thus, I am not a suitable match for their son given that whatever kids come from our union will get my bad ""genes"". That as soon as we moved somewhere, he should look for someone else and that no one would want to be with me. Even better, I have a habit of not wearing socks, so when I came over with my boyfriend to collect the rest of his things, his mother went on a tirade about how rude I was for not doing so...like seriously, they never comented on that before. Also, how I was not respectful because when her sister came to the city, I showed up wearing jeans and a sweater and that she was disgusted by my seeming lack of manners as in her eyes, I did not ""dress to impress"". Added to that, his mother was saying that he should be ashamed of being with a 200 kilo whale (my actual weight being 95), that no one would want to be with me and that he should know how to value himself more and look for another woman.

To all that my boyfriend decided that it was for the best to cut contacts with them all together. He apologised to me for the comments his mother made and reiterated how he had my back through all of it. I was in such state that I ended having an anxiety attack over all of this when me and BF got home. My boyfriend had to hold me while I was wailing about not feeling good enough, about how I hated that because of my ADHD my intelligence always came into question despite all saying the contrary, about feeling like a fat mess. I am still a mess and heartbroken. I don't know if I ever want to have a relationship with them any longer or if there are even any bridges to mend."
694,"I was cooking breakfast for my SO(M20) and I(F20) at his parents house. I was chopping up Jalapenos and other veggies when Pepper (MIL 65) came downstairs. She was doing fine until she noticed the slices of jalapenos and started coughing. 


""You can't be serious. You're not gonna eat that many peppers!""

It was two 3 inch jalapenos. Pepper hates spice. She'll go as far as adding a dash of black pepper to a dish, but typically under seasons everything she cooks. She also thinks it's unhealthy to eat spicy food and always goes on a triad about how I'm killing myself with all the spice I eat. 

So she was in the kitchen, coughing. Claiming that the jalapenos were making her choke. I stopped prepping my veggies and asked my SO to help me open the windows. In the fakest way possible she said ""Oh please, no, don't do that on my account. I'll just go up to my room.""

Her room is on the third floor. I asked her to stay but she said ""ooh no, I'd rather not be gassed in my own kitchen.""

So she left and I thought that was the end of it. Instead that was just the start. As soon as she got to her room she slammed the door and made a big show about opening her windows as loudly as she could. My SO told me to ignore her and that she'd get over it soon. Wrong. She started coughing loudly and yelling ""MY THROAT IS BURNING. YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!""

I didn't even start sauteing the jalapenos. Her fake cough and sniffling went on for an hour while we cooked and ate. We even added the peppers at the end of the cooking process to lessen the fumes they would give off. 

She came downstairs as I was cleaning the pans we used. She came up behind me as I ran a pan under the water and she patted me as hard as she could without it counting as hitting me. She said, ""now let's never use jalapenos again. You're like a fire breathing dragon, holy cow!"" 

I apologized, but she kept on going. ""You're like the weirdest person I've ever met! I've never seen anyone put down the spice like you! You're burning a hole in your stomach, not to mention you're killing your taste buds! Take it from me, your food would taste sooo much better without spice!""

Now, I'd understand if she was hurt that I didn't offer to cook her anything, but she's crazy about her food being done right. Whenever my boyfriend cooks for her she always makes little nasty comments like 

""Now I wouldn't hold a knife like that.""

""You shouldn't add that, that doesn't work.""

""No, you're ruining it!""

""You're gonna burn it! Turn down that fire!""

So I honestly didn't want to go through that, so I didn't offer. My SO did offer, but she said she already ate and was saving herself for lunch. So honestly I think she was being dramatic and trying to bend me to her will. 

Idk if this belongs here. When we have enough money to move in together it'll be the happiest moment of my life. I cannot stand to go over to his house sometimes because of her snide little comments on how everyone else is living their lives wrong and how she's sooo much better and smarter than everyone. I can't say anything without her adding her two cents on why I'm silly and that I'll grow to see it her way. My SO claims she loves me but I'm not sure about that."
695,"Follow up to this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bwxnbg/mil\_posting\_selfies\_with\_bil\_on\_holiday\_a\_couple/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/bwxnbg/mil_posting_selfies_with_bil_on_holiday_a_couple/)

I knew I should have trusted my instinct on what was going on at the time. Turns out that my MIL was talking shit about my BIL's dead mother just days after she died.  After the funeral, my SIL posted on social media a brief post about how her husband's mother was a ""great mother."" My MIL saw this post and freaked out - she texted my SIL that the woman was a ""trash parent"" and my MIL was apparently very angry at the post. Then she texted my SIL people whom my MIL thought were good parents and kept reiterating that the dead woman was a ""terrible mother.""

As a back story, my MIL hated the woman who died because she had apparently insulted her and said terrible things to my MIL."
696,"Still on mobile but it's through the app this time so hopefully that'll keep away the formatting issues; sorry in advance if it doesn't. So, I've posted on this subreddit once before. I was asking if FMIL is an Just No and the answer was what I had feared: a resounding yes.

In that post, I mentioned that my FDH had told me about a list she had made and added to as he grew about what his significant other *must* be like. He doesn't give a shit about this list and wouldn't even have told if it hadn't been for the fact I was being a bit naggy about why he didn't seem to want me to meet his mom. I would try to discuss ways we could do it and he would not be into that or really involved at all. He revealed that he didn't want to deal with the drama over how little I fit her expectations. Again, he didn't give a single fuck about her expectations; he just didn't want to light that fire before he had to. 

So what exactly was on this list? I'm honestly not sure I remember everything on it but I'll jot down what I can.

1) Your partner must love you.

2) She *must* be a women. FDH is pansexual and has had boyfriends before. FMIL has had the audacity to blame FBIL for this because, as the older twin and only male role model in FDH's life (their father wasn't around), *clearly* it was FBIL's failure as a role model that made FDH like men.

3) She must be black. FDH and his whole family are black. I am white and FDH has said he usually isn't attracted to black women.

4) She must be pretty. I have no idea what her idea of pretty is but I'd just about anything that I don't meet it. At least FDH says he finds me attractive and adorable.

5) She must be tall; like, at least as tall as FDH. FDH is 6'2"" (or 187.96 centimeters). I am 5' even (or 152.4 centimeters). FDH loves shorter partners as he finds them very adorable and cuddly. He loves near constant physical affection so we cuddle all the time.

6) She must be successful. I.E. She must be in school or already graduated. I do not have a degree and am not in school. I have two years of community college under my belt and desperately want to go back to school but life got in the way of my four year university plans.

7) She must have ambitions. She can't just want to be your wife and a mother. She *must* have actual career goals that she's working to. Both FDH and I want to get to a point where I can be a stay at home mom and, due to my own past abuse, I couldn't care less about career goals. All I want is a happy loving family that acceots me; that is my biggest goal in life.

That's all I can remember right now. I really have a nagging feeling that there's more I'm forgetting nut I know I got the major ones. I know FDH doesn't give a damn about this list but it just makes me sad. I had hoped I could be a part of his family but this list and advice from FBIL and his wife says that she'll never accept me as part of the family."
697,"First time poster, please bare with me. My JNMIL constantly projects her feelings or past onto my son and says I’m being a bad Mom. States I am constantly yelling, threatening and overall mean to my (Autistic patricianly deaf) four year old. My kid is an expert at ignoring me, not because he’s deaf but because he’s a toddler and well doesn’t listen. Like any parent you repeat yourself 40 times then eventually get louder until you threaten with time out, no TV, no favorite toy etc. 

We moved last weekend, had her over to help wrangle him so we could get things done. Obviously over time he got bored, wouldn’t nap etc. At that point we asked her to drive him around the neighborhood until he fell asleep (Usually takes 10-15min). Well they left, about five minutes later I’m taking out trash and there she is parking my suv all crazy on the side walk, flustered. He’s still awake, I get him out, ask whats wrong and he says “Mommy, are you coming with us? Are we going for a drive? Why is Grama mad?” ... Queue JNMIL “he was asking if he was put in the car as a punishment because he was being bad, I told him Mommy had a different way of dealing with him than I would of ” umm Excuse me? 

First off he has no idea what punishment means, what four year old says that?! And what?! Dealing with him?! He wouldn’t nap!!! It was for him to doze off.  So I ask “he said that? Because, he doesn’t know that word” and she said “well he said it and clearly you have no idea what you’re doing, you’re going to mess him up with all those threats” what in the actual fawk. I was livid!! Looked at SO knowing damn well he heard everything and he just looked away because his Mom is batshit crazy. 

She continued to be a jerk to my kid to the point to where she was threatening him saying she was going to leave because he wanted to run and play (she’s no spring chicken) which would make him cry so we asked her to leave. She left having a massive BF then turns says her good byes of hugs and kisses to SO and DS, then to me *super sarcastic tone* “Such a good Mommy” ugh like a verbal back handed slap to the face then hugs me bye. CRINGE!

She (supposedly) had a super shitty childhood and has talked on how her Parents verbally abused her or would leave her in the car so they could gamble (grew up in vegas) but she was also no prize winning Mom. SO and BIL not raised by her but she always ALWAYS has her two cents on how to raise my kid. My JYMOM raised me and only gives her two cents once in a while. 

Ugh she gives me heart burn!!!"
698,"I spent the night at my BF’s house yesterday and his family invited me to stay again. I said I’d think on it because I’d feel a bit bad since my bunny and dad won’t get to see me.

My mom texted me asking when I was going home, and I said I didn’t know. She told me to come home. I said I wanted to stay again but also wasn’t sure. She again said to come home because there were people there (her, dad, bun). I sent emojis in response but I started to overthink it and feel really horrible about it.

I think it’s because of what happened two days ago with my BF (I’ll just say he fucked up - no cheating, but he fucked up lol. Things are settled and we’re okay now). My dad is aware of it but encouraged me to stay to spend more time with BF and make sure everything is okay between us.

He called me tonight from work and I told him about my mom’s texts. He was pretty pissed. He told me I’m an adult and can make my own choices, and she has to get over them. He also said that if I’m in college, is she gonna be pulling this shit? Saying I need to come home because there are people there?

I know my mom wants to spend time with me, but most of the time it’s her criticizing me and my friends and gossiping about people, like her coworkers or my brother’s girlfriend.

Yesterday, when I went to get my stuff, she kept saying she didn’t want me to go and how I need to not have sex or I’d end up like her coworker (she’s pregnant. that’s literally it). She also kept saying I didn’t love her, only my dad and rabbit.

All of the shit she’s done, including yesterday and today, is really taking a toll on my dad. I walked into his room to talk to him and he immediately exited out of a website but I was able to read the screen before he did and it was a website about the symptoms of depression. It broke my fucking heart. My dad is the strongest, most wonderful person I know, and he’s taking a mental toll from all my mom’s bullshit the past 23 years.

About a week ago, I was on here looking at r/HappyCryingDads and sobbing over how much I love my dad, so I made him a card saying how I love and appreciate him and how no other father in the world compares to him. I left it on his nightstand so he’d see it first thing in the morning. He was very appreciative and he saved the card (he’s saved every single card I’ve ever made for him in my entire life. It makes me feel special, tbh).

I love my dad. He’s basically my best friend rather than my dad. He’s treated me like a person my entire life, unlike my mom who’s treated me like a nuisance and waste of money. I don’t want him to feel like a bad father because he couldn’t protect me from time to time from my mom’s bullshit. She always waited for him to go to work to do it. I’ve told my dad none of this is his fault and that I understand he can’t always be there to protect me from her. I have no resentment towards him.

What can I do for him? I always show love and appreciate towards him, and I stay home on his days off to spend time with him. I want to protect him the way he’s protected me."

My problems are no where near the problems some of you experience, but I finally cut off my JNMom. She's done a lot to my sister and I through the years but, being JN, she doesn't see anything wrong with what she's done.

She would storm in to my bedroom in the middle of the night when I was on the phone with friends because she thought I would tell our family secrets. She pretended to be me on the internet to my high school boyfriend because she insisted on having my Facebook password. She threatened to tell my family that I'm sexually active because none of them would love me. When I told her I was sexually assaulted, she basically made it a family secret and never encouraged 17 year old me to get help or report it because it was unnecessary drama. She had me lie to my uncles who cosigned my college loans when I switched majors because they would cut me off and I wouldn't be able to go to school anymore. She sat and wrote me a 6 page letter saying no one in my family wanted her to have me, they wanted her to give me up for adoption, and she's the only one who loved me. When I asked her to quit texting and driving, she slammed my head into the dash and tried to pull my hair out of my head. And I was the GC. 

My husband is amazing and supportive. He has encouraged me to be my own person and limit contact with her. My grandma and aunt, however, think I should forgive her and give her another chance. After she sent my husband a ridiculous text saying how I'm not the same person anymore and it's all his fault (because she can't micromanage and control me anymore), I quit talking to her for 6 months. The day my husband proposed she was telling my family about how much she didn't like him. I let it slide. But now, I'm 4 months pregnant and I won't anymore. She sent my sister and I these emotionally manipulative messages basically saying that she gave up everything for us and she's disappointed in how we act. This was the most minor thing she has done compared to others, but I'm done.

I blocked her number and on all social media. I changed all my privacy settings. I also told my family that I was done with her, they can't try to convince me otherwise. My little girl isn't going to be dealing with this irresponsible, selfish, narcissistic person and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of me. 

No replies needed, just wanted to share. So many of your stories have made me feel strong enough to do this. Thank you."
700,"My MIL is a SAHM and a definite helicopter parent she homeschooled all the kids went through all of their stuff, and pretty much controlled every aspect of their lives. This still effects DH because he's turning 20 this month and he's only lived away from home for about a year I didn't realize how badly this has affected DH until recently. 

Today we went clothes shopping and DH always goes for the same exact clothes which I never quite understand, whats the point of buying new clothes if all you're going to wear is a flannel and a tshirt? I asked him about this and he said MIL kind of just went shopping for whatever clothes she wanted them to wear and had him and his brother pick amongst themselves. This kind of explains why DH doesn't understand that he has to size up sometimes because he's so tall or because he has a big ass, hes literally never been taught how to shop for himself, he just knows that his clothes at home are a certain size which brings me to this point.

 Have any of your MILS been like this? How do you even remedy 20 years of this? DH literally doesnt know how to cook anything that isn't prepackaged or even go shopping for his own clothes because his mommy did everything for him. He knows the basics of cleaning but I have to teach him things here and there regarding that as well. It isn't that he's unwilling to learn either because we talked about it; its just extremely frustrating because he didn't necessarily think that there was anything wrong with this until I brought up that he should be able to tell if something fits or not and that he should probably have more in the closet than flannels and random graphic Tees."
701,"A year ago, I blocked my MIL on social media for cyber bullying and fat shaming me/DH. Things have continued to occur since then, but, for the most part, I've dropped the rope and let DH deal with her so it hasn't been that bad for me and I haven't felt the urge to post. 

In happier news in that time, we got pregnant and had a baby recently! LO is perfect and wonderful. We spent 9 months debating names to get down to a finalist at 39 weeks and truly decided on it once LO was in the world, but had not told anyone the name previously. I mentioned in the BEC thread last week that when the in laws came to the hospital, we told them we had named LO ""A B Lastname"" and MIL responded, ""I would have preferred B A, but I guess that's fine."" If I hadn't been lying in a hospital bed recovering from birthing a human less than 8 hours prior, I would have strangled her. 

The in laws came over today to visit LO. Instead of using baby's name A (or even her middle name B), MIL exclusively called her an entirely different name, C, throughout the visit. I finally said, ""why do you keep calling her C?"" And MIL responded, ""she looks like a C to me. "" I said, ""well, her name is A."" And MIL, who was holding LO at the time, looks into LO's eyes and says, "" C A."" I saw red, but managed to say pretty evenly, ""just A.""

DH of course missed this exchange as he was in the kitchen with his father at the time, but in describing it to him later, it seems to be one of the few times he's recognized how offensive his mother was being. Honestly, who critiques a newborn's name to the parents repeatedly in the first 2 weeks of their life?  

MIL didn't call LO any name that I heard for the rest of the visit. I know the whole exchange was some weird power play but I just wanted to scream. There were other BEC things during the visit but this really got me."
702,"Let me preface this by saying I know that often people fail to include the details of their shitty behavior in an argument, but I will try my hardest to be 100.

My mother, who I have recently realized is a narcissist thanks to this sub, put herself into an argument that didn't have anything to do with her. Very long, drawn out story, my aunt (mother's sister) and my cousin (not mother/daughter, cousin is daughter of aunt's other sister) got into a private argument that bled onto social media. My cousin was sexualized as a teenager by aunt's husband. He has continued to behave inappropriately over the years, going so far as to offer to pay cousin for sex, send almost obscene pictures (he claims they're sent accidently and are of the extremely lower abdomen without showing his genitals), and has been extremely inappropriate with her in public (talking about things he would do to her sexually, things he'd like her to do to him, being too close, hugging too long, and grazing over her breasts and ass). He's a piece of shit and everyone in the family knows this, even aunt.

My cousin was raised by our aunt, so she put up with the behavior because she knew that aunt wouldn't leave and would turn it around on cousin (because that's what she does when other women have come forward). She tried to have a relationship without including him, but aunt wouldn't do anything without him involved. Eventually this came to a head two years ago where aunt and cousin had a falling out after cousin came forward and aunt chose him. At the time, I was not aware the reason and I don't know if my mother knew. 

Recently, my aunt and her husband have been contacting people saying cousin is trying to slander him. They are calling cousin a drunk, a junkie (she had previously tried a hard drug 20+ years ago), and claiming she's not mentally fit to raise her twins. There has also been a CPS investigation that they are suspected of calling in after the falling out. When someone told cousin about the lies they are telling, cousin went to social media and publicly shared screen shots of evidence backing up her claim to aunt two years ago. Every single thing my cousin said to my aunt was documented and my aunt still chose her husband.

I supported my cousin publicly by saying I believe her claims, as she has undeniable evidence, and that I support her decision to cut away from those family members and anyone that stands with my aunt and him.

Chaos ensued, as I began receiving threats of violence from aunt's friends and children/grandchildren. My name was being plastered all over social media, so I sought legal protection and sent cease and desist letters to all I could. My name was removed and everything concerning me stopped, while it continued on for my cousin. I still showed support by commenting encouragements to her, but nothing bashing aunt and him. Admittedly, in hindsight this was a bad idea. At the time I thought I was providing support, it turned out I was adding fuel to the fire. This came back to bite my ass I guess, because eventually my mother contacted cousin, blaming her for multiple things.

According to my mother, cousin posting is responsible for him losing his part time job. Aunt's oldest daughter having a seizure. Aunt's grandson being arrested for theft. My mother not being able to sleep at night. My mother missing an important deadline at work. My mother being reprimanded at work for being on her phone. So last night my cousin publicly posted those texts to social media, as she has been doing for weeks with everyone that was attacking her.

My mother finds out about this and calls me, screaming at me because cousin posted her texts. I told her I wasn't responsible for that. She tells me to tell cousin to remove them. I tell her I will not do that as I don't control what cousin does. She tells me how cousin is ruining her life and it's a ""psycho"" and how aunt is the only one suffering because now everyone knows about him and what he's said. I told my mother that not only is he the only person responsible for his actions, but that aunt is just as awful as him. My mother began to defend aunt, claiming she can't leave him. I called bullshit. My mother continued to blame cousin for everything.

So I told my mother that if she says another thing to me, ever, about cousin, I will cut her out of my life completely. She hasn't responded.

I feel like I might have been too harsh to threaten NC since it isn't really ""that big of a deal"" according to most people I've spoken to. I feel that it's a huge deal because my mother blames cousin for everything going on since cousin didn't keep things private and cousin didn't go to the cops so she has ""no right to complain"". I feel like if it had been me, my mother would have still sided with my aunt and him."
703,"Backstory: I’m an independent person. Always have been. Not changing for someone that desires to be needed. My MIL kept buying us groceries when we moved out of her place (lived there about 3 months, just about lost my mind). I don’t need someone buying my groceries, so I complained to DH, he told his mom, she stopped. Then she got so mad at me and complained to my DH about me. Was overreacting and saying I hated her, and how she would basically stay 100% out of our lives. Not what I wanted at all, I just didn’t want her buying our groceries!!!

So then she texted this to my DH: “people throughout life help each other. She will find herself totally isolated from everyone if she can’t understand that. No one will ever want to help or take any help from her.”

All because I didn’t want her buying our groceries!!!

This happened a couple of weeks ago, and I think about this at least 3 times a day. I have barely talked to her since. I don’t think she knows that I know she said this. 

And the best part? My husband said NOTHING to her. I confronted him about it, he said “would you have gotten upset if you had never found out about it?” So yeah, I might have more of an SO problem than a MIL problem. 

Was MIL justified in saying what she said? How do I get over it and forget about it? I don’t think I can confront her about it, her and my husband seem to be over it, but I’m not."
704,"Obligatory I’m on mobile, sorry for the inevitable formatting mistakes. Also I’m pretty upset so sorry if this is rambling or confusing.

For the past few months (check BitchBot for more!) my MIL and my SO have been battling their relationship out over email. We’re traveling right now, and he blocked his mom’s number after all kinds of drama and hate toward us and our relationship. So, here’s the cycle:

—MIL emails SO some kind of “woe is me, I miss my son, here’s a random life update.” 
—SO responds cordially enough, grey rocks the conversation, basically just responds to whatever she brought up. 
—MIL asks if she can call.
—SO says “no, not if you continue to ignore the horrible way you treated me and [OP].”
—MIL freaks out, goes on some rampage about how he’s dead to her, he’s under my influence, he’s abandoning his family, he’s worthless, she thought he was raised to care for his family, blah blah blah, hateful shit.
—SO feels terrible, spends a few days in a haze of sadness and anger and confusion. He typically reaches out to his validating friends, texts his sister, and talks to me about how angry he is. We usually get really sad and spend at least some small amount of time discussing his future and I always feel a huge amount of shame and guilt for apparently coming between him and his family. 

So, considering all that, today, MIL emailed SO saying (condensed): “[Cousin] got married today. I’m sorry you don’t stay in touch with them either.” 

This is so confusing because SO wasn’t invited to this cousin’s wedding. He was once close with this cousin in their youth, but they don’t maintain a friendship anymore. Anyway, SO responded saying he was happy [cousin] was happy, and the cycle predictably restarted - MIL sent a series of long,  nasty emails about how SO has abandoned his family. Is MIL basically blaming SO for not being invited to someone’s wedding? 

SO told me he responds to his mom’s emails because he’s afraid that if he goes NC someone will die and he won’t be notified. He doesn’t talk to his dad so he’s afraid of not having a family. What do I say to this? I don’t ever tell him what I think he should do, and honestly, we both feel totally confused about what he should do anyway? 

He knows his mom is toxic/abusive and has said horrible things. After acknowledging that, what happens next?? 

The worst and somehow funniest part? [Cousin] didn’t even invite MIL to his wedding! Cousin’s mom invited her! LOL! What a perfect symbol for how dysfunctional this family is and how anti-independence they are!"
705,"So. I have not been on speaking terms with my mother or brother since the beginning of July. (Check out my AITA post to get the background of what happened) The last time I saw her she stormed out of the restaurant because she couldn't handle my dad telling me he was proud of me for having such a tough conversation. Then she magically got lost (despite him telling her to wait in the car within the block) so my dad had to leave me and go save her.

When I last saw her, I had firmly told her if she wants to have a relationship with me that remotely a ""real"" one, we need to go to family therapy. She said she wasn't in a place to do so as there was too much on her plate at the moment. I pointed out that's fair, but that just means it will be longer until we can communicate. I didn't mean it as a punishment, but more that that's the reality of the situation. Since then, I have been in therapy dealing with the trauma and abuse I've grown up with.

I also have been receiving letters from her. So, so many letters. I haven't responded to any of them, but it's clear to me from them that while she is sad we're not in communication and is trying and wants to connect, she cannot actually own anything. Everything is peppered with excuses about how her life is oh-so-tragic and undercutting anything that could remotely resemble an apology. My therapist has had to walk me through multiple and spell it out for me that only once in a dozen letters was there a line where she acknowledged my hurt. Additionally, I've noticed that while she has acknowledged the situation itself is bad, she doesn't seem to acknowledge or get that this has been a lifelong pattern of mistreatment and not just a one-off horrific moment.

Anyways, I've been nearing a point where I'm ready to write a letter to both her and my brother (two separate entities and very needed), when I receive another letter. In this letter there's more of the same, except this time she is going into my birth and how it was traumatic for her and she feared being a bad mother. I've known this. I have such revulsion with stories of my birth that I have an urge (but never say it this harshly) to tell people to ""shut up"" because I do not want to hear it. I don't even like seeing births in media, and being in hospitals gives me great anxiety (working on this with therapist, too).

So her solution with all this is that we should commit to ""co-healing"" with one another and do a redo where we get naked in a Jacuzzi and simulate me being born so there will be no more trauma.

Yeah. I feel like I'm back to square one with my letter and I'm kind of flabbergasted with how to respond or process this. I mean, WHY can't we go to THERAPY like NORMAL people??? And how does that address a lifetime of treating me like a scapegoat and projecting shit onto me? I dunno, reddit, what's your take?

EDIT: I want to thank you all for your responses. I've honestly been laughing reading your comments and it's been therapeutic and validating. Thank you for all of the support and kindness. I do not intend to do the ""rebirthing"" as my mom described at all, for the record. Just re-evaluating -- and metaphorically and perhaps literally rubbing my temples -- pondering how to respond in a way that is not lowering myself to her level, while maintaining boundaries I'm currently cultivating.

Also believe it or not, she is seeing a psychotherapist. I have my own opinions on this person, too, but my mom is a difficult person to get to go see anyone so the fact that she is doing this much is progress.

EDIT 2: INFO I should have provided earlier: I do not know if she's shared this ""rebirthing"" idea with her psychotherapist. I know from my dad she tends to downplay stuff a lot (and I've articulated annoyance with my dad for not asserting more that her behavior is way more problematic than she lets on). There is another person who is a friend of my mom's who professionally does ""radiance healing"" where she helps the person simulate being born so they can redo their own birth process in a safe space. So my mom is wanting to utilize this practice with her own take of her rebirthing me. I don't even know if her friend would be into this in the first place."
706,"I got such great feedback on my last post, and I’ve been going to therapy! Yay! I wanted to know if anyone else has been through this and what they found worked for them. I’m planning to speak to her directly about the situation on Sunday because I’ve literally lost sleep over this stupidity. Thought some more details might help make sense of her side, maybe? 

Some background: My SIL had a baby at 17 with a guy who completely abandoned the daughter. She’s nearly 12 now. She has severe ADHD, and although medicated, still lacks boundaries, empathy, and consciousness when it comes to her effect on those around her due to behaviour. 

My MIL basically raised that child since she was born. She lived with her until she was 10. Still spends many nights at grandma’s and so on. She calls her grandmother (my MIL) “mama.” She also has a full out bedroom with every accessory possible, TV, iPad, iPhone at grandma’s. (She’s obviously spoiled and has been allowed way too much freedom re: screen time, eating garbage, staying up late, getting whatever she wants, etc) MIL will literally spend $500 on wardrobes for her, it’s insane. It’s like she can’t say no to the kid. She’s required thousands in dentist bills from cavities, etc.

My SIL had a baby about 18mo ago with a long term partner. She kind of got a do-over. Didn’t breastfeed for more than a few weeks, daughter was in a crib in another room straight away, SIL likes to smoke cannabis and drink (not getting drunk at home, but definitely likes going to weddings and concerts and getting a little drunk!) MIL watches her 18mo old often, especially when the couple go out. (She also smoked a pack a day throughout her pregnancy and continues to smoke the same amount today, so her daughters have both grown up watching her smoke) Both those girls have had screen time since they’re old enough to hold their heads up. 

This is definitely completely the opposite of my lifestyle, as well as parenting philosophy. I’m in medicine and live a pretty healthy existence. 

I just want to clarify that I truly don’t care about my SIL’s choices (she’s honestly a sweetheart, just has shitty habits) — what I’m trying to navigate is dealing with a MIL who is used to playing mommy with her other grandchildren!

Besides breastfeeding, my daughter sleeps in our room, and I have ZERO interest in leaving her with my MIL. (I don’t see her very often, maybe once every 2 weeks or so for an hour. She’s extremely busy working a pretty big job and still helping out with the exhausting 11 year old) 

MIL really wants to watch my daughter alone, and we‘re having dinner together on Sunday where I plan to speak to her face-to-face and tell her that I’m my baby’s mother. She’s grandma. I have no interest in pumping for her to give her a bottle. She’s never even changed my daughter, I mean.. 

I know that she’s used to having those two grandchildren to take care of, but now she’s also telling me that the 11 year old will be able to babysit my daughter in the next year or two, and I’m just over it. 

There’s no way I’m leaving my baby with either of them. I know that it’s clear my MIL has no idea the behaviour she’s been reinforcing with my niece, and she would require therapy to work through her own mommy issues. (She was adopted and never knew her mother; my husband’s biological father committed suicide when he was a kid, and him and my SIL were under the care of hired help and then in daycare from the time they were only about 2mo old)

I’m not interested in my baby being watched by anyone else, unless it’s her father or some of my family back home. 

I finally have the confidence to tell her how I really feel. I’m a nice person, (shy) and I have a hard time standing up for myself outside of work. It’s really weird! I feel guilty because my MIL would often run errands for us when I was pregnant and even in the last few months (Costco runs, nothing crazy) Buy she will always offer to help with absolutely any dull or annoying task, which I appreciate.

It’s hard for me to shut somebody down who has done a lot to help out. I know she cares, she just doesn’t understand me at all; doesn’t know my baby, and I don’t feel as though she has any idea how demanding breastfeeding is since she never did it herself. It’s not my job to explain all of these psychological layers to her. I’m really good at defaulting to “JADE-ing.” 

I just want to be left alone to mother my child the way I want to without feeling pressured to hand my baby over for HER to feel whatever she’s looking to feel. She wants me to go out with my husband so that she can watch my daughter alone for a few hours, basically. 

You guys are amazing. Thanks for making me feel heard."
707,"Let me preface this by saying, my fiancé is a sweet man...but he's a man. We are getting married on the 26th of this month and I have essentially planned the whole wedding myself with very little input or effort on his part.

His parents have been ""struggling financially"" for a couple years now ever since my MIL lost her accounting job and just kinda decided to retire early, family be damned. She cleans houses on occasion, I think. Their financial problems were SO great, that they decided to take out a payday loan in my fiancé's name (him and Dad have the same name, dad knew his social). Didn't bother to tell us that either. They did this despite have a couple rental properties they probably could have sold and two older, more well-to-do children who probably would have lent them the $2000. Dad pays the interest on it and has maybe taken $500 off the principal in 2+ years.

So our wedding has been delayed for 3 years after engagement because we had to save up money to pay for everything ourselves. My family has pitched in what they can and my mother has helped me more than anyone.

A couple months ago, my fiance's aunt (mom's sister) tells me she'd like to host a shower. How nice! But then she precedes to send me 4 page long texts of shower planning talk while I'm at work. Several times. She asks for the addresses of all my friends and family.  I explained that my mother just had hip surgery and no one else could really drive that distance easily. Plus my aunt was hosting a shower for everyone back home. I really just wanted/expected this to be a family gathering for his side of the family. She wanted to formally mail invitations to everyone I know and I just didn't have the capacity or desire to do that. Maybe that's why it got cancelled? Idk.

Fast forward to yesterday, and fiancé casually texts me to say the shower, planned for THIS Sunday, was cancelled. I ask why and he says his dad told him that my MIL blew off the aunt and now they're mad. No other explanation. 

I made him call his mother when he got home and she said 'I don't remember what (aunt) said. It's really not a big deal"". 
I mean, yeah, not to her....but it's kind of a big deal to us 🤷 she then goes on to mention that Sunday is her birthday and we should all get together. I yelled ""I'm busy!"" In the background. She helped pick that date specifically. I even suggested that we don't do it on her birthday.

And here it is, the next day, and MIL nor aunt have called me to talk about it. I'm so done and will no longer join their family for holidays after this. Every year my mom plans in advance and works around what his mom tells her they're doing. Then, like clockwork, the week of said holiday she will change it to a time that overlaps with my family plans.

I feel paranoid to think that they do things like this to spite me, but I really dont see any other explanations :c"
708,"I live with my boyfriend’s family for now (we’re both 19), but we’re looking at apartments as soon as reasonably possible. Here’s the most recent thing his mom did that’s gotten me pretty upset. 

She needed a new car, so her and my bf’s dad, who can be pretty JN himself, decided they would find this absolute junker from 40 years ago and buy it “just for funsies” because it was cheap and so quirky and they just looooove it. Despite everyone telling them it was a dumb, broken car and bad idea. They haven’t even had it a month, and what a shock, it’s not working. The mechanic found oh so many problems, but they have to order the parts because they’re probably still made in only one place in the world. And it will take about a week or so for the parts to come in. 


So she pounces on me as I come home today and asks if she can borrow my car until she gets hers working (which hint, will be never...). I’m a little particular about my car in the first place because after living with my abusive parents who kicked me out, it’s like the only thing I’ve owned that is purely MINE that no one else can try to take away, because I worked for it and paid for it with my own money. It’s a safe space and a good car. But you know hey, JNmil has given me rides before if my car was in the shop so maybe yeah, I’m thinking she could borrow mine for the day while hers is being fixed. But then she drops the bomb about the waiting period for the parts to come in, and proceeds to tell me about all the other things she’ll need to do. This includes trips to bring bf’s dad back and forth from work everyday and probably bring him food or other things he feels he want, she’ll have to bring a friend to and from HER work everyday, she’ll have to go to the gym everyday and out to coffee with the gym buddies, she’ll have to do her shopping (she doesn’t buy food so she goes out to get food sometimes several times a day) AND she wanted to go to haunted house this weekend WHICH IS IN A DIFFERENT STATE and they’re trying to build a shed so she needs to cart cement and other building supplies around. 

All this because they PURPOSELY DECIDED to buy a shitty car that hasn’t even lasted a month. And guess what, I already share my car with my boyfriend so he can get to school. And I have work everyday. But we just want to make it the family junk mobile right now? The best part is that she has an older son who also lives with us who ALSO has a car...and she hasn’t asked to use her own son’s car. This guy doesn’t pay rent and only does Uber on his own schedule, so I feel like that would be a much better go-to than to me, the rent paying, full time working, already car-sharing girlfriend of her younger son. 

When I told my SO about this “proposition” he immediately said no. Not to let her borrow the car at any costs. First of all, the last time I let her use it for just a quick, “necessary” trip it came back to me with empty soda cans, a cigarette case, dog hair, and all my settings changed. So he says they’re not getting their hands on my nice car and trashing it like ALL of theirs have ever been. They probably won’t even cover the gas it would b guzzling. And still, why aren’t they asking their own kid to use his? SO says he will flip, because he was the loudest voice against buying their shit car in the first place and easily preventing all of this. So it looks like I’ll be pulling the “only insured drivers can be in my car” thing but DEAR GOD WOMAN WHY"
709,So I just found out from my SIL that my MIL is talking smack about us getting our child vaccinated. MIL has only recently become anti vaxx the last two years after joining a new church. She called my husband up yelling that did we even do our research before getting our child vaccinated. She's now claiming the government is using them to brain wash and mind control us. Oh and she said a flu shot is a waste of money.
710,"
Obligatory I’m on mobile. 

So, for those who’ve read my previous post on here, you guys know about The Bitch. She is my very JNFMIL. I swear to God this woman drives me insane. 

This woman has driven us up the wall in the last few weeks. So much so I nearly broke up with BF because I could not handle the stress she was putting him, and by extension me, under. 

I blocked her the night I posted on this sub, and it’s been mostly quiet, mostly. I say mostly because about two weeks ago, she throws a huge fit at BF for being on the phone with me all the time. BF tries to appease The Bitch, but alas, to no avail. 

It came to a head when she got extremely mad at BF because she believed he stole money from her BF, let’s call him J. BF got up to help look for it, but The Bitch kept screaming at him for stealing the money because he had 100$ in his wallet for helping J’s dad build a boat garage in a town five hours away from ours, making her think he stole it. He finally said to ask me about it because he’d been holding on to it for a date for us and was on the phone when J’s dad gave it to him. 

That’s when she got mad. The bitch pulled the victim card, claiming I never talked to her, I shunned her (I only did this after the fair incident when she threatened to disrupt my mothers place of business because she sticks her nose into everything and was going to tell my mom about the pregnancy thing.) 

She told him since he wants to live with me so badly he has 30 days to find a job, a car, and a place to live. Which wouldn’t be too bad, had she not removed his internet access. She tossed him the house phone, and a phone book. She also told them I was never welcome there again and if she saw me she’d beat my ass. She also told him she wouldn’t take him to any job interviews if he had them. 

At this point, I’m upset because BF is going to be VERY homeless if we don’t do something. He has no friends in our area and there’s no men’s shelters out here, there’s some in the next town over but he can’t even get there without a ride. 

Every year, our state gives us a little sum of money to live there. We used that to look for a car, and eventually we found one! It may be a bucket of bolts but it runs and drives. 

BF goes to pick up the car, and calls me from his new number cause he got a phone. I’m excited. This when The Bitch had to ruin my night. 

She calls me from the house phone, asking me where her son is. I said I don’t know because I really don’t, I haven’t seen him in 6 weeks (I need to get the car I’m driving fixed, and he needs to get our car fixed too) 

She then proceeds to berate me about unblocking her number, how she’s never done anything wrong to me, how I’m the one who’s shunning her, and that I broke the rules of her home. I have never held back such fury at someone, but I knew if I yelled at her like I wanted to, it would make things so much worse for BF. 

She commented on BF and I sleeping together, because he was shirtless and I was in a tank top and shorts because it was abnormally hot summer. We were sleeping, not doing anything else. 
“I was in a tank top and shorts, it was fucking hot in your house. Do you blame me?” 
I said, fully irritated. She continued and said that instead of coming over and earning “trust” back I just ignored her so I asked 
“I thought I wasn’t welcome over anymore. You told BF that yourself. And he told me.” 
She spun it around saying she never said that. (Yeah right you dirty old cum guzzler.)
She also told me that since I was in a relationship with her son I was in a relationship with the whole family, including her. Yeah right, if it wasn’t for you and your meddling ways, BF and I could be a lot happier, lady. Let me stress she never used BFs name in the entire conversation with her. It was s as always her son. Creepy possessive much??? 

Then J gets on the phone, and I feel immediately relieved, despite how I feel about BFs mom, J is an extremely nice guy and I really like him and his kids. We talked about how worried about BF they were, and that to just give them a call if I see or hear from him.

BF stopped by and he gave me a hug and a kiss and a pack of Magic cards. We opened them, hugged some more then we left. 

The next day, he wants to take me to work, to which my mom agrees (I live with her since I’m out of school now.) And after work BF is there to pick me up and so is my sister. Had no idea sis was there, no one had texted me at all letting me know and I only got a 15 minute break in which I got to use the bathroom since it’s a 5 hour shift. 

So I go with BF and forget to text my mom what’s happening. Slipped my mind if I’m being honest, I was just so happy to see BF I forgot. We stopped to try to get my prescription from Walgreens near my work and then he goes to drop me off. 

My mom, who is most of the time a JYMom, confronted me in front of my older brother, his friend, and BF about my miscommunication and about a condom in the trash from 2 nights ago. It was my trash from pleasuring myself, but I’m not about to admit that I’m front of everyone so I just said it ripped open in my condom bag and leaked. Mom was suspicious but I told her I wasn’t going to do that and I learned my lesson after my first boyfriend when I was 17, my ex now. I apologized to sister and mom profusely and asked if I can do anything to make it up to them, they just asked for better communication because I’ve had a known problem with it in the past. I agreed I will try my hardest next time. But I was thoroughly embarrassed and upset. 

I thought I was gonna relax and unwind after work with BF but his mom called him screaming about coming home to make dinner. I felt crushed, I wanted to have some time with him that didn’t involve driving or doing anything. He knew I was sad and promised after the care was fixed we’d do a date night, he promised and then he left. 

Then, BFs mom made no mention of the phone call to him when he got home at all, I later learned.

So that’s where I’m at. 

TL/DR: BFs mom phoned me with the house number,  berated me, contradicted herself, told me I’m in a relationship with the whole family, got a car, and had an embarrassing moment in front of my family with BF."
711,"I wake up to a text from DF saying that JNMIL has attacked him and kicked him out of the house. I have no other context than that because I’m not welcome in the house and he’s packing his stuff. We are also going on vacation tomorrow. She will be there.7 glorious days in a Caribbean destination plus her nightmare ass. Since I don’t want to end up in a  a Caribbean jail for murder. How do I handle this? I’ve been NC for a month and a half and life is grand. 
Just as an aside: DF is amazingly supportive and stands up to her bitch self all the time. She’s just so crazy it’s in one ear and out the other. I’m basically sitting back and relaxing as she ruins the relationship with him.


Update: 2 days into vacay and everything is going well. If I’m in the room she leaves and I don’t interact with anyone if I’m by myself. Been hanging out with the other sixty people and it has been so fun! Can’t say it isn’t awkward and I definitely would’ve liked some resolve before the trip, seeing as it is a family one. But c’est la vie!"
712,"TLDR; exJNMIL relentlessly bullied me into naming my baby after her ex husband and her son, who wanted nothing to do with the baby. Neither of them go by said family name either. I broke down after birth and gave in. 


I've posted before about my own mom but my exJNMIL is the real doozy. She's done a lot of horrible, manipulative things over the years that I may eventually write about but for now I'd like to share this story as another post from the other day inspired me to share it. No advice wanted as this happened years ago. I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. 


A bit of background:

I got pregnant when I was 15. I was uneducated about sex and contraceptives (thanks to my very religious JNParents) and sometimes shit just happens. My DS's bio dad was a very brief high school fling and isn't too involved to date, but we'll call him exSO for the sake of the story. His mom, exJNMIL is essentially my baby daddy thanks to a long and ugly custody battle orchestrated by herself, but that's a long story for another day. ETA: It is because of this court order that changing DS's name is not a possibility. It's my every intention to amend this court order as soon as we are financially capable of doing so. Thank you for all the love and support but please respect my flair. Thank you bunches! 



When I first became pregnant, exSO and his parents (along with my own) begged me to have an abortion. I was still very religious at the time (again, thanks JNParents) and was TERRIFIED of going to hell so I was adamant against it. For the record, I don't regret my decision as I love my DS to pieces, I only mean that I now understand that I had options that I didn't know I had back then. Anyway, I told them that they don't need to be involved and that I was having my baby with our without their support. To make a long story short, exSO was fine with not being involved but exJNMIL F L I P P E D when she realized that I meant what I said, and forced her son into a relationship with me in fear of not being involved with the baby she begged me not to have in the first place. Yeah. 

Fast forward a few months. We (I) find out the sex of the baby. It's a boy! ExSO, who had been disinterested in the pregnancy leading up to this, demanded we name DS after himself, reason being that it's his own name as well as his father's. Boohoo, I don't like the name and I won't have it. I laughed in his face, because he didn't even want the baby, so why would I name him after an absent father? The real kicker? Neither exSO nor JNFIL even go by their precious family name. Both go by nicknames. Think Dave and Davey for the name David. It's like that. 

ExSO proceeds to bitch and moan about the name but I still don't budge, so naturally he runs to mommy to fix it for him. In comes exJNMIL. She didn't come off too strong at first, just hints here and there that she'd like the baby to have the family name. I shrug her off, because who cares what she thinks. Once she realized I was blowing off her ""suggestion,"" she intensified. Every time we spoke, the family name was brought up. Every time, I said no, I have other names in mind but thank you for your input. Once she realized that she would not be getting her way, she unleashed exJNFIL on me (her ex husband. Yes, she wanted me to name my baby after her ex husband that she can't stand.) 

ExJNFIL, who was my ride home from school at the time, then began lecturing me every day about the importance of the family name. At first he would casually mention it, then progressed to full blown lectures, and then exploded to chastising me daily about the damn name. I got so fed up that I started taking the city bus home at 7 months pregnant in 100F degree weather, with the nearest bus stop being a mile from my school and over a hill. I was miserable but it was better than being berated by a loony middle aged man on the daily. 

At this point I was so mentally drained by their antics that I decided to compromise. I chose a name that kept the initials of the family name and would hyphenate the last name so that their surname was included. For example, if the family name were David Marshall Smith, the name I picked would be Devin Michael [my last name]-Smith. My naive 16 year old self thought this would suffice. I told exSO and exJNFIL about the name, and while they weren't happy with the compromise, they accepted it. All was well - until word got to exJNMIL. 

When she found out about the compromised name, she blew up my phone, knowing damn well that I was in school. By the time I had gotten out of class, I had 10-20 missed calls. By the time I was able to respond (lunch time), I had up to 50 missed calls along with walls and walls of angry texts. How could I be so selfish? This isn't all about me! Don't I value tradition? Why do I hate them?! I have no respect for family! I was pissed off at this point but was a scared and spineless teen, so I told her I'd think about it. 

Fast forward to the birth. It was long (26 hours) and very traumatic. I had to have an emergency c-section and was scared to death. I didn't want my exJNMIL there at all but she barged her way in (yet another story for another post) and dragged exJNFIL and exSO with her. Without getting into too much detail, I essentially went into shock and was therefore unable to declare who I wanted to bring into the operating room with me (I wanted it to be my BFF who was there with me even before my exSO's family got there), so the nurses basically threw a mask at my exSO and said ""let's go"" and he reluctantly went, according to my BFF. The next moments that I can recall after that are hazy as I was so heavily medicated, but I remember begging to hold my baby in one moment and then crying as I watched my newborn DS being handed to my exSO, and the look of disgust on my exSO's face. 

The next day comes and I'm in recovery. I had completely forgotten about exJNMIL and the family name drama because hello, new baby. The time comes to sign the birth certificate and I'm ready to write down my chosen compromised name when exSO pipes up about the god damned name. I said no, he threw a fit and called his mommy. She berated me over the phone not 24 hours after giving birth, I couldn't get a word in edgewise, exSO was not backing off, I was still out of it from the medication, I was exhausted in every way possible, and....I cracked. I was D O N E. In a moment of weakness, I wrote down the damn family name. I just wanted it to be over, to be at peace with my baby. My DS is now the third of this ugly family name that nobody goes by and I hate myself for it. 

From the moment he was born, nobody, not even my exSO's family who so heavily pressured me into naming DS the damn name to begin with, called him by his legal name. He goes by the compromised name I chose and prefers it to his legal name to this day (I gave him the choice to decide what he wanted to be called once he was old enough as I raised him to know what his legal name is for obvious reasons). So now there are three living generations of a stupid family name and not one of them go by the fucking name. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. If you're feeling pressured by a JustNO to name your baby anything other than a name you love, don't fucking do it."
713,"I posted previously about my JNMIL who is a baby grabbing monster. Last time we were in town, she ambushed my husband to let him know all of the terrible things I have done to her and the family. We put her in time out for an undetermined amount of time and have not heard from her since. 

We came back to visit my parents this weekend and to see my brand new nephew. We are staying with my parents and planned on avoiding his family. Well, after we have been in town for a couple of hours, DH gets a text from JNSIL saying “hey! I was just tracking [her fiance] and saw that you are in town. Can I see the baby sometime? Even if it’s just for coffee?”

Hold. The. Fucking. Phone. JNMIL and FIL require their adult children to share location but I was under the impression that DH had stopped sharing location with them. He responded that he will let her know tomorrow afternoon whether we can do something. I have made it 100% clear that I am not going to his family’s house and will not participate in any conversation that demeans me. SIL was not at the ambush but I am certain she has told MIL about us being in town.

I know the best thing to do is not go. DH is not convinced as he’s still in the FOG and feeling conflicted. My concerns are that she will bring other flying monkeys with her (or just MIL) or will make a scene and cry about how we are hurting MIL, blah blah blah. Thoughts? 

P.S. DH has now stopped sharing location. I demanded it and asked for proof.

ETA: I finally told husband that I was done enabling him. That I have no intention of seeing his family. I suggested he start actually feeling his feelings instead of avoiding them. I told him my stance on everything and that it was time for him to stand up and decide. I left him alone to think some more. When I came back, he said that he felt better after talking to one of my sisters (also a therapist) about some of his thoughts. He said that we needed to sit down and write out our boundaries. We proceeded to start a working document. He seemed to have a major shift in thought. While I know our work is far from done, this is a huge change. He seems to understand that boundaries are normal and healthy and that we can't force others or be forced to do anything we don't want to do. He has stated that he wants to sit down with his parents to clearly state our boundaries when we are ready. Again, I know there is more work to do, but I'm feeling better. Creating a list of boundaries is the sexiest thing he has done in awhile!"
714,"My grandma is a Just No. I’ve posted before about her bullshittery but deleted it out of fear of being found.

Anyways. I’ve lived in the same place for over three-four years. She makes this giant spectacle every single time she comes down to see me and DD. She programs her GPS to an address I haven’t lived at in years and then plays the whole ‘I’m lost come find me’ game. 

Last time she wanted me to drive twenty minutes away to go find her in a neighborhood. I told her to go ask at a gas station where x road was and she’d be able to find it. She magically then knew where she was and was at my place in five minutes. The bitch was right down the road she wasn’t lost just wanted to play games.

I fucking can’t stand it. 

She is on the way down today for a visit to act like she’s the best grandma in the world but all she does is talk about my weight. How my home is too small and ask why I’m single. She clicks at my child like she’s a disobedient dog and uses baby talk. 

She just texted me ‘lost but ok now’. I can’t. She’s not even here and I’m already viewing everything as BEC. I am not going to make it. 

I wish I could not see her but she is the gatekeeper for grandpa. And he’s not doing well health wise."
715,"Hi! New user here. Usually just a lurker, but for a while I've been contemplating about posting/ranting about MIL and I've finally worked up the courage to post. I'm annoyed by everything she does. I don't know if I'm overreacting or she really is annoying AF, so I'll let you guys decide.

I always got along with MIL before DS was born. She was nice, respectful, good company, pretty much a great MIL. My mama friends were envious of the relationship I had with her because it seemed perfect. During my pregnancy, she would cook whatever I craved and spoiled DH and I all the time. I thanked her for all the yummy meals and always was very appreciative of her efforts to be in our lives. I never saw anything weird at the beginning. 

Fast forward to baby's birth. I'm a FTM and was scheduled to be induced, which meant it was going to take me a long time to deliver baby. DH is a diabetic so he had to leave me every few hours to eat a snack. MIL and my mom stayed with me during contractions. At the 6th hour of laboring, MIL waited for DH to leave the room to tell my mom that I needed a C section because I was taking too long to deliver. Mom said ""No. She doesn't. She's fine."" 4 hours later, MIL keeps insisting to my mom that I need the c section. Then tells my SIL the same. Then she waits for the doctor and advises him that he needs to do a c section (LOL). Everyone ignored her.  She then sat down next to me and said she was feeling dizzy. Oh geez lady calm down. I'm feeling all sorts of pain and here I am in labor, so when DH walks in, I tell him ""Hey babe, go take your mom downstairs to the ER. She's not feeling well."" I waved her away like ain't nobody got time for her shit.

Then I'm getting ready to feed baby and DH kicks everyone out of the room. MIL proceeds to help him, but then she comes back while I'm feeding baby. DS son doesn't know how to latch yet and he's having a hard time. Finally he latches, but I have the postpartum contractions while he nurses. Meanwhile, MIL is standing on my left shoulder watching me feed the kid and stroking his hair saying ""Aw, my baby. My baby.' DH was resting so he didn't realize she had come back in the room. I was livid. I contained the urge to slap her because I'm supposed to play nice. 

Later in the day MIL told my step mom that we had a mess in our hospital room and that I should be keeping it clean for visitors. Oh because,  were all fucked if the room isnt tidy for them after being 17 hours in labor. 

My family didn't tell me about her behavior until after I recovered from childbirth. I was so upset, I mean I still am or else I wouldn't be writing this post 5 months later. 

We picked a Spanish name for our son because we're Mexican and we wanted his name to be pronounced by English speakers and Spanish speakers alike. She was quick to tell us that she hated the name in Spanish but loves it in English, so when Spanish speakers only ask her what the baby's name is she says ""Sebastian,"" but in English pronunciation. It irks me every single time because I feel she's just being pretentious. 
 
When baby was 3 months old, we let MIL babysit. It was bath day, so I left her the bath supplies and asked if she was willing to bathe him. She agreed. DH and I got back to pick up baby. DH stayed talking with FIL and I went to grab baby and collect things. I asked MIL how the bath went and she said ""Oh it was great! He had fun. We bathed him in the sink because we didnt have his bathtub. I would have bathed him in the tub with me while I showered but I had already showered."" Wait, what? Did she just say she was going to be in the shower naked with my kid? Weird, so weird.

 That same day she failed to put him to nap after we asked her to follow his nap schedule. Baby was overtired and kept waking up at night time. She had the nerve to call me the next day at 730AM and text me to ask me how the baby slept. She said ""Oh well Im sure he slept through the night because he just wouldnt take a nap at all."" Throughout our date, MIL kept sending is pics of baby playing at midnight instead of sleeping. 

So now, every little thing she does, bugs the living crap out of me. One day Im going to explode and tell her to just STFU. 

She always gives me unsolicited advice. Her talks on ""natural is always better for baby"" are so annoying.  Even though we already use most natural or organic baby products. We cloth diaper, too, but she still somehow always wants to put in her two cents on how her way is better. We havent even told her Im on Zoloft for PPD, so the day she finds out, she's going to flip. She opposes us supplementing with formula even when its only on rare occasions. She wipes baby back to front when doing diaper changes. She leaves the diaper loose in the waist, so when it's time for me to change him, he's already leaked through the diaper and his clothes are wet. I didnt even mention the time she overfed baby (15 oz of milk) in the 3.5 hrs we left him alone with her. Shes said ""He was just so hungry."" When I got back I asked her how she knew he was hungry and she responded ""Oh, well it's all the experience that came in handy."" I know, eyeroll. Kid was colicky throughout the night that night.


I have always been ok with confrontation, but all these incidents that keep piling up make it so much harder to talk to her about it because I would be backtracking for 5 months. Ugh. Am I justified in feeling annoyed and angry? What should I do? Also, DH is very passive aggressive with these things. He did talk to her about her comments, and she said she would do better. But he never pays attention when MIL says something stupid.

Okee, I'm done. Thanks for reading."
716,"Basically what the title says. FDH and I don’t visit with FMIL much since she lives several hours away in another state, but the few times we have she’s always had us squish together on this old tiny futon that FDH had when he was a teenager in a small room that’s essentially a remodeled pantry, and it’s SO uncomfortable... I’ve never had such back pain from sleep, and since we usually stay for a few nights at a time it becomes nearly unbearable by the end.

I assumed this was our only option for sleeping arrangements, until a recent trip when I went down the hallway where her and FFIL’s bedroom is in search of extra toilet paper. Before this neither FDH or I had reason to be in that particular section of the house and didn’t want to intrude on their space, but going down the hallway I passed an open door to a GUEST BEDROOM?! What?!? She’s making us sleep on what feels like a bunch of milk crates with a thin mattress on top, when she’s got a perfectly useable bedroom.... I don’t understand this woman. 

I told FDH and we asked her about it, she said she doesn’t want us in there because it’s “her office”... it’s got one tiny desk in the corner with a laptop which she hardly uses. Even if she did, laptops are PORTABLE, so she could bring it to another room!! WHAT A CONCEPT!!! If I seem frustrated it’s because I am. FMIL is generally a very nice woman but she’s definitely not the brightest bulb in the box, and it was already getting weird now that she dove headfirst down a flat Earth rabbithole which I talked about in a previous post. 

So now we aren’t sure what to do for future visits - do we insist she just let us use the damn guestroom? Do we spend extra money on a hotel and have her whine at us - which she inevitably will - or just deal with our current accommodations whenever we stay with her? I’d hate to make these visits even less pleasant, but I’m not sure what else to do at this point."
717,"A little background: my brother was staying with us for a few weeks. He has 3 kids. Oldest Niece is 3 and the twins M&amp;F are both 2. When he moved out and into my uncles house he took the twins but my mom kept the ON, im not sure why honestly. ON has been in my moms care a little over a month now.

Onto today. My mom had to watch all 3 kids for about hr and half, 2hrs tops because one of my cousins who is the regular babysitter for the twins had an appointment.

Well after having them all for such a short amouny of time she was such a nervous wreck that she just had to take her colazapam and rest for awhile.

(My mom never takes just 1 colazapam, she almost always takes 3 at a time, so when she told me she only took 1 i dont believe her.)

Anyways i come home at about 530/6pm to find her alseep on the couch, completely out cold. I had to yell to wake her up. I ask where is ON, she has no idea. ON can and will open up doors and leave. Shes very bad about that. So naturally im freaking out and searching all over for her. Turns out shes in my moms room and has it completely destroyed. 

She had aslo gotten into my moms bag of prescription medications, however very luckily she was unable to open them.

I snapped and screamed and yelled and just completely layed into her. I was NOT the least bit niece and i told her exactly what i thought of her and just how irresponsible she was.

She left my 3yr old niece ALONE and UNSUPERVISED for atleast 2hours while she was in a drug induced sleep.

The thing that makes this even more infuriating is that she REFUSES to accept responsibility for what she did. She keeps making excuses that she was just ""so tired"" and ""so stressed out"" ""she couldnt stop crying and she needed her meds""

She KNOWS that those pills knock her out. She KNEW there were no other adults in the house!

What would she have done if my niece got into something that hurt or god forbid killed her?!

Im so fucking mad right now.

Edit: i did text my brother after it happened but he didnt seem to take it seriously. I just got off the phone with him now to go more in depth and make him understand how bad this was.
He unfortunately can not take ON full time in his current situation but he is working to get his own place so he can have all 3 kids again.
In the meantime i will be confiscating moms colazapam and hiding it."
718,"This is more of a cry for help really. I’m not sure if I’m blaming Grimhilde legitimately or it’s more my SO. Please hear me out and I’d love to know your views. 

So quick background- Grimhilde is my Jocasta MIL, my SO has been her sonsband forever, she has another son and husband still around but she has openly said that my SO is “all she ever wanted and (FIL) can have the other one (bro)”. Yes she literally said “the other one”. 

SO has been in NC with her except for the few occasions where Grimhilde hijacks a phone call or email meant for FIL. Grimhilde routinely uses FIL’s emails and pretends to be him while writing with SO. I’m more VVVLC. 

SO has been in therapy and it’s been working well. Except we had the double whammy lately of Father’s Day and her birthday and he’s been going through this huge depression spiral. Lashing out, getting really drunk, screaming at me. 

Grimhilde’s emails go into a separate folder, marked as read and what not but I found out recently that my SO reads everything that she sends repeatedly and obsessively. 

I feel like even though we’ve gone mostly NC, he’s going through therapy, she lives on the other side of the planet ... she might as well be plonking her arse in our house as she is still very much taking up space in my SO’s head. 

Last night he got drunk and yelled at me all the shit that sounded like it was intended for Grimhilde but I was seriously intimidated and actually fled to my friend’s place to stay the night coz I was fucking terrified. 

Now I don’t know what to do. Is it her or is it him? Both? Maybe I should be posting in JustNoSO but I am really lost on what to do. I feel like all the progress and years of helping / supporting him at great emotional cost to me is now all for nothing. 

I’m really upset, I’m scared and I just need some help and hugs please. Please let me know what you think and what I should do. I don’t want to leave him but maybe should but I’m so scared of starting all over again. 

Thank you x

Update: he has since apologized but this is not the first time he’s raged at me. This is by far the worst though. And he’ll just keep apologizing but it kind of starts to mean nothing coz it just happens again. I want an apology, sure, but I just wish there would be progress. :-("
719,"*Hathor is my jnMIL.  She has a masters degree but no common sense.  She’s not a narc; she’s just batshit crazy.*

Today Hathor was visiting at my invitation to help wrangle DD (2) and newborn DD2 (2 weeks).  DD is starting to enjoy playing with legos.  She drug them out today and wanted Hathor to play with her as I was busy nursing the baby.  

Hathor then confesses to me that obviously, DD will never be president now.  

My brain short-circuited at that statement and I asked her to clarify.  

Apparently, an affinity for legos means she’ll grow up to do something tactile (ie science or engineering) rather than go into politics.  I just laughed at this and said I was sure DD could be whatever she wanted.  She’s two!   It’s not like she can even answer the question “what do you want to be when you grow up?”


I told DH what his crazy mom said when he got home from work.   He commented he thinks DD will follow in his path and become an engineer based on what she enjoys doing now.  

So apparently making wild guesses about my toddler’s future career is a thing in the in-law family."
720,"A few months ago, my MIL told my SO she would be visiting from interstate with SIL for my LO’s birthday. SO and SIL had had a falling out about a year ago and weren’t on speaking terms. 

I text MIL - with SO’s consent - to tell her SO was uncomfortable with this and could she please call him to discuss. MIL immediately calls me, told me that everyone should just grow up, and I told her to talk to SO about it. 

SO and MIL Don’t talk for months. I get a few texts from MIL to the effect of “tell LO X or Y”. In response to the last message I get along these lines, I tell MIL I’m not a go-between and to call SO to work out whatever is going on. 

SO &amp; MIL eventually talk on the phone. MIL says to SO she’s still coming down with SIL at a slightly later date. MIL then says, what right do I [OP] have to interfere? 

SO tells MIL I’m his wife and I am completely entitled to interfere. MIL also says I bombarded her with texts - I checked and I have sent no more than 5 texts over 3 months. I tell SO I’m angry and won’t be seeing MIL or SIL this visit. 

MIL and SIL visit. SO goes to see them alone. When ask how it went, he’s says “pretty good”. When I ask if he told MIL &amp; SIL if I would not be visiting with them, he says “it didn’t come up”. At this stage, I’m furious. 

SO then visits with MIL &amp; SIL with LO. 

We’ve just had a massive argument where he tells me to bring it up would just cause another argument, which is what I want, and that he doesn’t even want to be there and he knows I don’t want to be either, so what am I complaining about. 

I feel so betrayed and angry. Is my SO a JUSTNOSO, or am I overreacting?"
721," I read this on occasion because  I had a justnoMIL, she died fairly suddenly about 5 years ago.   Backhistory, my husband was “the baby”, my FIL is an alcoholic that I am certain was abusive to justnoMIL.   For that reason I always gave her a bit of a pass.   However, she attempted to control her very bit of my husbands life likely because she had little control of anything else.

We moved in together when he was 26 years old.  She had an all out temper tantrum and cried for weeks about losing her baby.  I became public enemy #1.    Before any holiday came around she started demanding that every Christmas Day be spent with her.   Then we got married, she was uninterested in most parts of that, but bitched about wanting to be included.  

We were having a baby, I was hospitalized for weeks for early labor.   She never checked in.  Baby was born, she was only interested occasionally.   At three years old  my daughter was hospitalized and had several major surgeries.   One being 6 hours long.    When we got out of recovery, my parents, sister and brother in law were there.   His parents did not come, because it was a “pain to drive into the city” but got mad if they were not provided with updates the second they called (as if we were not busy taking care of sick toddler)

We buy a house and remodel a bit, at the time she works at local big box home improvement.  I bought a shower head.   She must have asked my cashier what I bought because before I was even home she called my husband to tell him how much of “his money” I spent on a shower head.  (He laughed)

We have a second child, a son, the only boy on both sides.   She and father in law start the campaign to name child after FIL.  We decline, that goes over as well as expected (and as always the assume all decisions are made by me)

I could go on but things remain distant but relatively cordial considering.   MIL did not “do Drs”  so she left a treatable form of cancer undiagnosed for many years.  She is diagnosed and died within a week.   It was certainly tragic and nothing I wished for.    But I think the moment of clarity came when we told the news to my now teenage children.    They had no reaction, there were no tears, just nothing.  They didn’t know her because she didn’t bother with them.   They lost an acquaintance not a grandmother.   And now, these years later I almost feel guilty that my own husbands mother is not something we think about much.  There are no fond memories, it’s odd to me.   All because she chose to be so toxic and controlling.  

I vowed to never be that MIL.   I certainly won’t be perfect because who is?  Have not managed to perfect motherhood yet either.   I guess the lesson is when you are self absorbed and toxic, you are also easily forgotten and that’s a terribly sad thing."
722,"Naomi Cuntbell was a failed model in the 80's, hence the name. She was beautiful and her life revolved around that, until she got fat and crazy.

When she got pregnant with my ex, her second child, she booked an abortion because ""having a baby hurts too much"" but her doctor talked her out of it. She hated him for that. I saw her accusing him of ruining her body and her life, doesn't matter she started putting on weight only when he was a teenager, because all she did was baking cakes and eating them every day, it was his fault. Child1 was spoiled, would have big birthday parties, my ex not even presents, or was allowed to invite friends over. 

When i met her she said to me she knew i was trying to get pregnant so i could have their money, i told her ""i'm not like you bitch!"". She hated me with all her heart. My dumb ex was the only thing she had control over and i was ruining that for her. She would throw him out of the house for weeks, so he had to stay at my place. And then get mad and scream because ""he wanted to stay with me and not at his house with his faaaaaaamily"".

EXFIL was maybe crazier than her. He attacked my ex once and he had to be hospitalised. All she said was ""you were lucky we didn't leave you there to die"". And then she forced him to do chores and things that put his recovery at risk. He now has a disability because of that.

When we moved in together in another state she flipped. He was too young, at 27, her precious baby! She once got mad and screamed like banshee because she overheard us saying we lived together. We were just roommate, going on a brief adventure and then coming home, according to her.

She made a mission to get him back home. 
She called every single day asking ""so when you'll come back home? We are waiting for you! I'll make all your favorite food! Is the job over yet? Why are you staying there, you can't live there, it's cold! You are too delicate! You are going to be sick! When are you coming back?” for a year. Every day. She would talk to me and then call him and twist all my words. Even in front of him, until i refused to talk to her at all. And then his dad was sick, she was sick, the dog was sick, guilt trips, childhood pictures, crying phone calls, every day was ""you missed this and that"" 

Eventually she broke him with her manipulations. We started fighting every day, he didn't lift a finger in the house, he started blaming me for all his problems.

His parents had access to his bank account and one day she took all of his money out. They were filthy rich but needed HIS money for some ""emergency"" She left us stranded with no money thousands of miles from home. I had to pay for everything and never got that money back. She offered money only for a plane ticket, for him of course. According to my ex she was never in the wrong, i was. She was a master gaslighter and he fell for all her shit. So one day i decided i couldn't take it any longer. She wasn't going to stop and he would always be wrapped around her finger. I left him and moved out the week after. She was delighted to have her baaaaby back."
723,"MIL left me a voicemail lamenting about how she hasn’t heard from us and how she loves us and in the middle- starts speaking directly to DH and asking him if he remembers his dad (guilt trip) and she expects us to call her.  I actually thought she was drunk. (And he spoke to her less than a week ago)

I left it alone and told DH I’m going to let him deal with it. He didn’t contact her and was just going to ignore it until she called tonight and left him a voicemail about being very upset and she can’t believe this and that if she doesn’t hear from us tonight, she’s driving up tomorrow and burying our shit. 

Of course, DH calls her. And she’s starts going in on him with the guilt trip and he starts JADEing. She told him that it’s life and to suck it up and we should be contacting her weekly. 

Now she’s coming up Sunday to “clean our house” and “cook for us”. He’s still on the phone with her and I’m honestly contemplating pretending I was called into work that day when it comes."
724,"She messaged us after seeing a video of our son picking up a toy with his left hand in a group message (whole family) that we need to carefully consider the ramifications of a left handed child and to make sure everything he does is with his right hand. He’s a baby. 

She is usually so loving and delightful! Is this handedness thing really still a thing for some folks? We’ve sent her a list of successful left handed people and I’ve shared that I’m directly offended because I’m left handed and successful. We told her to never discuss our child’s handedness with our child (or make a comment to him about needing to use the other hand).

She’s gone silent for now. So weird!? Anything else we can do to make sure she doesn’t give him a complex as he grows up?"
725,"No advice needed, just laugh along with me if you need a laugh today.

So Calendar Girl is back from her vacation. She FaceTimes us last night and I set a timer for 15min because I'm that DIL now. I don't have time for her BS calls, neither does DH who cannot shake her off the phone in a timely fashion. When the timer beeps, it's time to hang up. 

And, go -

'Hiiiiiii babydoll!'

I'm heading into the other room and without skipping a beat DD, sitting in DH's lap replies 'I'm not a baby. I'm a child.'

I stop and stay to see what happens next -

'But you'll always be mmmmmyyyyyy baby! My baby girl!'

DH chimes in 'no, mom. She's telling you she's a child. She's telling you she doesn't want to be called a baby. She doesn't like it.'

'You're my baby girl forever my sweet precious beautiful little DD. You will always be myyyyy baby!'

'No. I'm not your baby. I was Mommy's baby but I'm a child now.'

Burn. 

DD gets up and leaves at this point - there was some awkward silence. Now she and I are playing in the next room, but we can still hear everything -

CG switches gears to telling DH a story that took up the rest of the time on the timer - he didn't get one word out while she rambled this gem. 

CG says she was in a major city and saw some items in a shop and really wanted to get one for DD. 

She kept stating the price -'it was (foreign currency)! That's $20! $20! An absolute rip off!'

CG continues - 'but it's okay I got DD something last minute!' - she picked some small piece of folk art - 'it was made by a real peasant!' as she proudly stated several times for some reason - and now she wants to frame it and 'give it to DD to keep forever and pass down to her children and children's children!'

Guys, I'm an artist. I have a day job, but that's my passion. Has been since I was 10. But the passion never paid the bills for me. It doesn't for a lot of artists.

I know this art was cheap because CG had to get in that 'it was only $5, can you believe that!?' and the way she kept saying 'peasant art' made me cringe.

DD's whole room is already covered in art I made for her, my best friend's art that she made for DD when she was born, and a bunch of beautiful framed pieces of classic art (Michelangelo, VanGogh, etc.) that I switch out regularly.

As she's trying to show this $5 'peasant art' she's so proud of to DH the timer beeps and DH cuts her off and we finish our night as a family.

Just, wow.

DH and I agreed on a freeze on contact for now. Even he can't take the crazy right now.

TL;DR - CG gets burned multiple times, timer beeps and CG is now in a time out."
726,"My mother in law is a total fucking pill. Like most of y'all can relate, I'm sure. It is that thing where she isn't complete garbage, but enough to make every visit and interaction some shade of hell. Well, miss-idependant I-can-do-anything-myself just bought a car with out any of her children's help...and it is a standard! She doesn't know anyone (accepting me) to teach her how and we live 8 hours away 😁 She can't return it and doing a quick Google search shows that she can't pay a local drivers ed to teach her. She might be able to find someone on Craigslist or something to teach her, but due to her being insanely neurotic, she would NEVER do that! She had the car shipped from the New England states somewhere so she can't send it back! I know it is probably shitty of me to take so much pleasure in this, but she just makes my husbands life hell sometimes and gives him terrible anxiety. If it weren't for her gatekeeping grandma, we would probably never make the effort to see her. For now, I will just keep this tasty tidbit in my back pocket 😈"
727,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence. I have been denied a restraining order multiple times. I have a lawyer. This is just therapeutic at this point in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got married at 18 years old to escape the thumb of TPP. Within a week of the marriage license being signed, he became abusive (she didn't know). She pestered constantly on social media that he needed to get a better job (and when she went on the public attack of him I had quite a few beatings) and I needed to quit MY job to go back to school. Here's some TPP Messages, circa 2010-2011, when I was 18/19. It's funny to go back and read now because all of the things she said ""i needed to do"" i now have with my new husband, but she complains about that as well. 

Emails, circa 2010, when I was in college and before marriage/right after getting married (but not telling her, because I had her in NC again). Also I didn't tell her I got married a week before my 19th birthday for a reason. I knew she'd pitch a fit, I wasn't talking to her, etc.. I'm not stupid. My dad knew. That's why she'd make new twitters and book of faces to harrass me because I had my new married name on there.. I mean I was 18-19 so I told her one day that some people just do that, we're teenagers, etc. Leave me alone about it (and I knew plenty that weren't married that had their boyfriend's last name on there, sooo). She told me only stupid people do that and she knows I'm stupid but I need to grow up. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she found out I was married, she showed up at our house. Our roommate was like ""your mom is at the door"" I was in shock because I had no idea how she found our house. She'd made a fake profile, friended our roommate and our roommate's girlfriend, and somehow weaseled it out of them.  

&amp;#x200B;

So she was like you're coming with me, i'm having you mentally committed, I went to the school (my COLLEGE) and you're not living in the dorms, I'm your next of kin and you will do what i say, and grabbed me and was pulling me to her car, my husband at the time was like we're married, you're not her next of kin etc etc... She went fucking berserk... Was calling my dad and crying because ""how DARE i make that decision without her""... 

&amp;#x200B;

The next couple of months was hell because we were in and out of court because I wasn't 21 and she was trying to force an annulment. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *The only reason I need to know where (Ex husband) lives is in case something was to happen to one of you i could get to you. Even if staying in the dorm I have no idea where to find you because you told me they put you in one dorm for the summer and would be there when school started back but then you said they moved you. I don't know where you are. I have nightmares most ever night that I can't find you and now I am having them about (my brother). I wake up screaming and crying most every night. I can not find you. I can't find (brother). One of a mothers greatest fears for her children is that some how your child disappears. I feel like I have lost my little girl. I can't find you. I am not wanting to controlyou. YOU ARE strong willed enough that I know what you decide in your life you should be okay. I am the one that fixed you and ex husband up and I do not regret it one bit. He is a good guy and I am glad he makes you happy. As his mate it is your responsability to push him to the best he can be just like it is mine to push you and brother to be the best you can be. I only want to be A part of ya'lls lives. So please don't let me leave you out of yours. I need to find my daughter again even if she is a young lady. I promise i won't interfer, I just need to be your mom.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *I hope your are doing well and i pray you don't forget where you come from and that you have friends and family here. I know you are having a good time right now in your life but don't let what you do now take you from the great times you had growing up, I love you.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *OP, I need to see a marriage lic soon or correct the (Former last name) on your page.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* *Please come see me soon. You are a grown woman now so please be respectfull of me and to me. Its time to learn to listen. We need to talk woman to woman and you not get mad about everything said. I love you.* 

&amp;#x200B;

In true TPP Form, she'd often spout things that made zero sense or had any connection to whatever we were chatting about. 

TPP: *You been married for over a yr and never have talked about things. I use to talk to my mom all the time. She didn't like (Mon's first husband) and my dad sure didn't but I at least could talk to them if I had someting on my mind. I miss that about us. Thats all!*

*When Stepdad tells me he wants to message you and your saying you are blocked I know you two had something going on. You and I need to talk, soon!*

Me: *Once again, about what??*

TPP: *Not on your cell phone messaging.* 

*Erase messages*

 *I will just delet you myself. you don't want me as a friend nor a mom. Do what the heck you want. You could pack his ass up ant tell his family to come get him and his bike and be done with him or you can  Stay with the no good low life and let him take you for alomony. Get your life back before its to late.  I hoped you would be the smart one but keep going like you are and you will end up JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER. WIth alot of bills and no job and a smart ass daughter with no respect for you! No need to reply, I am done with your being disrespectful to me.*

&amp;#x200B;

*When you are ready to work on a relationship, hopefully I will be around to participate.. If not, I have provided EVERY opportunity to make it happen and it will be on your heart for the rest of your days that you pushed me away. I just wish that you would stop the personal/character assassination attempts against me!!! I have done nothing but try to protect you and guide you as a mother should...  I love you and just can't understand why you hate me!  There is no reason for daughter and mother to be the way we are. I am not trying to tell you how to live your life nor who you should or shouldn't talk to. I have tried to not only be your mom but your friend. As both I want to listen to what is happening in your life and respond, thats what both do. I am not  judging you and I shouldn't be judged by you. I saw a text or two that you sent STEPDAD. 1st of all never ever say your coming to MY house in anger cause your tired of my ass making comments. I never made a comment about who what nor when you should talk to anyone. I did say be carefull about it. Nothing more. 2nd OP I was wanting to be a friend and a mom and you refuse to let me. If I give you advise its only from exsperience and it to give you a heads up on what can happen. If you do not want to believe me look it up, don't take my word for it.  I haven't been controling and do not want to because everyone needs to learn lifes lessons on their own. Giving advise is far from controling, its just advise. Making a comment is not controling nor is it putting down on you, its just  making a comment. You take my comments wrong for reason, its because you already know what I said to either be true or its what your already thinking. I hate knowing what the future is going to be for you but your to much like I was, everything except college I have been there and done what your going through or have already been through. 3rd OP I should be able to talk to my daughter about your relationship. You should be able to have me to talk to about things happening in your marriage or with work or with friends and just because I say anything back during the conversation it don't mean I am judging and its not controling, its just making a comment its just doing what friends do. TALKING, LISTENING, COMMENTS are just what they are, nothing more. You have been abusive mentally and cruel to me for years.  You have targeted me as the ""unloving"" parent that won't let you have friends. You have had nothing but love from me and you have always had friends and I have pictures to prove it. You said you wanted to grow up and want me to let you. Well do it but part of growing up is changing your attitude. Your attitude towards me shows pure HATE . You and I could be great as friends and have a wonderful mom daughter relationship if you would stop thinking I am trying to CONTROL you its just  talking like friends do. A true friend is a person that listens and gives their opinion , and listens again. Thats all I have tried to do, not control you. I am sick of hearing you tell others I am controling and I am hurt you tell people I was not a good mother. I busted my butt to make you happy growing up. I saw you cry when picked on about living in a trailor and I made that house your in now look as good or better than most the kids in your class to keep it from happening again. It was me OP that made sure you was treated equal to or better than others because I didn't ever want to see my daughter picked on nor put down on. I am the one that run to your school and threatened to kick whomevers ass when it came to you. I am the one that picked up 3,4,5,6, girls for sleepovers every other weekend or more. That took ya'll rolling, that did the hair and makeup for a dance or that sit and did dread locks with yall because it made you happy. When your putting down on me all these things rush to my head and wonder how can you treat me the way you do when I have always tried to be right there for you and I always will be. I have growed up even more the past few years and try to let you do what ever it is you do. Now its your turn to grow up and part of that is respect and stop telling others I am a bitch or controlling. Giving advise is not being controling. Its being a mom or its being a friend. Nothing more!*

TPP:*I have found the Divorce papers on line and printed them off for you.*

*Call me when you get a minute please*

*How can you afford an appartment when you have car note and payments to me for divorce , car insurance and up keep. Mom said your off again?*

Me: *Did I say I was going to get an apartment now? No. I said one of these days. Good god. I'm grown please remember that I know what I'm doing and I'm not getting an apartment till I pay my car off. No hurry on that.*

TPP: *Sorry I was going by what I heard.*

728,"
SO (29M) and I (28F) have been together 13yrs and we have a son (2). JNMIL is divorced from SO's father about 20yrs. She has since had a LTR with the man I considered my FIL. I still have yet to meet my SO's father; he was in prison, then deported, but we do have some contact.

MIL still holds a lot of negative emotions toward SO's father, always shares stories of abuse, neglect, etc. (I've heard a few sides of these stories; I still don't know the full story.) SO is the only one who talks to him regularly. MIL has manipulated the others, my BIL (30) and SIL (27) and they take her word so they are NC with him. They hold a grudge for his absence in their childhood, though my SO has chosen to forgive him and learn from it.

JNMIL has, on several occasions, attempted to manipulate my relationship. It took me years to piece together her behavior and find a reason for it. And then I learned what narcissism meant, and it fits her to a T. 

She has told us constantly that he is exactly like his father, that he should respect that he is now a husband and a father. She will use any excuse to call him out on his ""faults"" and exaggerate his behavior to fit her arguments. She feeds off the negativity. It's hard to have a kind, casual chat. I always try to share funny, heartwarming stories of our day-to-day lives and she gets bored easily. 

We had a disagreement around my SIL one time. MIL got word of it and called SO to say ""I hear you are acting like your father."" If it happens with her around, she tells everyone she enjoys our fights and her BF (my FIL) might get involved and provoke me to hit him. WTF.

SIL's wedding 5yrs ago: The drive home after shopping for decorations, it's just MIL and I in the car. We'd been on the subject of their father's absence at yet another milestone. She's venting about her relationship with him again. She says she sees how SO treats me so well and this makes her upset. Not proud, but *upset that it couldn't be her.* We visited with our son once after he was born and when my SO stepped out to get dinner, she told me to prepare myself for single motherhood, because it's a matter of time and she knows what it's like, and that she is only looking out for me."
729,"Okay time for an update. 

So a few days ago The Overstepper got kicked out of her sober living home and is being made a victim yet again. Why did she get kicked out? She was instructed to chaperone one of her roommates to a bar (not sure why) and had a couple beers while she was there. Obviously goes against the rules of the sober living home, I admit the guy is being shady with it but he had grounds to remove her. 

She couldnt stay with her ex-boyfriend for long because he is abusive and a drunk, so she was going to try to move to New York (one state away) with her brother. 

He wouldnt answer her calls, so she has no choice but to go into a detox then rehab and hopefully go into a halfway house. 

I am fully in support of this. She has needed something like this for a long time, and it's exactly what helped my mom when she went through a similar situation, and is now doing much much better. 

Therefore, I rewrote my letter to her to seem nicer. The old version was rather harsh and firm, this one started off with a more ""I want things to be better and I want you to be in our lives but I need to make sure itll be safe for me"" kinda deal? I dont know how to explain it without going into depth of the whole letter. I kept the boundaries and consequences short and to the point, and kept that they are not open for discussion or alteration. Non-negotiable.  

So FDH gave her the letter the night before last, when helping her go through her stuff to put into a storage facility, and see what she could take with her to rehab. 

I didnt hear much of it besides that she was a little bit ""pissy"" and was ""flabbergasted"" at some of my boundaries. The ones he pointed out were: 
- Do not take pictures of me, EVER.
- Do not hug/kiss on cheek/ touch/ try to get me to sit next to you. 

I explained in the note that some of my boundaries were serious trust things for me, and these two are some of them. She has a history of taking pictures of me when everyone (me, FDH, FSILs, etc) tells her not to, then POSTING THEM ON FACEBOOK. I blocked her on facebook the year before last because of it, and reported the image. 

The no-touching thing is because I am a VERY non-touchy-feely person. I think I have some sort of sensory disorder or something, I'm going to a doctor for it since I've never brought it up thinking I was just weird. I have to really really trust the person to feel comfortable enough hugging them (I dont with half my family even, especially if theyve wronged me.) She has broken my trust severely, I do not feel comfortable with physical contact or closeness with her right now.

FDH stood up for me, spine as shiny as it's ever been, and basically told her, ""too bad,"" same reaction as when we moved and he told her she wasnt allowed to know where we live. I seriously can't get enough of this man. 

So as of the moment there is still no contact, but as soon as we can get together we will, and go over everything again if we have to, then I will unblock her and see how things go. She can be as pissy as she wants, as long as she respects my boundaries, as far as I'm concerned."
730,"When I was pregnant with my first, he was also the first grandchild on both sides of the family. To call the future grandmas excited would have been an understatement.

My MIL rhapsodized endlessly about what a perfect and problem free baby my D(ear)H had been. She painted a fantasy picture of new parenthood that didn't exactly bear a strong resemblance to reality.

My mom, a mostly no who has since evolved into a mostly yes, began telling me what a difficult baby I had been. How I always cried and never slept, and how hard it had been to care for me as a newborn.

At some point in my second trimester, I had the brilliant idea that they could talk to each other,  obsessively work out their baby kinks together, and I wouldn't have to hear any more of it. So I gave them each other's phone numbers. I don't know what I was thinking, but I blame the hormones.

That's when my mom started telling me how she hoped that my baby would be just like DH and nothing like me.

What the hell, mom?

""But I just want you to have an easier time with your baby than I did with you!""

My bub ignored everyone else's plans and was premature, so our time as new parents was spent in the NICU. Eventually my mom came around to mostly yes and she ~~volunteered as tribute~~ did penance as my meat shield until MIL passed away a few years ago, her fantasy life fully intact and my nerves completely shot."
731,"Trigger warning: I’m gonna cuss a lot because I’m seething

Fucking WB. I had a sneaking suspicion that that fucking hag had posted pictures of my son on Facebook and that’s why I was still blocked. I nicely asked DH to scroll through her Facebook to satiate my curiosity because you know the wicked bitch of the West can’t block her baaaaby so he said “here ya go”. Then I fucking see it my cute chubby DS on her Facebook after we explicitly said do not post pictures of our son. We have to see her tomorrow and I’m livid. DH said he’d talk to her but I’m fucking done. I’m so pissed."
732,"First time posting, so forgive me if the flairs aren't right. Also, this is not a throwaway because I (26F) really don't care if my SO (27M) sees it. Maybe then he will see how manipulative his mom can be. This is long af because I need to rant.

Maybe I am just being overly sensitive, so if that is the case, please give me a reality check.

So it's Thanksgiving this weekend in Canada. We were asked to go to my SOs house for dinner. I genuinely like going there for dinner and mostly get along fine with my ILs (50s). I should also mention that SO and I are not married, but have been together for nearly five years and live together - so it's serious. It was implied that we bring something, and of course I am going to. I was raised to always bring, or in the least offer, to bring something to contribute to dinner. My parents (50s) are also invited, and this will be their third or fourth time joining for a holiday dinner. It's nice my ILs invite them, but this ""act of kindness"" tricks my mom into thinking MIL isn't shady.

My parents' offer to bring something, and so my mom is making a cheesecake. Anyone who has ever made a cheesecake knows that they are 1) expensive to make (my mom doesn't cheap out on ingredients) 2) takes a long time to make (for her it's like a 2-day process) and 3) don't feed a lot - maybe 10 max.

I offered to make buttermilk biscuits for the occasion. Recipe makes 12. All good, considering I was told it would be eight of for dinner (me and SO, ILs, my parents and SIL (F25) and her JustNO bf (M36)).

I read something on Facebook that indicated to me that maybe more people would be joining us for dinner. I text the group (me, SO, ILs and SIL) confirming numbers yet again and turns out double the people are coming...bringing the total number to around 15-16. This isn't too crazy, I know, but my parents and I are baking for 8. I haven't started biscuits yet, but my mom is already done her cheesecake because apparently needs to rest and whatnot (I don't know how/why/when she does what she does, but her cheesecake is THE BEST). MIL acts like it is no big deal, no apologizes or whoops.

I send a text saying: ""Not sure if my mom's cheesecake will be big enough to feed everyone now, so if someone else can bring a dessert that would be helpful!""

I should also mention here that SIL and her bf are not required to bring anything, nor do they ever offer/do. Her bf is 36, older than me and my SO, and doesn't even offer to bring anything. But I am, and always have been, required to bring something. The people coming we also not asked to bring anything.

I get a separate text from MIL asking if my mom can simply bring another dessert. GIRL, WHAT? How about you ask someone else to bring something and not treat my mom and I like the help? I sent a text to SO telling him that it would have been nice to have known about numbers so that we could have planned accordingly. I assume biscuits aren't that hard to make (it will be my first time making them - pray for me), but my mom would have definitely made something less time consuming and expensive. I'm not even telling her that more people are coming to save her from the stress.

So my mom and I (in addition to the ILs as the hosts) are expected to bake for everyone with no one else contributing. We have to buy our way into dinner.

Oh, and this is the second time MIL has done this to me. Last time was at Christmas when I made a mushroom wellington for what I thought was 8 people and turned out to be 20. I wanted to bring it as it is a good veg alternative to turkey/ham and 2/8 (or what I thought was 8) people coming don't eat meat. After slaving away for hours to make this thing, I pull it out and she snidely says, ""Oh wow, that's NOT going to be enough for everyone"" and I say ""Well, there are lots of meat options for everyone so I'm sure no one will go hungry"". Later, when the people who tried it exclaimed how good it was (not complementing her on her food) she said, in front of everyone, ""It would have been nice to try some, too bad there wasn't enough!""

Shady, shady woman. SO is convinced she likes me, but I know well enough that she is condescending af.

TL:DR: Snakey MIL requires my mom and I to buy our way into dinner, but fails to tell us how many people are actually coming until the last minute. This cues panic into the hearts of many. Not first time she has done this and SO fails to see how this is actually shitty.

\*UPDATE:\* Wow! So many comments. I didn't expect so many responses, but I thank each and every one of you for reading and responding to this post. 

After saying I was bringing biscuits and there would be no need for dinner rolls, I had to crowd my biscuit onto plates heaped with dinner rolls...so I was already annoyed as I walked into the door and saw the table. Well, that's not true. I was annoyed after receiving a text from MIL that read ""Hmmm.."" after SO and I were TWO MINUTES LATE. We literally got in the door at 5:02 pm and she was rude about it. Dinner wasn't even on the table yet. It's not like people were sitting around steaming food waiting on us. 

Everyone was obsessed with the biscuits and complemented me while MIL steamed in her seat. Mom's cheesecake was a hit and FIL was literally licking the tin. Revenge? Best served at Thanksgiving."
733,"I am the oldest and my dear brother DB (my mum’s only son) is much younger then me. I left my family when he was still in preschool.

My mom loves my DH, she respects him and we get quite along. She did lot of JN crap, but we dealt with that and she is now more on the JY side. Before I had kids, I spent few years in therapy to deal with my relationship with her. It took me a while to accept that the mother I wanted, was never there. Now she is for me more like an aunt and I am not upset about that.

But as for my brother - whole different story. She is very attached to him, he was always her baaabyyy and she was way more involved in his life that is healthy. Me and my sister we always say to her - leave him be, let him make some mistakes, he is smart, he can handle it. 

Despite growing up as special child, with all this attention, my DB is a decent young man, not spoiled, responsible and currently studies in different city. He has smart, lovely and beatiful GF and they are high school sweethearts. Both are young and full of life, lot of times naive, but who wasn’t when in their age?

Recently I noticed that my mom started to have remarks on GF and the time my DB spents with her and how little at home. Both GF and DB study in the same city and now they even started to live together in that city. I always said - mum it is normal, that he wants to spend time with her. BUt of course accordin to mum he should spent time with HER!

Last night my DH came home and told me a story. He went for something to my parents house and my mom was saying - Oh, I thought I could take kids (our kids) for sleepover (we were not expecting it), but “BH’s name” and “GF name” and then just showed her hand to the direction where my brother’ room is. My kids sleep in his room, when he is not home. And weird thing was she had this sour face and that she kept showing her hand and just repeating his name until he came out and said - are you saying I am not welcomed at home? He said it in joking way.
And she was immediatly like - no, no! Ofcourse you are welcommed. 

She is always so happy when he is home, prepares him his fauvorite food, and that is fine. But more and more she is becomming this bitchyJN towards GF. Like she is unwelcommed at their place. Of course she can be also super sweeet in a very unatural way. Sort of like my MIL was towards me, so I can really feel that she is just pretending.

She also makes comments about GF and her study “issues”. My DB helps her with studying because according to my mum, she can not study alone. GF and BH are in very different fields. But for a) it doesn’t mean she has “issues”, maybe he really is helping her, maybe they are just making out and b) it is not her bussiness! My DB is adult he can do whatever he wants. If he wants to spend time learning with GF or just be a moral support, then let him be. And I always say this same thing to her, but she doesn’t really listen and just keep repeating her crapy complaints and/or she says things like - “you do not understand!” or “it’s not like THAT”. 

My question is - how do you deal with JN relatives that are (mostly) okey with you, but you see they are JN to someone else?"

&amp;nbsp;

I'm in the middle of refinancing the house to pay off the cars and lower overall payments to help get back on our feet. I know we'll pay more in interest, but I have a plan to make a little of that back.

&amp;nbsp;

Wife and I of course found a dog that we loved before we even started looking for a house. So when wife's then boss decided to be a PITA, threatening to give the dog to a different family, we rushed to find a house. And MIL put her foot down and said we had to have a basement. I initially didn't want one because my parents' own basement was a mess, and the In-Laws basement had issues of its own.

&amp;nbsp;

But we HAD to have a basement for storage space.

&amp;nbsp;

The damn basement has had water issues since week 1. There were quick fixes made to correct it, but the house was built on a spring, so there is always water around the foundation. I later found out the builders had to use a big pump to keep the foundation hole empty of water.

&amp;nbsp;

After massive rains last week causing mudslides and closing the interstate, the appraiser had to show up with water still in the basement. Not much, and only in one corner, but definitely qualifies as dampness in the basement. So now I have to get a foundation inspector here to recommend repairs and the repairs have to be done in order to qualify for the refinance. FML

&amp;nbsp;

But we had to have a basement. And now MIL's sister is agreeing. The hell with you both, it's my money, and I'll buy my next house with no damn basement. That's what the attic over the second garage is for."
735,"I posted on here once before, but for those of you who don’t know, basically i’m 19 and in college. I have anxiety and am on the autism spectrum, but i think i’ve grown a lot in the last year, my relationship with my mom...not so much (see my previous post on this subreddit).  Also this post is tagged TLC needed but i’m also accepting advice. Any positivity right now would be greatly appreciated. 

Today i decided to hang out with my mom. I was in a pretty good mood today, but she kept making little digs at me (asking me to change my hair color because she hates the pink and trying to convince me to move back to our home state even though i’m in the middle of my college career). So, i finally told her how i was feeling. I told her that i felt our relationship was becoming unhealthy, i felt that i couldn’t go to her for anything and that i had to tell my therapist everything that i felt about her. bad idea. She starts yelling at me about how i need to be more grateful and that she sacrificed so much for me. she kept saying how she was homeless for me (which 1, she knows that topic triggers my anxiety, and 2, she was living with my sister and definitely not on the streets but we have still been struggling financially). But again, none of that is my fault, she’s the one who wanted me to come to college in this different part of the country so she could move here. she also said she doesn’t like the person i’m becoming, which makes me feel like shit. i’m doing well at school, just changed to a major i’m really excited about, i have a job, i have friends (which i’ve always struggled with) and i’m president of a club. I just feel so unsupported and alone. and when i told her some hurtful things she’s said to me in the past (she called me a freak) she proceeded to say she doesn’t remember calling me that? like wtf. She also said i was acting crazy (gaslighting anyone?) it was so ridiculous, like she would start yelling at me and i would get frustrated and yell back and then she would, in a calm voice ask “are you finished?” she even threatened to come up to my dorm room and pack all of my things. (which is illegal since i’m an adult). literally so aggravating. i’m so anxious to go home for fall break. i was in such a good mood today and she just completely bulldozed it and then told me to get out of her car. i know i was planning to gray rock, but she hasn’t been acting out lately so i kind of just put it aside, but i guess we’re back to square one. I just feel so alone."
736,"Hi guys. Me again. You may remember my mother as the one who got drunk in benidorm and told people about my secret wedding plans and then blamed me for making her keep it quiet.

Since benidorm my SO and I have decided to elope. We don't want the hassle and eloping has always been more us anyway. It's literally going to be just the two of us, nobody is coming with us at all.

We told BB tonight. She was upset. She cried. She ""feels robbed"". Apparently ""it feels like we were always so close, we went through so many ups and downs and it was all for nothing"". 

I went in there not planning on telling her anything. She now knows the date and the town where it's happening. I feel like such a failure. By the worlds shittest coincidence, she's in the area on the day. I'm terrified that she's going to try and turn up. I don't know what to do.

Edit: to everyone saying reschedule, we can't. We have two weeks of holiday planned around the wedding where we move around to different places. To reschedule now would mean cancelling all of that. I'm looking for emotional support here instead of just ""reschedule!""."
737,"MIL fell. She took a photo of herself covered in leaf debris and texted DH a pretty good chunk of text about it. Guess she tripped going up some stairs or something... so he asked if she was okay. 

She doesnt text back. 

Instead she calls after a short bit but we were eating dinner by that point and he said he wasn't answering it while we were eating. She didnt leave a voicemail and didnt text anything. I joked and said ""she probably wanted you to take her to the er"" (we live an hour away but I've noticed a sort of emotional/replacement husband thing going on that's escalated since FILs passing, and shes gone to the ER for a mere bruised toe before... DH didnt think my comment was funny)

Well... a short while later... DHs sibling texts from MILs phone to say ""hey this is (sibling). Her hand hurts really bad"" and that they're going to the ER. 

[My issue here is... MIL could text a photo and explanation of her fall but couldnt text DH back when he asked if she was ok? And instead had sibling text on her (MILs) phone instead of the sibling using their own phone? Is it just me or is that kinda odd?]

Apparently things like ""x ray done"" and ""all good"" is all it amounted to at the hospital. So she magically regained her ability to text play by plays. But then... he got repeated photos of her hand for a couple days to show off the little bit of swelling and bruising she ended up with, starting first thing the next morning.

I mean dont get me wrong I felt bad she fell and hurt her hand... I am not a total asshole here. But I feel this was such a dramatic way to handle it.... and I honestly truly wonder if her phone call was to ask him to come to take her to the ER. Wouldnt be surprised at this point... 

I am happy he put family dinner first though. This has been a huge challenge to find the line of ""supporting helpless widow"" vs letting her make herself top priority/make everyone do what she wants immediately. I feel like maybe we are starting to set some boundaries or space. If it was an emergency totally different but everything seems to need immediate responses (another post for another day with that stuff...)"
738,"For starters im 4 mos pregnant, was/still am trying to be very active- however every time I see JNMIL she makes the same passive *i think your a fatass* comment of “Are the doctors sure there’s not 2 in there... you’re belly is HUUUUUGE.”
every.single.time.
This has been going on since I started showing *eyeroll*

for seconds, she offered to buy the baby’s stroller. I had already found one I absolutely loved and put it on my registry (this was BEFORE she offered also.) it has a built in infant car seat you take in and out when traveling. She tells me at dinner that I don’t need that stroller that I should just get a reg. one that doesnt have a car seat because it’s just a hassle. And I’m like okay... whatever so I go searching for strollers and hardly any of them come without the car seat and the ones that do are forward facing AKA my newborn babe is facing outward not me which I’m just not a fan of. (DISCLAIMER I am limited to Macy’s because she gets a discount there. So not a ton of options) 

For thirds she asks me if I’ve started planning what to take baby home in. I’m like yes I got a cute outfit some leggings and a onesie and jacket. She undermines me with “well the best thing to take the baby home in is footed pajamas” 

It sounds so petty but this is years of bottled anxiety and dreaded encounters and passive aggressive comments and all my pregnancy hormones are making me crazy HELP"
739,"To start with I have to say that my MIL is 99% JustYes. Truly a lovely woman. FIL is a different kettle of fish but those are different stories. She is very enmeshed with her ‘church’ and goes by every ruling they make and pays them a lot of money to bless us and ‘remove’ any evil influences. She strongly believes in ‘unlucky years’ and if SO or I are even close to being unlucky on the calendar we have to send her recent photos so that she can take it to her shaman to be exorcised.

Anyhow, I’ve been with my SO for about 21 years. Spent in his country- which has a completely different culture and language to mine. Had a fair few cultural differences and struggles but it all tends to balance out in the end. We’ve been living together about 17 years and at the time this story takes place we’d been renting together about 12 years.

We had been looking to buy a place for ages. Visited so many open houses, consulted with so many real estate agents and at one time almost every weekend was spent house-hunting. His parents had offered us land near them to build a house but it was far from where we worked and I don’t drive. We’re both originally from farming areas so we had a hard time with the lack of privacy in the city. Time and time again we visited places and couldn’t agree.

Then we finally found our dream home. In a suburb, a churchyard (almost unheard of here) behind, comparatively huge garden and distance between neighbors. The garden alone we fell in love with- the house too felt comfortable and with some renovations would have been perfect. Finally we were sold.

Excited, we called our parents. Told them we’d found our dream home. An important thing to note here is that because of laws I cannot buy property independently. I have to rely on SO. Sent pictures and all that. Everyone agrees it’s a fantastic place. Perfect for us.

Yet, SO won’t put in an offer. I’m flabbergasted- I thought we both loved the place?
We did...but...

Apparently, though his mom had no other objections, that year was an ‘unlucky year’ on BOTH our calendars. She couldn’t in all conscience stay quiet and let us put ourselves in the way of evil. If we bought the house in that year we would both be doomed.

I raged and railed and just about fell into depression. I would have bought it myself but couldn’t because of the laws here. My SO wouldn’t budge - didn’t want to upset Mom- and I lost a lot of respect for him. In my mind he was putting her superstitions that neither of us believed in ahead of our progress. I was pretty much a bitch to him for almost a year. I almost left to be honest.

Then, after the ‘unlucky year’ ended, my SO said on Valentines Day that he had found a new house for us to check out. I had refused to do anything till the ‘curse’ lifted because what was the point?

We got in the car, he drove me to old ‘perfect house ‘ dropped on one knee and said he already bought it for us but for a reduced price as every other sale had fallen through.

Now he feels we (?) were right to listen to his mom because the final outcome worked out well. I’m not so sure..."
740,"Well, most of you said it would be within a week and oh boy you were right.

The first text was to just my sister in the morning. It was a long one that basically just said that she'll need to find a new roommate by January, and by January first the rent would go up to $2000 and there will be an added yard care fee. 

Legally in our state, the amount she is raising the rent on my sister is definitely Illegal. I also think, though not certain, that it is not legal to charge a yard care fee. It has to be either included in the rent, or just taken care of by the landlord. Either way it doesn't matter. My sister has found a place and will be moving by the end of November. I also have found a place for my studio, (it was previously in the garage of the house that mom owns) and I get it on November 1st, so I can take my time setting it up just right. The rent is expensive, but I think it's the best deal I'm going to get. I'm both excited and terrified. 

In the afternoon we both got a weird one from her: ""Not going to counseling...too bad your catch mom trick didn't work. In fact it backfired."" So my sister and I were a bit confused, and I was about to text dad to let him know he should check on her, when she sent another one that was just talking about how she's planning Christmas with my favorite Aunt and ""It would be nice if you could be there. I really doubt that we will be together by then. Not looking forward to the holidays without you, but realize that's just the way it is."" 

So, I think she's trying to use Christmas to get us to break, but jokes on her, I hate all the obligations that come with it and I'm actually kind of glad to have a bit of a break from it this year. The neighbors are fostering some adorable kittens, so I went over and snuggled them. Our neighbors are people we call siblings, and they have said we are welcome to come to their orphan Christmas. I guess every year on Christmas, any friends that for whatever reason aren't with family can come over for a relaxed brunch and just chill, play games, drink warm cider drinks and have a ball. 

My sister sent her an email last night that just plainly stated that officially she'll be gone at the end of November, and I will be as well. Mom responded this morning to her- ""Wonderful news, really. It's been long overdue, that you get out from under my wings. I view it as a positive and necessary move. I truly hope where you are going to makes you happy. I'm sorry it's under these circumstances, but necessary."" It's surprisingly a more mild reaction than I expected, but it's super condescending and my sister said she wishes she could just respond with a big ol, ""Fuck you!"". I told her, ""You weren't under her wing, you were under her shoe"" We are keeping the no contact strong though- my sister sends to me the things she wishes she could scream at mom, and we hold each other up. We'll be stronger from this and our lives will go on and it's be mom's loss that she doesn't get to be apart of them.

I'm trying to focus on the good things that are going on right now. I'm have been working a dream job recently, and I'm about to be interviewed as a direct result of that, so that's pretty exciting. I am having a 30th b-day party next week. My sister has been working with her DM (dungeon master from D&amp;D) to plan a murder mystery party that he has written. He sent us the basic setting yesterday and it's going to be so cool! The dream project I've been working on is having a fundraising party the week after that and I'm also super stoked about that. Also, I'm going to have a real studio, out in the world, with other artist neighbors working in their studios. I'm excited to not be as isolated from the world. 

On the other hand I'm also really mad at mom because since she decided to be mean, she's completely missing out on these amazing things happening in my life. Like, if she had waited just one more day to freak out about us not being in touch, I was going to call her and tell her all about that fundraising party I've been excited about. I've also been so depressed from this that I haven't been able to put as much work into that dream gig as I'd like. So, I am hurting but trying to push on. Thank you all for being an amazing support. I really always appreciate all the comments.

741,"Trigger warning talk about CPS and sexual abuse/pedophilia.


I know some of this is petty and some of this is serious, but I need advice to have The Talk (again) and potentially go NC. 

I lurk on my main, but need a throwaway since this is pretty damning. On mobile, apologize in advance. This won't be pretty but I appreciate any input. 

Ok so my boyfriend and I have a 2.5 girl. In laws are a mixed couple. BF's mom is Hispanic and Dad is white. Mom is from a black Hispanic country so she is darker. This is important in this mess. 


Here's the petty stuff (I think)


1. His mom wants to be called Ama. I go by Mama so I think it's weird. His dad goes by Papa. So it is Mama and Daddy and then Ama and Papa. 


2. They always change her clothes and keep the ones I send her in. I have to ask for the shoes, pants etc. They give them back once asked but I feel like I shouldn't have to ask?


3. They buy her clothes and never clarify if they are for our house or theirs. So if I give them back I get ""oh you don't like them?"" And if I don't then they ask for them back because ""she need sweatpants at their house"". Because the jeans I put her in are uncomfortable (which she has never expressed to me so?)


4. They have a day they get her. Like a custody plan. Blech.


5. They give her candy and juice. I know because she asks me for juice even though I've never had any at our house. I caught them giving her juice in a baby bottle when she was 2!


6. They baby/coddle her to the point she's annoyed by it. And they make everything a big deal to where they gave her phobias. Dogs and bugs. I worked hard to not make her afraid of bugs and am having to undo all this.



The not petty.


1. They have accused me 2x now of being racist against his mom. Once to my co-worker. Thankfully she knew they are dumb and told me instead of believing them. I'm happily dating her son. I don't think I'm racist?


2. They once threatened to call CPS on us. The wording was something along the lines of ""how do you think CPS would feel about XYZ"". Still. Who fucking says that.


3. They got so angry they left all of my boyfriend and our daughters stuff on our porch. Like a ""you are dead to us"" thing. This was after the CPS comment. They also got into a fight where his mom threatened to hit my boyfriend while he held our child. They knew they messed up. So they ""respected"" our space while crying about not seeing our daughter to anyone who would listen, like it wasn't their own damn fault.


4. After we made up they were asked to stop bathing my daughter every time she pooped. They argued with us and said they are going to keep doing it anyways. They said that is how they care for babies and that's that. When we said that's weird they immediately jumped to defend themselves as not pedos. Well no one made that accusation, but now I'm concerned! They were asked to stop bathing her because it made me uncomfortable about how often they had her naked and changed clothes. This one still really bugs me but there have been no signs of any abuse.


5. They feed her her allergens. They feed her things we ask them not to. They do whatever and will lie to my face that they don't give her sweets. The next day they tell me she's tired of rice crispy treats and had to switch it up. They gave her an allergen when I called the other day and he said ""oh...she can't have that right?"" So it's either malicious or just idiotic! 


So...there's my list. I think I am a good mom, my kid loves me, I love her and make sure she has a balance of safety and freedom to explore, she's never been starving, she's never been in a dangerous situation with me or her dad. CPS would not give us a second look if they did get called. I know it's just no everyone but it's mainly his mom instigating so I decided to post here. 


My boyfriend likes to have them watch her since it's free and we can get time together even just to clean sometimes. It makes me so uncomfortable anymore I never ask them unless I absolutely must. 


The racist comment was recent, yet to be discussed with them. That crossed (another) huge line and we will be taking to them, potentially to end contact. We already did once, until they ""apologized"" but I can't keep going back and forth.


 Reddit convince me to end it or not! Also what can I say to convince boyfriend too? He ended the NC last time. He felt it was time to move past the old stuff (CPS fight, bathing thing, candy and juice). Those new issues are creating the second round of NC (allergens, accusations of racism).

Thanks for reading and advising."
742,"Tldr: MIL found my journal. Found out that the reason for my infertility is group sexual assault when I was 15. Exposed me to my husband and the family. How do I deal with this monster in law of mine? 

Hello all, I posted this elsewhere too but got told to post it here as it deals with psycho mil's and their constant inability to have any sort of decent boundary with their Dil's. Not a troll, unfortunately. 

My husband and I have been together for about 6 years, married for 4. Honestly, hard work but the most amazing relationship. He's my cherub. I just love him.

When I was 15 I was assaulted by 3 men in their 30s and the encounter filmed. They served very short prison sentences. My main way of coping has been to have a diary in which I would write about my emotions, about my flashbacks and nightmares and just how it was being around other men with the past that I have. It helped a lot to get the thoughts out of my head and I could put the book away and pretend that all that had vanished from my life. It worked somehow.


I never told husband that I had gone through this as a teenager, I never wanted it to change the way he thought of me or treated me. I just didn't want to be a victim. But he never once pried. He isn't the pushy type, hes very laid back and quiet, he waits for me to tell him. I'm very lucky to have him. He's so strong and protective and just knows exactly how to make me okay even if I haven't told him why I'm upset. He gives me so much space to come to terms with things at my own pace before telling. He's just my absolute world.

Now my MIL, is a lovely woman. Baby crazy. We really do get on so well. Husband is the last of his siblings to get married and the only who doesn't have kids. Because of my assault, I can never have kids. I've made my peace with it. My husband knows I'm infertile, but not why, he wasn't really that down with having kids anyway and we moved along with our life just fine.

We are currently renovating our top floor in our house and all our storage that was there is just scattered around the house. My mil was helping me organise through them and in one old box of my clothes she found one of my diaries at the bottom of it. I don't even remember it being there, that box had been up there for years. She took it home with her, read it, found out the truth about me and just blew the hell up.


We were over for dinner and she just came into the living room where I was with my hubby, FIL, SIL and her husband and my Mil's sister. And she went off. Threw the book at me and started saying that she was going to finally tell the truth about me to her poor family that I'd deceived for so many years. That she'd always known the reason I wouldn't give my husband any kids because I was such a whore and any daughters we would have would also be having sex with men as kids. That it was clear the devil was in me. She mentioned the eating disorder I had suffered with and talked about and said I was clearly still starving myself to stay skinny for any man that wanted to sleep with me. She said I was evil, how could I have kept it a secret from them, they never would have allowed this much shame to be attached to their good family name. She just told my husband all this who sort of sat shocked speechless through it before standing up and taking me by the hand and leaving. My SIL literally had to drag her by her arm to hold her back, she was just screaming about how terrible I was and he needed to leave me. That I was an opportunist and he would be happier without me.


I didn't say anything to him once we got home. I just told him that if he wanted a divorce, I'd never stand in his way or ask him for anything in return. I'd just leave quietly and never be around him if it'd help him make things better with his family. He just cried and shook his head and just took me to bed and we just slept all cuddled up. It's been a week and we still haven't sat down and talked about it. We don't even sleep in the same bed, I'm not able to handle and I sleep in the spare room. And he's fine with it. I know he's giving me all my space and will wait for me to broach it with him. But I really can't. 

He blocked his family members on my phone and won't allow them to talk to me or to come over and chat. I did check through his phone and he had so many messages from his immediate and extended family asking what had been going on. MIL told them all that I had an orgy and filmed it with a bunch of guys and I wasn't giving him kids because I was a selfish slut and that she needed to find out if I was cheating on him currently because he wasn't going to be allowed to pay me anything after the divorce, or give me any family property or funds. The whole family knows now that something sexual happened with me and 3 men when I was 15. It makes me sick you guys. I'm so tainted in their eyes no matter what now. 


Its my worst nightmare. I know it's killing my husband, he just looks so stressed and broken down constantly although he's just being as normal as possible and treating me so lovingly like before and hasn't said a word about those texts. Takes me out and is just so sweet and caring with me, trying his hardest to distract me. And I know he wouldn't if I didn't bring it up. He's just such a sensitive, laid back guy. But I can't. I'm so embarrassed for us.

I'd appreciate any advice about how to deal with his mom please. Thank you in advance."
743,"Long time lurker, first time poster.  Throwaway account for safety.  The focus of this is my own mom.  If I am in the wrong subreddit please let me know where this post should go.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this community by chance one day.  I read through some of the top stories.  For a while, I found myself thinking ""This person is overreacting.  My mom does stuff like that all the time.""  It wasn't until later that I started to think maybe it wasn't that other posters were overreacting, but I was under reacting.  I don't know if she is actually that bad or if I am just angry and resentful because I am the one that is messed up.  I'm too close to this to get good perspective.  Please set me straight.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up both my parents worked full time jobs and sometimes two full time jobs at a time.  It wasn't unusual to go a week or two without actually seeing one or the other.  I understand now that hey were just trying to support us and get a little ahead, but they both clearly put their jobs first before anything else.  

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say we were never really close, but my mom THINKS she is.  To hear her talk you would think we were the best of friends and confide in her all of my secrets.  The truth is she's extremely nosey and has no sense of boundaries.  Like seriously,  I've caught her searching through my room even now (I'm in my early-mid 20's).  When I first got my phone in high school she would go through the phone bill and say ""you sure text this xxx number a lot.  Who are they? Are they your GF?""

&amp;#x200B;

 She would make it a game where she would steal my phone and try to guess the combination to unlock it or try to invent a reason why she needed me to give her the password.  Such classics as ""I need to call your father but my phone is dead.  Give me your password. "" or ""Hey I need you to google this"" and then watch really intently to see if she could see the code while I was unlocking the phone.  She did the same thing with my computer as well.  She had a HUGE meltdown once when I refused.  At the time, I was in a whole ass other country with my then-GF and I get a call that she needs the password to my laptop (which I didn't take on the trip) to do bills or something and she can't use the one in her room because my dad was sleeping.  I was over 4,000 miles away and I could still see the CBF..... But when I got back it was like it never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

She's also very manipulative and shady.  My parents went through a bankruptcy while I was in High School.  They wanted to work another job but didn't want it to look like they had more assets, so they faked it to make it look like I was the one doing all of the work.  I was not aware of this at the time but honestly I was so indoctrinated then that it probably wouldn't have raised red flags because I had nothing to compare it to.  I finally got tipped off when I found out what I thought was my savings account which I had been paying into literally my entire life I didn't have any transaction authority over.  Only she did.  I only found out when I thought I had enough money in there I could consider moving out.  Before then if I needed money transferred from my savings to my checking she always offered to do it because she had mobile banking and ""it will be so much faster"" Good bye thousands of dollars and hours at work. And the fun doesn't stop there.  Oh no.  She had been depositing ""my"" checks the whole time so ""my"" signature was hers all along.  Is it still considered forging my signature when I hadn't ever signed an official document before she started doing it?  Try explaining that to the bank when the only signature they have to compare it to was also hers.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there are the put downs.  They're never straight up insults, mind you.  But you can be sure she will mention my weight, my receding hairline, my current lack of a girlfriend, my fashion choice, or some completely new off the wall thing.  I get shamed for pretty much anything I do and everything that I am.  Then I get guilted because she has it ""so much worse""

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this post is already too long.  I'm sorry I didn't mean to rant this much.  Thank you to all of you that read this far."

So a while back, H's gpa got sick, hospitalized. My H's Gma did not want to be in her house alone so she invited H to live with her. Well, we (D and I) also moved in with him. However, at the time H and I did have D, but Marraige wasn't really a conern.

Well fast forward, after a few months, gpa passed away in the hospice center. R.I.P. sir. 

Gma starts in, if I had vacuumed, she would start sweeping the carpets the moment I turned the vacuum off and on a tangent about how she ""shouldn't be the one doing all this cleaning"" and ""that's what I was here for"". 

Now, I know I'm not perfect, but I feel targeted. Gma will sit and glare at me. She waits for H or I to be alone before trying to degrade us. She will say hurtful things in the snarkiest tone and then try to play it off as though she was joking. She has  tried to parent D, to the point  of force feeding her and I had to step in several times for gma trying to guilt trip D and once even raised a hand to her. (She didn't hit D. I stepped in)

""Well what do I even call you? You aren't his wife. You aren't married. You aren't engaged. So what even are you?""

""Some people just shouldn't be mothers.""

(she knows I've Native American ancestors) ""Well, you're Indian. You going to indian give like those others?""

""I can't beieve that child is H's because I NEVER thought H would ever ACTUALLY have a child so long as I was alive.""

""Here you go,"" -shoving over plate infornt of me at the table/sink- ""see, wasn't that nice of me? I gave you this. Here"" 

""Well, why are YOU doing THAT? That is man's work. I guess you're a man now.""

""Oh, look. -me- you're indian, look at that lady. Would YOU wear that? -pointing to an Indian woman wearing sari- Because I think if you move somewhere, you should try to blend in more."" I casually remind her I'm part N.A., not Indian, and thought the woman looked nice.

She pulls this style of casual rascism constantly, and has tried more then once to parent my daughter. She has a habbit of also standing 6 inches behind one of us at any given time, including trying to read our messages, picking up our phones without asking and while we are eating.

I try to understand that she is still grieving, her heart won't be the same. For the most part, I am the one who tries to get H to ask her to come out with us whenever we leave the house. I try to appease her however I can. I try to ignore most comments, but I refuse to let her parent my child. 

She has made comments before about how I must not have a sense of humor when she is blatantly trying to be hurtful towards me. I have tried my damndest to let this slide. I just feel like No one outside of the house can see through her manipulation and everyone keeps saying ""well, she's old. She's widowed. Of course she's going to be like that."" As though its a free pass....

Edit: I thought I should be more specific about a few things. These events have been going on for nearing a year, starting spaced out but becoming ever more frequent.

GIL and MIL's relations: MIL is not GIL's daughter. MIL is GIL's DIL, who was married to GIL's only child - a son, and H's father. I never got the pleasure to meet him as he passed away many years before H and I ever met. GIL and MIL are close, but that's more having to do with MIL's past rather then being blood. 

DD: The situation with the force feeding. Yes, GIL did say that we should ""just force her to eat"" and basically kept handing DD stuff until DD was ready to throw her plate onto the floor (you don't instigate a toddler) GIL tried to basically stand infront of DD holding bits and scraps in her shaking hands to see ""if she would eat because its from me"", and admittedly, I snapped on her in this situation. I did not allow her to actually force food into DD's mouth. I removed DD from her chair, told GIL flat out she's to never attempt that again and explain that is not EVER ok. 

Usually when GIL gets on one of these ""you are parenting wrong"" trips my only comment back to her is, ""Yes, well, she is my child. I will raise her as I see fit."" Or ""Well she isn't your child, now is she?"" And it puts an end to that for a few days.

MIL: That's a different story entirely, to which I may be making another post about because this woman's mentality is just beyond me and I can't even...

Moving out or Finding Care: We (H and I) are trying. We have to secure some for of work first and foremost due to not having a savings atm. We will be taking some of the advice from the comments and further looking into what care routes/elder services we have in our area, and what we can do to make things for our family unit better. We will know more about GIL's medical issues soon and, if it is what her doctors say, it may lean more to the 'she legitly can't control the mood swings' but that does not explain nor excuse her rascism or harsh comments. It does not given her a free pass, just may help us to better knkw what the next step is. At this point, we are trying. We are exhausted. And I don't foresee us maintaining this relationship with GIL for much longer if things continue to disintegrate.

DD is still young and thankfully not absorbing GIL's antics. DD is still that sweet lil one that comes up to kiss boo boos and hug you when you are sad. Of course she has a bad day every now and again or wants a freezie pop for breakfast, but overall, we are doing our damndest to protect her and redirect her attention away from GIL.

Lastly, Thank you to everyone for allowing me to come here and post this. Thank you all for the support. Honestly, its helped me deal with a great bit of anxiety from the situation. I know that the first steps to changing are going to come through myself and H. I just felt so defeated this last month or so that I started to doubt myself as a good person and that may be MIL and GIL were right. However, it's blatantly clear that this IS abuse and I won't keep being a doormat for someone else's amusement. We came hef to help her, and we can't do that if she won't help herself first."
745,"SO where do I start? Also I’m on mobile so the formatting might be wonky. I previously had a great relationship with future MIL. But that was, for the most part because I just kind of kept my mouth shut on topics I had an opinion about. I was young and doe-y eyed and wanted to impress his family so they liked me. 

Fast forward 4ish years later. We’re engaged and have a 4 month old. After the baby came that’s when things started to change. My filter was gone and I started to get a tad more vocal about things. Here’s a short list of the things that caused an abrupt change to MILS and mine’s relationship:

1. Came over to help babysit (which was much needed because I was going back to work). Preferred to rearrange furniture/things in my home without asking. I had also already established a routine and figured out how to clean and take care of things. She proceeded to leave piles of laundry everywhere for me to try and put away (I had planned to do once I got home). Got called arrogant because I asked her nicely not to worry about those things. 🤷‍♀️

2. Suggested we just go buy some formula when we forgot his milk and disregarded my choice to breastfeed when we’re coming up for a wedding. Got suspicious that she wasn’t feeding him just my milk when she watched him while we went to said wedding (I freeze in 3-4oz bags and his bottles were suspiciously watery and over 6-8oz when I checked what she had prepared.) She had her wood stove going in 68 degree Fahrenheit weather and caused my baby to overheat/possibly have a fever.  But was flabbergasted as to why he was so hot. Then proceeded to turn off furnace/stove and it got super chilly that night. Also had toddler over because she couldn’t not have both grandkids at the same time. Toddler had a fever day of the wedding and disregarded my wishes to be cautious and keep them separate (passes it off as another ear infection because she gets them constantly). Weekend gets over with and we go home. Sunday night baby has a fever. Second time baby has interacted/been near toddler and gotten sick a few days later. 

3. Newest biggest edition. I do Facebook often (probably a problem), I shared a SIMPLE post that said” love is in the air, so is flu season wash your hands (and don’t touch my kid)”. Innocent post, I added: “if you don’t wash your hands you don’t touch my baby. As a parent I have that right to take precautions for my child and I don’t care who you are.”  He’s already had a respiratory infection (coincidentally after the first time MIL brought toddler over as previously stated.) and I didn’t want that again. He’s obviously going to get sick, he’s in daycare. But to the friends/family that interact it shouldn’t be too much to ask for them to sanitize/wash their hands before they touch the baby. 

Cue MIL making this post: 

“My advice for control freaks   

1. RELAX!!! 
2. Get off your high horse!
3. Enjoy life Be Happy. 
4. Don’t sweat the small stuff! 
5. Treat everyone with kindness and Love family We are the ones who bail you out when times get tough!”

Am I overreacting to thinking this was aimed at me? Literally moments after I shared what I had shared. She’s said on the phone with fiancé when baby had his fever that “kids get sick” and not to worry and defending when the toddler had a fever and didn’t want to keep the babies apart (even if it was just an ear infection). My baby is 4 months old. Not 4 years. Not 14 years old. If he gets the wrong kind of flu or RSV it could be really serious. Yes he will get sick but I’ll be damned if I can’t take precautions. 

Or is it one of those things where the shoe just fits and I’m overreacting because she didn’t tag me or say my name."
746,"My MIL posted a picture of our daughter that our husband gave her.  It’s a nice picture and at first it wasn’t bad.  But then I saw the comments and she is still on about Disney and didn’t mention anything about my daughter’s birthday party.  For those that didn’t read before, MIL wants to do a combined birthday at Disney and I told her we are doing a friends birthday because  1. Our daughter doesn’t like grandma and 2. Our daughter really wanted a party.   So my question:  comment on Facebook how I already said no  so all her friends see or leave it be?  Woman doesn’t know technology so her Facebook is public.   I still love how she will include the dog’s birthday on who’s birthdays are on Nov.

UPDATE:  I like to thank all who gave me instructions to remove the picture.  The entire post was deleted by Facebook.  Hopefully my husband doesn’t mess things up and share.  I told him so he doesn’t try to help her thinking it was an IT issue."
747,"A little bit of background- DH and I have 2 amazing DDs. DD1 is 3 yrs and DD2 is 2mo. DD1 has recently started a developmental preschool so that she can receive speech therapy- she is speech delayed but showing great improvement.

Because of DD1’s speech delay, DH and I have always agreed that whoever does babysit (which is pretty rare anyway) should be fully trusted by us and know DD1 well enough to understand her. In the past, MIL hasn’t been trusted to babysit DD1. We have had some issues with MIL putting her wants in front of DD1’s needs. MIL is very used to getting what she wants, when she wants it. She also doesn’t understand most of DD1’s communication. We’ve addressed those issues and they’re being worked on.

Very recently, DH and my mom have encouraged me to slowly allow MIL to babysit more. Their point has been that MIL needs to know DD1 better to understand her, and that MIL needs an opportunity to prove she’s changed. Just a couple hours here and there and at our house. Most recently, MIL came to our house to get DD1 ready for school and on the bus while DH and I attended a dr appt for DD2. That time went over pretty smoothly. Well enough that we decided that MIL and FIL will be tagging along to an out of state wedding to watch both girls while we celebrate close by.

This being said, MIL has taken to nagging me about getting out of the house and letting her babysit the girls. She uses phrases like “Go have some fun with your girlfriends” or “Go get your hair done”. There are several reasons that doesn’t work for us.

I am fortunate to be a SAHM. This is my job- it’s not a vacation day to day. 
DD1 only goes to school half-day. I use the mornings to bond and play. Just part of 		our routine and helps reinforce speech at home.
DD2 is breastfed. I am horrible at pumping. What I do pump needs to be conserved 		for the times a bottle cannot be avoided.
Majority of my friends work at a paying job throughout the week. They can’t just do a girls’ day randomly. Those that are also SAHMs want to get together for the littles. Girls’ days are reserved for when dads are available.
DH loves his daddy-daughter time so I make sure my solo errands work with his schedule. We also only have one car at the moment.  

This has all been explained to MIL several times. But she still nags me about babysitting every time she sees me. (She has actually started waiting until DH isn’t around or paying attention to slam me with this.) I don’t know what to do. It’s not like we’re keeping the grandkids from her, but I’m also not going to rearrange our entire schedule/routine to satisfy her. And I’m tired of feeling like whenever we give an inch, she tries for a mile. I feel like this is MIL relapsing to only thinking of her selfish wants. But I’m not sure if I’m just being too sensitive..."
748,"Ok. So im on mobile sorry for any errors. 

My MIL is usually JUSTYES until it comes to her other granddaughter. (Which isn't even biologically hers) My 2 children are her only blood grandchildren. And her granddaughter is twelve. Well GD was left by her mom at 3 for drugs and men and came back when GD was 9. As soon as she came back she got pregnant with twins from GD father. She constantly favors the twins over GD. so when GD is here MIL favors her over my 2 children. (4 years and 3 months) It seems as if MIL attitude changes when GD is around. Yes I live with the ILS which 99% of the time works for us. I've lived here for 5 and a half years and just now this past summer got MIL to give up GD's room for my son. But she still refuses to give it up completely and the only thing that fits in there is their 2 beds. GD doesn't even sleep in her bed and has only slept in it 3 times in 5 years. GD has the biggest attitude problem and told me 2 weeks ago i shouldn't have had my daughter. 
Now DH (dear husband) doesn't put up with her shit and calls her out on it quite frequently. But GD is getting older and doesn't want to come over as much as she used to. (Used to be every other weekend and every holiday break from school.) DH got approved to buy a house and we would all be living in it but MIL wants GD to have her own room and my son to have his own room. Thats fine for now but what about when my daughter gets older? MIL said DD and GD could just share. I don't agree and we are now fighting about it. So my question is am I overreacting? I mean I understand its just a room but it bothers me also that MIL favors GD over her biological grandchildren."
749,"Just a rant about something my mom has done and it still on my mind and bothering me.

Sept 19 my mom text me at 8am asking for a picture of me, my daughter, and fiance. I didn't answer for the fact that I didn't see the notification. So my brother asked me if I was sending pictures to my mom and I was like what kind of pictures do she need? 'Us dressed up and looking nice or normal pictures?' 'What are the pictures for?' 'Who are the pictures for?' Questions so I know not to send her pictures of my daughter in her undies and us looking crazy. 

She gets mad and screams at me and tells me not to send the pictures then. So I don't, two weeks ago my brother tells me my mom is complaining that I don't talk to her anymore and I shrug my shoulders and say she don't talk to me either.

My brother is saying he's tired of hearing us saying we don't talk and he's tired of being in the middle of whatever it is we are having. I told him not to tell me that's she complaining about communication when the phone works both ways.

I don't know why it's bothering me so much but it is"
750,:)
751,"So my in laws are snowbirds. No big deal. My son is turning 2 mid November. Also have a 5 year old daughter. A couple weeks ago the week they were going to leave, She texted to let us know that they got our son a power wheels for his birthday. She wanted to know if we wanted to come over for pizza and they could give it to him. Again...no big deal. Well...it wasn't just pizza. She made my baby a decorated cake with a ""2"" candle and we sang happy birthday to him...2 months before his birthday. I'm having a REALLY hard time getting over this. I actually was going to let it go, but....a few days after she did this she told me that her and FIL wanted to come over for one last visit when we were all home before they left for Florida. She said nothing else. She had told me the week before that they were planning to come home early December for Christmas. Well....a few days after this birthday party she threw for my kid since he wasn't born when it's convenient for them....they showed up at our door like a circus with a crap load of Christmas gifts for the kids. No warning, no nothing. I'm quite sure my husband did not know about any of this. I've been so angry for like a week now I can't even talk about it. My daughter went to bed feeling bad that she didn't get anyone anything for Christmas that night which upset me even more. My MIL is like chronically sick, but she sure has a crap load of time to do all these things like frantic wrapping to show up a show and throw her own bday party for my kid. I'm so angry. I really need help here talking to my husband. All I told him was that I was processing everything that went down. My MIL is the type if I say something to her, even next spring/summer when they get home letting her know we wont' be celebrating my son's birthday in September every year, she will do her whiny, victim, ""I'm just so tired of being nice. I'm always nice and just get crapped on for it"" type thing. I guess my anger is real, but I need to figure out how to talk to my husband about this because it's eating me alive. And furthermore, do I even do a birthday party now for my 2 year old?? It would be my parents, brother's family and maybe like 2 members of my husband's family. As far as my son is concerned he was all into it and he thinks he's already 2. I'm so so so so upset. He's my last baby. I get all this be grateful talk and I'm over it. Throwing money at people doesn't make everything okay and that's how she is. None of this is my husband's fault, but I'm really lashing out at him over other things when this is the root of my issue right now. I don't know how to nicely talk about this...or if I don't and I just address the issue with her. I would like to tell her I need a heads up if she wants to host Christmas at our house again. I'm fine doing it in July or whatever but c'mon. You don't show up unannounced like that a half hour before bedtime and pull this. My husband didn't seem pleased. He's a real quiet guy though. His mom is a loose cannon and I think she always has been. We've been married 7 years now. She seemed okay after our first, but he's said in the past if she doesn't have one problem she has another so it will always be something with her. He also said last week that we won't be the grandparents that they are...he left it at that though. I don't feel it's my place to chime in a ton since it's not my parents ya know?"
752,"Hi there, I was advised to post here so here goes.
Met mil very soon after getting together with the love of my life, almost 5 years ago. Right from the off she terrified me. She is incredibly possessive of her only child. She treats him like her personal assistant and at times I have felt like the other woman.

Over the last five years, she has done many things. She has criticised my clothing saying ""you can't go out dressed like that, you will humiliate my son"". (I like wearing wigs and it was a green one, and she hates green). 

She has accused me, to my face, of tricking him into falling in love with me. She has told me I am a desperate and sad older woman who has trapped  her son (I am 8 years older than him).

We had a long distance relationship for 2.5 years and saw each other every other weekend, then every weekend, but then she emotionally blackmailed him into making that every other weekend again, because she needed him to help her with an acting course she was on. Learning lines, using the computer because she can't use one herself. There was a big row. She said to him ""if you loved me, you wouldn't make me ask. You're my only son and so you will fucking do what the fuck I want you to"". So I agreed for us to see each other less. I never complained, but my heart was wounded because of the way she would speak to him and take advantage of his kindness. (He didn't see that her words were manipulative).

She said that people who freeze up when being sexually assaulted are pathetic and deserve what they get, for not fighting back. (I am a rape survivor who froze up, though she doesn't know about that).

She found out I had an abusive step dad and mother as a child and later, used it against me and told me it's because there is something wrong with me and I probably deserved it.
She has called me a jealous and possessive woman, but all I have ever done is loved her son and he moved 200 miles to live with me. She says I love her son too much and we are weird for being so close to one another. 

When we have visited her, she constantly talks about food and nutrition and picks holes in the food I like or dont like and lectures on it. 

With her son, she will grab him and brush his hair. She tells him what to wear. She criticises his physique that he is not muscled enough. Even his voice is not manly enough! 

My partner is the love of my life and I his, he is perfect in every way. It has taken a lot of work to get him to use his own judgement and make decisions for himself without needing me to verify, validate or choose for him, because he has been so used to having decisions made for him by her.

She terrifies me. Bf is so kind, empathic and loving, in spite of his upbringing. 

Last summer, we invited her over for a weekend and it went really badly. She acted up and hated all the food we had planned because it wasn't the way she wanted it. She wanted to go bowling and have me cook a big toast dinner all in the space of 3 hours before her train home, and wouldnt take no for an answer, even when we tried to compromise with different food plans, just to fit it all in the time we had left.

In the end, she told me I was sick and twisted and I had tricked her son and she said he wasn't happy being here with me. I told her I wanted no more contact as it wasn't the first time she had spoken to me like that. There is so much more to tell, but the post would be too long.

Anyway, a year has passed and my bf desperately wants us to get along. Apparently mil has said on the phone that she feels she has misjudged me and wants to apologise. This was a month ago.

He actually convinced me to drive 3 hours to her house for the weekend, to get this apology, as I am willing to try  if someone is genuinely sorry and wanting to make amends. I fell over myself to be nice and act like nothing had happened, to make it easy for her to open dialogue, as I know how brave it is to apologise and admit being wrong.

She didn't apologise. In fact, she managed to have another dig that we are too close to one another and she thought it was unhealthy and that we should spend time apart. I didn't tell her where to stick that advice. Though maybe I should have. Bf and I are very close. We are in love and best friends, what is wrong with that?

Next week is our big five year anniversary and bf wants to take me to the restaurant where we met and recreate our first date. Which means staying over at his mum's house for the weekend.
I love the idea of recreating our first date, I am not so happy about staying at mil. Especially seeing as nothing has been resolved, it seems to have been swept under the carpet. Which just makes further fallouts more likely.

I have complex PTSD because of my abusive parents and my mil is very triggering because she shouts with a shill voice, like a harpy! She swears and has tantrums about all kinds of little things that wouldn't even occur to me to get bothered by. When I get triggered by shouting, I have to leave to remove myself from the ""danger"". Or I end up getting angry and telling her to stop shouting. Both of which I don't want to do.

I don't want to ruin our anniversary, but I am so worried and I don't know what to do. I wish we could keep the nc rule, but I agreed to try, for my bf sake."
753,"Hey everyone I'm the DIL whose MIL told her not to Insert herself into the situation ( I still don't know how to link posts ). Thanks to u/Lindris for the nickname it fits perfectly.

It's been 2 months since we last had contact with screamin' Demon and it was pure bliss.

We now live 15 minutes from the in-laws. 

Good news: SIL(MIL stepdaughter) and her boyfriend ( for shortening it I will refer to him as BIL2) moved in with the In-laws!

Bad news: the both of them are at fault for everything that happened even for the things they weren't present for.

Good/Bad: MIL told BIL during a fight that she "" already lost a son and she doesn't want to lose another.

I will try to keep this as short as possible but first a little backstory.


BIL2 and BIL made a deal a year ago. BIL2 will give BIL his old guitar ( BIL2 Is a guitarist and BIL is learning to play the guitar) if BIL either pays 200€ or fixes 2 bikes that are in the shed for them. He did neither 

BIL2 sometimes jokes about it and it sets BIL off because MIL pressures him to do one of the things he promised.

One day MIL just takes 200€ of from BILs banking account ( he can't access it without parental approval) and told him either he gives it to BIL2 or she will.

Of course BIL talks to BIL2 about it and BIL2 assures him he will handle it and he doesn't want the money as it was a joke and he didn't think anyone would take it serious.

So the fated day comes. Firstly MIL questions BIL about the internship he has to get for school and he responds honestly:"" I couldn't care less about it to be honest. I applied for it at a place and didn't get a response."" Both MIL and FIL went mad( FIL not as much ). Next on MILs agenda is the guitar issue. She forces BIL to give the 200€ to BIL2 and while doing so says :"" mom and dad decided that I should give you the money for the guitar."" BIL2 thanked him and said he should keep it as he never really meant it when he said that he wants something for the guitar.
MIL was really pissed now and screamed at BIL2 how he shouldn't interfere in her raising attempts and so on. While being screamed at something in BIL2 snapped ( he had a really hard childhood and his fair share of narcissists so this was really surprising). He just said:"" are you stupid ?"" MIL responded :"" what did you say?!"" And he repeated what he said while smiling and mocking her in a really cheery voice :"" are you stupid ?"" And she went really mad and said some things that she always says and ended it with her fake crying.

Next occurrence !
I don't know how it started but MIL pushed SIL while she was trying to get BIL away from MIL because he had a panic attack and MIL forced him to be alone with her and mocking him that he should stop faking it. What I should add is that SIL is basically untouchable as she is FILs favorite child (SO and BIL are fine with it as she had a really bad childhood and her own mother alienated her from FIL and they reconnected 3 years ago because of BIL2)
After she pushed SIL she fell into panic and told everyone present that SIL pushed her ( it was seen by everyone that she pushed SIL and not the other way around) and then she started screaming again and FIL was really drunk at this point drank half a Schnaps bottle in mere seconds threw up in the garden while MIL walked past him with her bags packed because she decided to leave the family and go back to poland.

3 days passed and she was back again even though she wrote BIL a message stating that he should decide if she should come back or not ( he never responded )

She ignored everyone, even FIL who always stayed on her side even when she went against him.

A few silent days later and she talks to BIL and tells him....SIL and BIL2 are at fault for everything and that they are destroying the family ( I wish this was a joke ). 

Now I initially didn't want to post this as I kept a low profile ( last Friday I escaped MIL in a supermarket and hid in an aisle for 15 minutes until she was gone as I had no intention to see her or talk to her )
Last Sunday FIL got really drunk and SIL and BIL2 got back home and found him on the floor conscious but really fucking drunk,no one was home and then they called me. I of course called BIL and asked if he wants to go with us ( he was in our city at a friend's place ) and he said no as MIL was with him.
We drive to the in-laws house go into the backyard and see MIL talking to and clearly drunk but now standing FIL and we ran past to BIL2 and SILs flat and talked. They don't know why FIL drank so much as they were not home for much of the week but overheard him saying "" We should just forget everything or talk about it to be a family again."" MIL responded "" not now maybe tomorrow when you're sober "" spoiler she didn't talk about it.

But today something interesting happened. She wrote SIL a message saying she is sorry for everything and that she will seek help.

I have a theory as to why she wrote it. When she was with BIL at his friends place ( she is friends with BILs friends mother ) they talked about the situation. A week prior I also talked to this friend as I'm also friends with her son's . I talked a little about the situation and she assured me that 'MIL always praised me and talked only good things about me ' ( before that I learned that she talked bad about me behind my back because I won't give her ' precious grandchildren ' and I deny SO the happiness of having children ) and I told her that she doesn't know the whole story and that I won't tell her as she has her own problems and is friends with MIL.

So said friend persuaded MIL to backtrack ( said friend studied psychology) and reflect on her behavior.


Now why am I here .
I don't know if I should approach MIL or wait until she approaches me to apologise and how I should handle a possible encounter or conversation.

Edited because I broke a rule and because grammar isn't my thing"
754," Since the last post got a lot of traffic, I wanted to clear up a few things. Me and DH live about 8ish hours away from his parents. MIL has had exactly 0 access to my birth control because I had an IUD for two years. I'm now on the pill and because MILs recent ""jokes"" have made me nervous, me and DH plan to safeguard them when we go to visit. I've been lurking in this group for some time; please trust that I completely understand the seriousness of locking up my birth control. It'd be great if everyone can tone down some of the panicky, ""LOCK UP YOUR BIRTH CONTROL"" messages. Me and DH have that under control. 

So, I had made a rough draft of what I wanted to say to MIL. My friend at work took a look at it and told me I wasn't being aggressive enough (true). She made an edited version for me and I could see how I was still trying to take care of MILs feelings over my own.  DH and I tweaked her edited version a bit to better fit us, and decided that that is what we would send. 

Here is the text we sent on Wednesday evening: 

""Hi mom, me and (Gonna-Throw-It) wanted to talk with you about our phone call the other night, specifically about the topic of grandkids. While we understand your excitement, we do not want children at this point and would like you to stop  pressuring us about this topic. We understand that you may not have any ill intentions behind these comments but they are becoming increasingly uncomfortable for us. Especially when you said that you would pray for a pregnancy and that ""god's will"" would make it happen when we've firmly established that  *that is not what we want*. We hope you can understand and respect our decision. We know that you and dad would be wonderful, loving, and caring grandparents, if the time comes, and we would be happy to have the both of you as a support system, but pressuring us about kids is no longer a topic of discussion or humor.""

I was super anxious sending it but me and DH spent the rest of the night decorating the house with Halloween stuff. We anticipated that she would immediately call us to discuss the message/her comments but we got nothing. 

And now it's Thursday evening and we still haven't heard from her. 

We're not sure what to expect. Me and DH believe she's either 1.processing or 2.is super upset. 

How long should we give her before we text her again asking that she confirms to us that she understands our message?"
755,"So my ILs are visiting this weekend. We haven't seen them in a few months. And I've been getting all worked up and stressed about the visit.

I don't have much post history on this account but there is a lot of pushy overstepping boundary stomping moment stealing history. 

Anyways so we try to make things better by taking more control of visits. No overnight guests so they get a hotel, only weekend trips, visits around naps instead of at my house all day long. And I'm thinking things will be okay.

Well last night my mil texts my DH asking if she can come with us to pick up the kids from daycare today with us, because i guess they will be getting in on time. Usually dh and I go together. She had asked in the past and we had always said no. Then one visit they were here for an emergency and they did do pickups for us. Now I guess she thinks that means she has liberty to come?

Even my DH was annoyed because it's just like a visit isn't enough, she always wants *more*. And we have no idea what she gains from it. My oldest is 2 and isn't going to be like OMG GRANDMA'S HERE. 

Anyways after we thought on it DH responded how she could if she really wanted to but that it would make pickup more difficult and we'd prefer they just meet us at the house. 

Reason for responding like this is because we truly feel if we flat out say no it'll cause tension for the whole weekend from the getgo. Like my mil will be all hurt and my fil will be up in arms we denied such a ""simple"" request. So we went with that, and then my DH says to me, well watch she wants to come anyways.

It's just annoying and unfair because it puts us in an awkward spot. They are already on their way to visit, she makes this request that any normal person would be like ok no problem but from them is a problem if we say no, now we are both annoyed going into the visit.

If my dad visited and asked the same thing I would easily say right away, no that makes pickup harder for us and he'd say oh ok no problem. But then I feel like it's such a small thing and I'm overreacting, but with her it always has to be something. It took us half a day to think of a response and respond because we both think it'll start something and have to be careful how to respond. It's ridiculous.

 She also has made like 12 comments how she needs to have a cupcake with my son to celebrate her birthday that just passed. And I thought ok annoying because in my opinion se's trying to recreate a moment between DH and lo that I posted a pic on Facebook, but I was like whatever we will do it and even bought the cupcakes. 

Now this too and it seems so small so I don't know if this is just major BEC or them being pushy from the start. Regardless this doesn't bode well for the weekend."
756,"I think I'm going to do a few story-time posts because bitching about my MIL and finding some solidarity has been vaguely therapeutic. I also have a very large arsenal of MIL stories and there's no better place to share them than among those who have to deal with my MIL's devil spawn sisters.

So, this is the time my MIL showed her ass at my baby shower:

I begrudgingly invited my MIL, her enabling mother, and bitchy daughter to my baby shower. I truthfully didn't want to, but I had already declined the gender reveal party they damn near demanded throwing-- which was said to only include THEIR family---no family or friends of the child bearer were considered. And also the baby shower they wanted to throw for me-- which was also said to only include, you guessed it: THEIR family. My excuse for the baby shower was I only wanted the one so I was shit outta luck there and had to invite them or I would of found myself forced to attend a baby shower planned and attended by my 3 least favorite people on the planet plus DH.

The bullshittery of this whole story started months before the shower itself. It all began with the registry.

I was due in May. We announced our pregnancy in September. MIL started in about what we wanted for the baby for Christmas at the end of September. DH's family always goes balls to the wall for Christmas. Are they rich? Not at all. Are they racking up credit cards to try and compensate for being shitty people all year? Probably. Anyways, *balls to the wall* Christmases. And they do it just for the sake of being ridiculous. Say MIL is going to get me a $100 gift card- she will buy 10 $10 gift cards so there's ""more to open"". So after Christmas we generally come home to our tiny house (literal tiny house) with a METRIC FUCK-TON of cheap shit that generally does nothing more than stress us out.

So, the hassling about what we need for the baby begins. The pregnancy was a surprise to us. My anxiety kept telling me everything that could possibly go wrong, so I kindly asked if I could wait and start picking things out until I was further into the second trimester. *No.* Texts every 3-4 days that she *needs* to know what to get. I give in and build a registry on Amazon of small items that I could tuck away in our spare closet. As soon as MIL sees the registry I'm greeted with a long list of everything I ""forgot"". I explain I didn't forget, yada yada yada...long story short, MIL gets us a ton of baby crap for Christmas from [Wish.com](https://Wish.com) that we didn't ask for. Stuff we were never going to ask for. For example....a fucking toddler urinal. I feel like such a bitch complaining about gifts, but we live in a 800 square foot house with no garage...things get cramped quick.

So, then the actual baby shower planning commences. First thing to know, my DH's family was butt-hurt that they were going to be guests at my baby shower and not throwing it. So EVERYTHING was critiqued. Shower was set to be in late February- they started voicing ""concerns"" around New Year's that they hadn't received their invites yet. MIL started verbally ""claiming"" gifts that she wanted reserved for herself. Not to mention all the electronic shit she had already bought from wish.com that literally did not work that I now could not register for because that would just give my MIL the ammunition she wanted to paint me as an ungrateful bitch of a DIL that she so loves to portray me as. ""Nothing I ever do for her is good enough"" type bullshit.

MIL starts harassing my mom on Facebook messenger- telling her all the things she has bought, plans to buy, and wanting to know what my mom has bought/spent. MIL wants to make sure she ""isn't doing too much or stealing anyone elses shine with her gift buying"" (her words)- everything is a competition with this woman. My mom, being the drama-free, God fearing, southern belle of a woman she is decides during all this that Facebook isn't important and deletes her page to hide from my MIL's harassment.

Through the next few months I am constantly receiving texts about things I will ""need"", ""things I have forgotten"", being told to ""trust her, I'm *just* a first time mom"" and ""she's raised two"". When in reality, I did my research- I had a very thorough registry and knew what I wanted. I knew I didn't need a bassinet, a rock and play, a pack and play, a crib and a million things that essentially do the same thing. Ya feel?

At around this time my DH (at the time BF) started preaching to his fam to please follow the registry for big ticket items. Like, we wanted the carseat/stroller we researched and picked out not some shit from wish. And he saw the stress I was feeling about the amount of large items that could possibly be entering our hobbit home in a few weeks time. He followed suit of his counselor and tells my MIL and her flying monkeys that we will return big items that we didn't register for/ don't have room for. He gets mocked about ""preaching the registry""--whatever, I assume it is handled.

Leading up to the baby shower I am treated like I am crazy by DH's family that DH is just going to casually stop in towards the end of the shower. His mother said ""*wow, you are making the day all about you, huh?""-* but she laughed so she could say it was just a joke (I feel the need to say DH also didn't want to have to be in attendance). Multiple family members of mine went ahead and gave me the gifts before the shower because MIL's aggressive gift behavior irked them to that point.

**Baby shower day finally arrived.** I will try to get to the point, because damn this bitch session is getting long.

I had friends from all different walks of life attending- and I knew many of them would be attending solo. I tried to stand by the door to hug and make everyone feel welcome while also trying to introduce my solo guests to other solo guests. But that quickly flopped because MIL and her flying monkeys *demanded* my undivided attention while people were filing in. They wanted constant pictures with me, had constant questions of who people were, kept calling me over to ask questions about the ""interesting food"". (My sister made a beautiful breakfast spread and MIL/flying monkeys acted incredibly condescending about it).

Everyone has finally arrived. Everyone is seated to play baby jeopardy while munching on food. I'm sitting at a table with some of my best friends and finally feel relaxed. Time passes and it's time to open gifts. I have secretly *dreaded*this moment- everyone staring at me while I open gifts/ try to react naturally. Just causes someone like me anxiety!

I begin with opening a gift from my kindergarten teacher. Yes guys, my fucking kindergarten teacher came. This woman was so special to me and my family and has always said she better get wedding/ baby shower invites. My heart burst when she showed up. But I open my gift from her- the diaper genie I registered for. As I am saying ""thank you so much"" my MIL says TO THE ROOM ""I hated my diaper genie. Never used the thing after I took it out of the box."" BITCHHHHHH. I am so flustered and embarrassed I pretend like I didn't hear her and then explain to everyone that this amazing woman was my freaking kindergarten teacher- which the sweetness of that seems to override my MIL's rude comment for the moment.

It continues, I open gifts with the occasional humiliating commentary by my MIL of what is wrong with the gift I just opened.

As my aunt starts hauling a large bag over to me MIL yells ""not yet! save all those bags until last!"" (this is a fucking ritual of hers. Anytime she buys a gift it has to be the 'grand finale').

I finally make it to the end: the 3 giant bags. They look like trash bags with patterns on them and as my aunt carries the first one over it's loud- like a bag of dishes. My friend's 3 year old daughter who was helping me open gifts starts to tear open the bag and is quickly fussed at by MIL- ""she has to read the card first! open the card!""

My pregnant ass was so over everything by this point. I open the card which actually turned out to be a bunch of assembly instructions thrown together in an envelope.

MIL then explains that ""UPS was awful and ruined ALL the boxes of the things she had ordered! so she had to throw them in these trash bags and in the envelope was the assembly instructions for all 3.""

In my hand I held assembly instructions for a pack and play, a bouncy seat, and a bouncer- all which I had not registered for, but was now stuck with because my crazy ass narcissistic MIL unboxed them all so we could not return them!

At some point in all this madness DH had arrived and MIL made a power move by pulling him up a chair with her. MIL also asked my mother where her gifts where! To which I responded ""Oh, she's basically bought the entire nursery."" Which was true, my mother bought almost every piece of furniture in there save the crib and bookcase my father made for LO (MIL made sure to let us know a crib wasn't important to have when everyone was talking about the beautiful handmade wooden crib from my dad). I didn't get pictures with more than half of my guests because MIL and family took so many. A friend of mine was taking polaroids but then MIL and flying monkeys all wanted pics on their phones and demanded different angles and to see the pics before moving. During this time people just started leaving. I didn't get a pic with my own mother I was so preoccupied with their bullshit.

So, yes. That is how my MIL behaved herself at my baby shower. And yes, 4 different friends text me later curious who the heck the large woman with the short hair was.

\*We found use for the unregistered gifts from MIL. We already had a crib, bassinet, swing, etc that was bought off the registry so we just furnished my mothers house with the large baby items from MIL. \*

\*\* Edit 1 \*\*

I should of mentioned the [wish.com](https://wish.com/) items I refer to were things such as baby monitor, sound machine, humidifier, thermometer, etc. These things were either missing pieces/ simply did not work so I tossed them. Haven't tried the baby monitor yet.

And the large items that are at my mom &amp; dad's house were actually by reputable brands. My mom watches LO enough for us that she needed some items anyways"
757,"Feel free to read my other posts to get an idea of my JNMIL. There is just so much to say. But what it comes down to for this question in particular is that she lives about 8 hours away and has met DS, who is 6 months old, a total of 3 times. He's the first grandchild on both sides. She's not a big part of his life and never will be, just like she's not a big part of her kids' life, because she always makes her own needs a priority. She lives 8 hours away from her kids and grandkid because she moved to be closer to her boyfriend (a total jerk who all of her kids hate and who cheated on her when they last dated 10 years ago). But of course with social media, people can make their families appear perfect based on what they post, so she of course posts all these happy things about her kids and now DS so that people think (and so that SHE thinks) she's this wonderful, involved mother. So I used to send pictures more often of DS in a big group with DH's whole family, including his grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. And it was a nice way to share pictures of him. But not 5 minutes later, I would go on facebook and theres MIL's new post, with my picture, ""My precious little man!!"", ""My best guy!"". She's obsessed with facebook. Obsessed. And she has over a thousand friends because she friend requests every one and their mother. So photos of DS get hundreds of likes and shares (some of which I can't even see, because sometimes a person who shares it has their privacy settings on ""friends only."")

I hate facebook. I have one because occasionally I will scroll through posts, but I hardly ever post things. I posted a picture when we got married a few years ago, a picture when I graduated college...but I rarely rarely post anything. But to each his own. I do use instagram. I've posted a handful of pictures of DS there. MIL does not have instagram but SIL and BIL do, sooo once I say something asking that she doesn't put DS on facebook, I'm worried she's going to say something about my instagram. It feels so silly writing this out, but how do I justify my new ""rule"" that I'm trying to set when I post my own things on a different form of social media? For those who have set this rule with in laws or family members, do you just ask that they don't post YOUR pictures? Or any pictures they have taken of your kids also?

&amp;#x200B;

Just as an FYI, DH hates facebook too, hasn't posted more than a wedding picture in the last 10 years. And he doesn't have any other form of social media. 

I'm thinking of deleting my facebook altogether just to make a point."
758,"*update* I've been seeing a lot of comments I'd like to address 
- MIL does not have any mental instabilities
- MIL is generally a caring and nurturing person which is why this stood out to me as so shocking
- I did not notice the diaper as we were at their house. It was midnight, we were going home from a wedding and wanted to get home. DH picked her up from the bed and put her in the car seat. I didn't realize the diaper until I got her out of the car seat when we got home (20 minute drive)
- obviously I'm going to talk to her about this, I was hoping for some constructive advice as I am very timid and non-confrontational
- thankfully, she did not suffer a diaper rash or anything worse. She was wearing Pampers cruisers 360, the ones that look like pull ups
- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOU COMMENTS AND CONCERN ❤️


Since my daughter was born, my parents have usually been the grandparents that watched her if the husband and I needed a sitter. My daughter loves my parents and could spend every day there if she could. Recently, my husband and I were invited to a ""no kids allowed"" wedding which my parents were attending as well. We figured this would be a good opportunity for my husband's parents to watch her for an extended period of time. We dropped her off at noon and picked her up at midnight. When we got home, I noticed she was in the same style diaper that I dropped her off in. It was the last of that package so I had packed new, different diapers. She smelled horrible. I looked in her diaper bag and all 6 diapers I had packed were still there. I came to the horrific realization that it was indeed the same diaper she was wearing at drop off time. I was absolutely livid. How can a person (a grandma?!) not tell when she needs to change a diaper? How do I tell my MIL that she still needs to take care of diapering? I feel like that is one routine (other than feeding) that is fairly obvious that needs to be done. We even went over her food, diapers, playtime and bedtime routine before we left.  She thinks she's the best mom in the world and can't wait for her 12 grandkids....even though she has two sons and only one has given her a single grandchildren (us). I just feel so bad for my little girl. This is, unfortunately, just a tiny tiny piece of the pie with my MIL but this one was a pretty serious offense in my mind."
759,"This may not belong here as it's not as much about FMIL but I just wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice on the few posts I've made. This is a wonderful community and I wish I had heard about it sooner.
I just wanted to give a final update. I talked with my SO just a few hours ago about the situation of FMIL and what we thought we should do...and it ended with our going our separate ways. It was a very hard decision for me to make and I know she's hurting bad because I'm doing no better, I'm nothing but tears and grief and pain right now, but I just wanted to thank everyone for being so supportive and helpful. 
I wish I could have brought a success story, but this was probably the only way it was going to end."
760,"I recently left my abusive husband and am currently staying with my sister.   My husband's  mother has turned into somewhat of a flying monkey.  This evening, however, she has excelled at whatever game it is they are both playing.

She turned up at my sister's house.

Bold as brass she just knocked on the door and asked to speak with me.  My sister (amazing woman that she is) told her that I was no longer staying with her.  My MIL asked for my new address because she was worried I had had a mental breakdown as I wasn't acting like myself and she wanted to check in on me.  My sister told her that she wasn't going to tell her where I was, that the only person who would be checking to see if I was ok would be her, because she was my family and MIL wasn't anymore because I had left her son.  She then told her that if she came to her house again she would call the police.  Did I ever mention that I love my sister??

My MIL didn't raise her voice, she wasn't threatening in any way and she left when she was asked.  Technically she has done nothing wrong.  I honestly don't know what to do.  I think that I'm going to have to try and move sooner than anticipated because I don't want to drag my nieces into anything that might happen, but then again, nothing might happen.  It's a bit of a conundrum.

EDIT: Why can I not compose a title without typos?????"
761,"So... I figured there has been another attack from culty cow.

I questioned it because I could see DH was down. He said culty cow has accused him of being the cause of the falling out by repeating and misconstruing texts and phone calls she has made. I said she is shifting blame and gaslighting. I didn't need you to even repeat things that she said to you because everything she did was blatantly obvious (example: the fact that I had to get caller ID on my home phone so she couldn't harass me on the phone). And the fact that she'd call after visits to list her observations &amp; interfere (meaning complain about me, the kids, control, ban this ban that... ,I do have ears!)

Then hahaha she tells him in a text which he showed me, that he needs to get the kids together- MY KIDS to tell me I am wrong, tell the truth to me that she never did anything but love them. ROTF.  Like thinks the kids will go against me, and side with her.???? The kids are teens now (aside from one) and can verify how they dont like them (meaning his parents) and they are oppressive etc and don't want to see them.

She tries to bring up my 'mental illness ' and how His sister has nothing but concern for my mental health. ROTF. Yeh because you have told all your daughters that I made up all these graphic lies about you and made me out to be a nut to paint yourself innocent.

She needs to stop the effort of painting herself innocent and her daughters innocent. It's getting embarrassing. For one, her daughters have complained about the same behaviour from her either in front of me or to me (on the odd occasion I'd actually talk to them, I learned to watch them because they love info and gossip so I'd stay aloof).

1 SIL has called culty cow fruity. Told me she has the audacity to snatch cookies out of her kids hands and say that's not healthy (And in my experience, yes she will do this and then turn up with a bag of candy).

His other sister complained, every day cult cow is in her  face about the kids, nagging.  This particular sister was in and out of contact with culty cow for about 10 years, citing selfishness, bullying, manipulation- now she has decided to 'forgive ' and go back and insists I need to be  made to reconcile with culty cow (So despite all the texts and stories you sent &amp; told us for years, now contact suits you, so it has to suit me ??)

His other sister related a story where his Dad rang up and abused a pastor because culty cow trIed to go to a Bible study that the pastors wife was running- tried to get all the women listening to her and her stories &amp; beliefs and the Pastors wife said okay thanks for sharing let's start the Bible study now (take back control) so she went home &amp; complained that the women's group wouldn't listen to her so his Dad called the pastor and abused him And they stormed out of the church lol.

Oh and apparently the devil is lying to me she repeats 'She loves me' and the devil is trying to deceive me. ROTF. Desperate measures.

What the heck?"

Another piece of eye candy. For what it's worth, I was 30 something weeks pregnant with #3 and she had no idea, and my husband was out of town working a job for 5 months. We weren't split. All mistakes are hers. (BTW her surgery was Lasik and a tummy tuck).

*OP-*

*I've thought long and hard about this. Its time for you to get over whatever you think I have done to wrong you and move on with your life. A happy normal life includes your family and at this time you and your life are not normal. Normal happy healthy people do not cut off their mothers or their grandmothers. Normal happy healthy people do not make there brothers choose between there sister and neices or their own mother. Normal happy healthy people do not use their children as prawns in a game of getting their way.* 

*I'm getting older and I am not the healthiest. I had abomnial surgery not too long ago and eye surgery betewen then and now. You know as well as i do that (her sister) and (my cousin, her sister's daughter) were not speaking when (cousin) died because of Cousin's selfish choices. You donot want that to be us. Your making selfish choices right now because the devil has your heart and you are not thinking of your children, of your mother, of your grandmother, only of yourself. That is not Right. Think beyond yourself for once in your life.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bible tells you to ""honor thy father and thy mother"" and you're not honoring your mother. If you were you wouldn't be keeping my grandbabies away from me when I have done NOTHING TO YOU except be the best mother possible. I was a GREAT mother and still am. I have a list of people who can tell you that I was a great mother and whatever lies you have made up in your head are just LIES and untruths.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*You stolled talking to me for no reason what so ever. What kind of person keeps their mothers from their grandbabies? I do not know why you stopped talking to me. I've apologized for anything and everything I could have done but you refuse to accept that. You're overweight so your lies of me starving you are pretty obvious. You have friends now that were your friends then so your lies that i didn't let you do anything are ovbious too. What about the dance, the sleepovers, the proms, the cheerleading? you had so much fun doing pageants but then you refused to loose weight so i didn't see waisting our money to throw them away on something you'd never win because you refused to loose weight. You're a pretty girl but fat girls don't win pageants. It's the turth. the BIBLE says the turth will set you free.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*While we are being honest I will tell you that i am scared for your children. You can't look past an imaginary childhood you made up in your head to paint me as a vilian but you think your fit to raise small kids? what kind of people are they going to gorwn up as with you isoloating them from their riteful family members/ where is your husband, OP? Your on divorce number 2 at the ripe age of 26. I think it's pretty clear who the unsafe one is here and it is not me.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why are you so obssessed with money. Eveyr one reports to me that those kids never wear the same thing twice. THat you always have on the Inter Net that yaw are going and spending or taking frivilous vacations and buying new things you don't need. when I see your car in town it's at the store or in a fast food restraunt which if you would stop and grow up and start cooking you'd lose the weight you need to loose. Money doesn't grown on trees and what are you going to do when the money runs out? When you stop having a man to take care of you and who is afraid to tell you no. you always did hate the word no. I joked that i did not know how to relate to you that I'd tell you to get out of the house and walk and exercise and you'd rather read a book. What child does that besides one who is forcing themselves to to spite their mama? Kids don't enjoy that sort of thing. I never met one any way. But you were spiteful and venegevful from the beginning. Anything to make your mom have a headache. Now when I get people messaging me telling me that your in Burger King again or at that Japanese place or in walmart with a buggy load of friivilous name brands I have to realize its a game with you and you are doing this just to spite me. It's time to grow up OP. I'm telling you as your mother to grown the hell up and put your kids first, then your family, and start living a healthier life. Come back to me, OP. Me and grandma will be so happy to help you start over. We will help you get your husband back. We will help you make a budget and stick to it. Have you ever seen that tv show 'interveintions'? you need an interviention with food and money. And that's what we as your loving CARING FAMILY will do.*

After wards we will be going for dinner at the place of Grandm's choice as she is the oldest mother.

763,"It's me again! This time around my SO has written a little bit about his perspective. For some background see my first post, the tl;dr is that my MIL is explosive and a little bit over a month ago she blew up on me, the gist being that I am allegedly ignoring her and being rude. For me it was strike 3 and since then I try to find a way of dealing with the aftermath. My SO has begun to understand that a line has been crossed for me, so that's good. 


The situation at the moment is such that since the fallout I have not had contact with MIL and only spoken once with FIL. However, it is not uncommon for me to not see them for a month or two, so right now I think she has no idea how upset I still am about all that happened. My SO has been to her birthday and they speak on the phone regularly. They made plans that my SIL will be staying for a weekend at the end of October and I actually look forward to having her here. Usually my ILs drop her off, we spend the afternoon and evening together, have dinner, and then they leave. We then bring SIL back to their house the next day or they pick her up, and spend some more time all together.  


I expressed to my SO that I think he should go pick SIL up and drop her off the next day to avoid them being at our house. He is fine with that. BUT he wants me to come with him for pick up.

As the logistics of the weekend will probably be discussed beforehand via the phone, my SO dreads the call and having to explain that/why I don't want to come or have them at our house. 


Here we will split the story so that the reasoning and point of view of my SO and me are clear.


SO point of view:

my mother still expects to drop my sister off and i dont really know how to tell her that i wanna pick my sister up this time, but especially why. its a conversation that i rather not have especially over the phone.

i need to take my girlfriend and my familys feelings in to consideration to not escalate things further.


My point of view:

At this point I am not comfortable exposing myself to my MIL, I get anxious just thinking about it. I'm not saying that I wont ever visit them again, but for me it's too early. I'm afraid I will come across extra distant and cold, because right now I don't feel any warmth towards my ILs and I refuse to put on a show for their sake. Also, I don't want to participate in what I consider a major rugsweeping attempt. IF my SO and I bring up that we/I are very bothered by what happened and that she can not treat me like that a fight will break out, and I don't see why I should be around for that either. 


We would really appreciate advice on how to deal with the ILs and especially how to make sure that this whole thing does not start to take a toll on our relationship. Any insights, tips and experiences are helpful at this point. We both don't want to go scorched earth with them because of SIL. We want to be civil with MIL and OP wants to keep her integrity. Thank you!"
764,"I haven't posted in a while because things have actually been going well after the initial blowback from siblings-in-law over going NC with JNMIL over 3 months ago. I'm mostly just posting an anxious ramble/update over the impending holidays.

(For a recap: JNMIL had been spamming D(ear)H and I with anti-vaxx articles even after telling her multiple times to stop. Things came to a head when she mocked me in a family group text for wanting to once again not receive anti-vaxx stuff. DH confronted her privately via text and she said I deserved it. I wrote her a letter outlining how she has overstepped and hurt me and DH over the years, and when DH and I decide to have children, we will be requiring everyone to get vaccinated or not see them. I clearly wrote that we would only respond if she apologized genuinely. Her response was basically, ""Sorry, not sorry, and you'll never see my vaccine records."" So DH and I went NC. A month or so after that, we found out I'm pregnant.)

A few weeks after finding out I'm pregnant, I noticed that I wasn't friends with my 16 y/o SIL on Facebook anymore. I adore my little sisters in law, and keep in contact with them via email updates, and had been so happy that SIL had finally been allowed to get her own Facebook this year. So I emailed her, asking if I had done something to upset her. Her response: ""I'm not mad at you! Unfriending you was my mom's decision, you'll have to talk to her."" I was livid. I emailed back, ""This is your account, it should have been your decision. I'm sorry your mom is controlling your Facebook and involving you in something that has nothing to do with you."" She said, ""I just wish you two could get along."" 

When I was about 10 weeks along, DH's 3 oldest siblings visited us so we told them the news. DH has 2 little siblings still living at home, so as a group we video called them to tell them the news. FIL was in the room. He and DH still talk, but I can't bring myself to talk to that man. It weirds me out that he acts like nothing has happened, even though I sent him the letter as well and even called him out for being sexist to me. Anyway, FIL kept pressing about the due date. I signaled to DH that I didn't want to give out details, so DH just said, ""Spring of next year. Due dates aren't exact, etc etc."" JNSIL (who is a year older than me) wasn't getting how uncomfortable I was and offered to show FIL the ultrasound pictures. I couldn't remember if the due date has been put on the pictures so I whispered to JNSIL that I wasn't comfortable with that. She gave me a look and said, ""Oh, come on."" Trying to push away my hatred of confrontation, I surprised myself by responding firmly, ""It's my choice."" She rolled her eyes and took the pictures over to the video call. I was hurt and shocked. Afterwards, I made it clear to DH that I don't want to share anymore details with JNSIL. 

After that call, I had expected some kind of contact from JNMIL over the news that her baby rabies dreams were coming true. She was so angry in her past email to DH, saying, ""How dare you threaten to keep grandchildren from me."" (Meaning, ""I'm not getting vaccinated for your kids and you better let me see them anyway!"") But to my surprise, she never reached out.

At 12 weeks, I sent out announcement cards. I got calls and messages and emails of congratulations and how cute the cards were. Still nothing from JNMIL. 

When I initially went NC, I was extremely sad and depressed because I did love my MIL before the anti-vaxx stuff. But now, after 3 months, I just feel pity for her. Pity that she's too stubborn over feeling right that she'll throw away a relationship with her first grandchild. That she forced her 16 y/o to unfriend me on Facebook. It's just sad.

Anyway, I'm mostly posting this because JNMIL's birthday is coming up this weekend. Ever since we got married, I've been in charge of buying the gifts for both my family and DH's family. Gift-giving is part of my love language, and I told DH that I would not be spending any time or energy on JNMIL's gifts anymore. I told him that he could send a gift or a card if he wanted, but he hasn't. 

Since she's been so stubborn with not reaching out, I (and my therapist) suspect she'll continue it through until Christmas. So this post will mostly just serve as a reminder to me about her pettiness. 

I plan on sending out an email in November, reminding family members to get their flu shots if they want to see me over the holidays. Who knows if that'll actually be the thing to set her off."
765,"Hey folks, I have a MIL who's overbearing, gossipy, and feels like she needs to parent my husband and I (she always says I'm like a daughter to her which apparently gives her permission to do shit like call my gynecologist's office).

So after I had my baby a little over a year ago and had a traumatic birth followed by a PTSD struggle, I stopped talking to her. Hubs handles his people, I handle mine. I knew she occasionally talked to my elderly dad, but didn't worry about (even though it's fucking weird right?) Because between DH and I, we don't share anything substantial abour our lives anyhow.

Well I was talking to my mom and arranging our post-Christmas get together (we live opposite sides of the country from both sets of parents), she says that JNMIL asked MY PARENTS if she could visit MY HOUSE when they visit. Like is she trying to arrange a fucking playdate between my DH and I? I don't get it.

Either way, DH and I are pissed, and she's gonna hear about it whenever DH decides to make one of his infrequent calls to her.

Ugh. I'm getting anxious anticipating the next visit."
766,"Sigh, so we got our wedding photos back on Monday, and spent a good few hours going through them and giggling at our dumb antics.

I noticed that MIL is all smiles in photos with her family, and mostly sour faced when I'm in the photo. Weird, point it out to DH, who shrugs it off. 

I then get suspicious and pull out the video and photos from our elopement, and find all the photos that MIL are in. Not a single smile. Does not matter who else is there, or what we are doing, she clearly was nonplussed about the whole event.

Point this out to DH, and he presumes that I'm just looking for a fight. I'm not, but cool. I remind him that we had this dumb wedding because she bitched and complained (okay, not the only reason, but she was the loudest), so the least she could do was look happy.

He storms off and doesn't want to hear about it. I clearly just hate his mom and am looking for any excuse to complain about her...Cool."
767,"Hi 

Please see my previous posts for further info, I’m not sure how to link all that. 

Sooooo I was over visiting so on Thursday and around school time son phoned up wanting to know about school trip. I think ex  was in background on phone also. Fair enough kid phones all the time I know he needs stuff etc etc

30 seconds or so passes and phone rings again. Apparently they’d also phoned granny and informed her of school trip granny suspicious they’re up to something or other. 

Now all this is well and good except I don’t know where I’m at here or what I’m supposed to be. I felt quite angry as so had been telling me he hadn’t been bothering with his mother much not seen her much she had been a bit overbearing with him. But apparently that’s not strictly true now is it? Since mummy phoned him about kids school trip. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m angry. I feel like I’m somehow getting played or something.im always out of the loop somehow while they’re all tight knit like a team all the time. Why am I angry? 

Why is he doing this? Saying he’s not having much to do with his mother but clearly it’s fine? So it’s me then?  I know I can’t change them.  This is the first time I’ve dated anyone with a kid. I like kid but was totally not expecting the ex and mother in law crap at all 

I feel really on edge with anxiety anyway and skin stuff that’s bothering me and all this stupid crap isn’t really helping any of that. Haven’t really got anyone to talk to about any of this crap, so I feel alone. I’d talk to him but I don’t know what to say without sounding like I’m the unreasonable one? Why can’t we be a team? I just keep feeling like I don’t fit in? Like they’re a team even the ex. Am I over reacting? I don’t even know why I’m angry and with anxiety I’m never sure of my own judgement. 

Any help , thoughts, advice , similar situations please chime in. It’s much appreciated I’m glad this place exists 🙂"
768,"If you look in my post history you’ll find the story behind this...

FIL stood up to JNMIL! Older SIL (who has been in our corner all along but was trying to keep peace with suggestions) just texted DF and I “I’m so glad to hear dad put his foot down with ballet!” 
“Wait what?!” DF and I are both missing details... FIL told DF yesterday that he’d “rather (younger SIL) miss the whole show than miss (DF and I)’s wedding” and I guess older SIL knows some things we don’t know that FIL said to JNMIL and younger SIL. Hooray!

FIL DEFINITELY earned some brownie points"
769,"[Previous thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dfolej/mil_addicted_to_runescape_drops_her_kids_to_go_to)

After speaking to MILs friend, we found out MIL actually didn't just drop the kids at her door, it seems much worse than that.

A few weeks ago when MIL told us she wanted to 'go away for a few days by herself' she mentioned that her boyfriend will look after the kids for her while she's away.

We found out MIL disappeared when MILs friend called us one morning, frantically asking if the kids were in school, so we called the school and found out that they hadn't turned up.

Turns out one of the kids texted MILs friend the night before saying can't wait to stay with you etc, but she didn't read it until the morning. First time she's heard anything about this, and MIL wasn't at the house or answering the phone (she never does) so ofcourse, MILs friend was in a panic.

We told her MILs boyfriend was suppose to have them, but after a quick call, he told us MILS FRIEND was suppose to have them. 

After knocking on some suspected doors for an hour she managed to finally trace them to their fathers. The kids were wearing the same school outfit all week, slept in them and had no pyjamas or spare clothing or toiletries. This was a Thursday, their mother wasn't coming back till Tuesday.

Their father is just as bad, floor is full of alcohol stains, tobacco and mould. He has no bed for the kids to sleep in and no oven to cook food with. MILs friend decided to take them off him and look after them herself, even went out to buy them new clothes.

Its somehow worse that MIL told people different stories. She doesn't care if she doesn't know where her children are.

What I reckon happened was, MIL slept in for her trip, threw the kids in the car with no bags packed, dropped the kids off at the nearest possible person (their dad's) and fucked off without updating anyone.


They were suppose to go to school that day but the school weren't informed about that either, so it counts as an unauthorised absence (they already have 40% attendance this year)

Added bonus:

Over the last few months both CPS and the School would ask us if we had MILs new number as they could never contact her. We didn't have it, MIL mentioned she got a new number but never gave it to us either. Last time I picked the kids up from school, their phone suddenly rang. It was the school, thinking it was their mum. She gave them her old phone with old number, without informing anyone about her new number. Whaaat?

She hasn't had a working house phone in two years and removed herself from social media.."
770,"I haven’t posted anything in a while but I’m the poor soul whose MIL had a hip surgery and somehow couldn’t put her own bra on until her son moved out of her house. Botinlaw will probably explain it better. It’s been one hell of a year. Her hip surgery went well and while her dogs were a holy terror for 6 weeks they eventually went home. For less than 6 weeks. 

Less than 6 weeks later, her house flooded so her and her dogs are staying here. It was originally supposed to be 4-6 months until her house was fixed. It has now been 5 months with no end in sight. Plus, she plans on staying throughout winter so she doesn’t have to drive far to work. She never really asked just said that she thought it was a good idea and probably what she would do. 

I am going nuts. My husband spends almost all his time awake with her if she’s home. He’ll just sit with her for hours not talking but he won’t do anything else because he feels like he has to be with his poor lonely mom. I’m constantly getting ignored because she’s playing this poor pity me act and he doesn’t feel right leaving her to entertain herself. We paid to put cable in her room because she said she’d go in there and watch TV so we could have alone time but yet that TV is never on. 

She constantly buys snack food even though we’ve both explicitly told her to not buy snack food. We don’t buy snack food because our impulse control sucks and we’ll eat it all in a day if it’s in the house. She still does though. This week it was chips, last week it was ding dongs, week before that it was special Halloween sno balls. DH was doing really well at eating better and getting some light cardio in but she managed to convince him that it was okay to skip a day and then skip the next day because it’s like a weekend. She keeps wearing him down until the habit is broke so he’d have to start all the way from the bottom.  She’s also insistent on eating out almost every night. I’ll be thawing stuff for supper and instead she’ll convince DH that fast food would be better. If I actually manage to cook something before she gets home, she usually thumbs her nose up at it and won’t eat it. I know for a fact that SIL did not have to put up with this nonsense when MIL stayed at her house after her surgery. 

She constantly interrupts me and never lets me talk. She always tries to one up somebody whenever they try to say something. She’s constantly shitting on DHs and my generation about how lazy and easily offended we are and how we don’t know what we’re doing. She talks about how lazy we are but both of her sons have had to pay her mortgage for periods of time because she didn’t want to get an extra job. It doesn’t help that we have polar opposite political views that she just will not shut up about at all hours of the day. She’s also gotten extremely racist and sexist and makes sure that everyone knows what she thinks. 

She also is like addicted to outrage news, stuff like child and animal abuse. Every story she sees on Facebook about some disgusting act she has to read it aloud and comment about how she hates seeing stuff like that but we’ve offered several times to show her how to filter that out but she won’t. 

My health has started to be effected since she moved in. I’m on an extra blood pressure pill to control the stress migraines I was getting, she smokes in the house which gives me headaches and nausea and even with the other migraine medicine I was prescribed, I still get migraines almost every day. There have been like periods of weeks where I couldn’t be in my own home because I would get migraines just thinking about being in the same room as her￼. DH says that she’s lonely and that she needs him so that’s why he spends so much time with her and I get it but she’s also a grown woman that can make her own friends. 

I’ve got 5 more months of this and I’m not sure if I can do it.

EDIT: Thank you all for the helpful advice. To answer a few general questions: yes, I am sure that the repairs aren’t being done; she will be giving us the money for living expenses when it comes in so she’s not committing insurance fraud, she gets all her mail forwarded and insurance checks sent directly here so she’s not hoarding any money and there aren’t any other places she can stay while her house is getting fixed. 

I did have a talk with my husband and we are going to talk to her together about leaving sooner than she plans, keeping the smoking outside, buying junk food/wanting to eat out and spending more time in her room so we can have more alone time. We also talked about her spending more time with him out of the house so that I can relax for a bit. We talked more about how I feel in all this mess and he agreed that he’s been neglectful towards my emotions and how it’s effected my health. Every time we’ve talked about something he has made and kept progress, maybe not as much as I like but if we talk about it again he makes more progress."
771,"DH went to his first counceling session today and talked about my JNMIL and JNFIL. 
Now. DH has always been quiet but as a child he was not, my memory of his was loud, wild, and hilarious. He hated me and I of course made a promise to marry him one day. 😆
Anyway. He was working through some of his emotionlessness towards the drama with his family and my own and he came to see how he treats all confrontation like that (disassociate, no emotions). He worked through it more and he remembered a bunch of things that have caused him to be this way. His mom was an abusive alcoholic who apparently hurt JNFIL alot (he said she pushed him down the stairs) and would leave DH to his own devices, one time dh rolled a 4 wheeler (child size and he was only 10) and because his mom was no where to be found, he was stuck like that for God knows how long till he wiggled out. 
He told me so much of his memories as a child were him crying and scared that JNMIL was drunk driving and one time when he was being bad in a store she pulled his pants and underwear down to spank him, although she claims the underwear part was an accident. 

DH is realizing how in the fog he was and how he feels so much less pressure and stress now that we are NC. 

Thanksgiving is coming this weekend so we are anticipating some drama from both sides but we are now ready for it more than ever. 

It feels so good for him to see JNMIL for who she really is and he is in even more agreement that she will never be alone with DD if we ever regain contact, which he has no interest in for now. 

I guess it's a success too, but I'm so proud of him and the work he's doing."
772,"Saw the pediatrician end of September. Not my MILs business so I didn’t tell her or anyone right away.  BUT my pediatrician said that nobody should be near baby girl till they have at the very least the flu shot. That we shouldn’t even bring her places where I cannot day everyone’s gotten it (for thanksgiving due to the flu having higher levels in the world or whatever). 

Now idk about any of y’all but I take my baby’s health seriously. I have a horrible immune system and get sick often and I’m hoping I didn’t pass that on to her but currently she’s still too young and anything could hurt her. So if the pediatrician says don’t bring her near unvaccinated people, she ain’t going near them. Unfortunately SO wasn’t at this appointment so he didn’t hear the pediatrician say it but when we go back this month I’ll see if that’s the same. 

Few days ago we went to a winery for a festival. Brought baby against my wishes for the sake of SOs family getting to see her (they were there too) despite it being really fucking cold. 

I casually mention what the pediatrician said. Instantly my MIL says she and the whole family won’t be getting the flu shot because “why put all those chemicals into your body. It only fights last years strain not the newer one. If I’m not sick I’m not getting it.” And my personal favorite “WE DONT GET SICK EVER SHELL BE FINE.” 

Excuse me bitch what? Idfc if nobody has been sick in years. Get the fucking shot like the want to protect your grandkid should outweigh your need to be a psycho. Like what?

And now my SO is sincerely questioning if I’m being crazy about it. But like the flu can put babies in the hospital or worse. I won’t risk her health for his mothers fucked up ego thinking she doesn’t need a shot because bitch I don’t need to be at your house for thanksgiving and neither does my kid

He doesn’t get and wants to believe that I’m wrong. Well if the dr (we’re seeing a different pediatrician the next time we go) says that a shot isn’t required but to still be wary then fine. Shots not required but no kissing. No face touching. I will be helicopter Mom because my MIL is legit the kinda woman who thinks she’s right no matter what and will do what she wants because she’s graaaaandmaaaaaaa. 

Fuck with my kids health and I swear to god I will beat you with one of the shitty bottles of wine you keep in your house woman. 

I don’t know how to handle this. I never thought I would actually encounter an antivaxxer in real life and now my MIL shows herself to be one. How does someone combat this kind of thing? How does one get their idiot partner to see that their mother is a psycho who needs to get a simple shot in order to keep our child safe? I need help"
773,"Recap: I'm in my late 20s and my JNMOM (Artsy) has near complete control of my life. She's emotionally and verbally abusive and I'm virtually a prisoner in my own home. I'm currently seeing a therapist in secret and plan on escaping by January.

I got a bonus at work! It's not a lot but it's money Artsy doesn't know about and can't touch. I basically took on a project that was falling apart because some of the people involved unexpectedly left for a variety of reasons. It involves some design work but most of it is coordinating and scheduling people. Two things I excel at.

Some more good news: One of my uncles and his wife are going on a trip and they're leaving their kids with us. All of the kids are preteens/teens so we don't actually have to do much. The best part is that Artsy is obsessed with people especially children liking her so she can't go full crazy on me while they're staying with us. The next two weeks are going to be heavenly.

Looking forward to more money in my pocket and some peace and quiet."
774,"My boyfriends mom is the nicest person I have ever met, but it’s beginning to worry me how close her and my boyfriend are. He is 26 and we have been dating for almost three years. We just went to Europe for three weeks and after three days she was crying through FaceTime because she missed him. When we came back she kept saying that I took her away from him in a joking way but it’s beginning to not be such a joke. She was pushing me away from him as we went our separate ways after the airport, saying I’d seen him enough. Usually when he stays with me she will message him in the morning and at night every day and will call in the afternoon to see what he is doing. If he doesn’t answer she worries and continues to call and will even call me. I can’t say anything to my boyfriend because she walks on water but I want him to establish boundaries. 
Once we were arguing and he stopped to answer his mom and I told him to stop being such a mommas boy. I was upset and it was a rude way to say it but it bothered me. The next day he told me that there is nothing wrong with him talking to his mom so I have not brought it back up as I don’t know how or if I even should yet. I know this will only get worse especially because I’d like to move cities and can only imagine the comments she would make towards me for taking her “baby” away. 
She is very domestic, cleans all his clothes, makes his food, treats the husband the same way and the other brother so she is idolized by them. Also a very submissive personality."
775,"I just ran into a neighbour who I see every few months. She told me my MIL had accosted her at the shop where she works to ask if she'd seen my H recently. My neighbour said she's said hi to him occasionally and then MIL starts with ""Well, you know he's disowned me and I'm banned from his house..."" and tries to get my neighbour to listen to her sob story (that she's made up entirely in her own mind, they disowned H, see previous posts). 

I told my neighbour I was so sorry and she said not to worry at all, she had a similar MIL and so had just given MIL short answers, no sympathy and ended the conversation as fast as she could, bearing in mind she was at work!

I had a nice chat with her and swapped a few stories, her MIL was definitely cut from the same cloth as mine, lol. 

Anyway, I'm just in disbelief that MIL is trying to involve people she barely knows in this, trying to make us look bad, or what? My neighbour and I were both at a loss as to what she was trying to achieve.

MIL and FIL had also confronted this neighbour at work  a few years ago, shortly after we'd moved in, telling them to change a light on their property that IL's had decided was affecting us (it wasn't at all, they'd made this up from a conversation H had with them about something wrong with our property). We had apologised at the time but today my neighbour told me how odd she'd thought it was at the time because as well as this imaginary problem MIL had informed them there was a tree on their property (as if they didn't know) and insisted that they must cut it down for no reason.  Bear in mind our properties are not adjacent in any way, so even though they had made up some reason for the light needing to be changed there was no reason on earth to be talking about their tree. So yeah, at least she'd already given off her weird vibes and my neighbour knew not to get involved."
776,"So for those of you who saw my last posts about FMIL ( I’m going to start calling her feral beast instead), you will recall how she tried to attack me while I was 6 months pregnant 2 weeks ago and the only reason she didn’t was because my SO stopped her. He had to physically block the woman... or shall I say mongrel. Anyways this is like a mixture of an update and new story unfolding with said beast.

I haven’t spoken to her since the incident went down. No contact, not seeing her, nothing. She still rips on SO everyday and fight with him. You know telling him the typical “this is all your fault” or other things. There is still no food in their house. Anyways as you will recall (or read in my post history) from my last update, not even 24 hours after the attack attempt she sent a text trying to smooth things over and acted like nothing happened. I told her I would have to talk to my therapist before I even know where to begin with what to say to her. Since this, she has said her “dignity” is more important to her than meeting her unborn grandson when my SO told her if she couldn’t act like an adult that she would not come near our son when he is born. Well here’s the current tea....

First off, I ended up speaking to my therapist who was very helpful. However both she and my bf’s therapist said probably not to block her from the baby shower, but to make it clear she is a guest and it’s a day to celebrate the BABY (it’s only 4 hours ..... but I won’t have bf there to buffer so who knows). I’m still not currently talking to FMIL tho. I just switched jobs (I’m a full time student so I work part time and wanted to work somewhere closer to home). My new job pays way better and is 5 mins away rather than 30. They told me at hire that the reason they hired me right away is because I can work fridays-Sunday’s. So I’m starting said job next weekend. I already had to request a day off as my bf’s dad’s girlfriend is having a birthday party for her daughter and invited me and my bf. I love that woman, she is the opposite of FMIL and so sweet and kind.  Bf RSVPs yes for us and then that’s when FMIL hatches a what I can only imagine devious plot.

My bf informs me td that she has invited us to go upstate with her for a whole weekend in 2 weeks. Not just any weekend tho, we would leave the day the dad’s gf is having a birthday party for her daughter. Not only that but it would be the second week I’ve been working and I know my bf has told FMIL that I was hired to mainly work weekends, and we were going to the bday party that day. I told him that even if I wanted to go, which I really don’t, I physically wouldn’t be able to because I’ve already requested a day off of work they need me there and this is a BRAND NEW job. Sounds like feral beast is trying to sabotage my job but I’m keeping that to myself. I told him he can go if he wants, but I can’t and I’ve already requested off for bday party. He says he won’t go without me and that even if we did go we would only have to see her at dinner as we would have our own room and everything and be left alone.

WHAT THE FUCK THO? Is this feral mongrel bitch really trying to act like she didn’t just try to assault me two weekends ago? Like everything’s fine? Like does she really think I’d give up my personal WEEKEND and risk sacrificing my job to spend time with HER upstate in the middle of fucking nowhere in the Catskills? I seriously doubt she would leave us alone, as she never could even leave me and bf alone when I’d come over and barge into his room and talk about herself for over an hour and get mad when I didn’t ask her to go on or elaborate on her glorious life and days. Can someone tell me wtf this woman is thinking tho? Is she trying to smooth things over? Is this a plot to get me on her turf and push my buttons? Or maybe a plot to murder me and dump my body in the mountains so she can have her baby boy all to herself???

UPDATE:
She started on my bf again and told him that me and him need therapy for our anger issues (apparently we have anger issues because we have both raised our voices to her) but she is perfectly fine despite screaming and trying to assault a 6 month pregnant woman ok then..."
777,"This is the tale/rant of how I found out about the lies, manipulations, and shit-talking of my MIL (who I will refer to as MM), and why I finally decided to go NC. I'm going to condense as much as possible, but this may be a long one. 

DH and I have been together for almost 10 years, and from the time we began dating, he would tell me how horrible MM was. I, being naive and coming from a wonderful and loving family, thought maybe he was just bitter over a few of her mistakes from his childhood. I began forming a friendship with MM while DH and I were dating, and I saw a side of her that I don't think most people see. I saw a woman who was very willing to help anyone she could, a woman who had been hurt terribly in her life, and mostly, I saw a chance to help DH mend the scars of the past if he wanted. From the very beginning, MM would constantly tell me how pretty, kind, thoughtful, smart, etc. I was. It was all love and endearment until DH and I decided to get married.

Following a short engagement, we decided to just get married at the courthouse to save money for a honeymoon. We told his family and my family, and we invited both our parents to join us. MM made it clear she would not attend and barred FIL from attending as well. My parents and grandparents were present in full support of us. Things were rocky after that, but I let it all go. Out of nowhere, MM acted as if she had no issues with our marriage about a year after our ""wedding"". At this point, things went pretty much back to the way they were before the engagement. She would call me and talk about her day to day life, ask how I was doing, and various other niceties. Occasionally, she would call me to ask for advice on personal issues she was facing. About two years into our marriage, DH and I went to visit DH's aunt (MM's sister) who lived a few states away. It was during this visit that DH's aunt got a little too drunk and began telling us all of these secrets about the things MM had been saying about our marriage and in general, me. Turns out, MM had serious issues with how DH and I got married at the courthouse, and she did not get to walk her son down the aisle, have a mother/son dance, etc. The stuff directed at me was far more aggressive. According to MM, I was using DH for his money (which he had very little of when we got married), I was going to trap DH by getting pregnant and leaving him so I could get alimony and child support, and above all, I was not pretty enough for DH. The last one stung more than anything else, seriously damaging my self-esteem for a while. I didn't want to cause any issues with the rest of DH's family, so I got him to agree that we just let it go and move on with our happy lives. 

Things slowly crept up to everyone being kind to one another again, MM included. Unfortunately, I let my guard down a second time. I thought ""maybe she has changed"". MM and I began getting lunch together and calling each other again, and instead of just letting go of MM's cruel remarks, I forgot about it entirely. Life went on, and about 4 years into our marriage, DH and I decided that we did not want children. We decided, after a ton of research, that having DH get a vasectomy was the best way to go. The surgery went well, and we did not have to worry about an accidental pregnancy. We were over the moon, and life just kept getting better for us. About once a week, MM and I would get together to go shopping, grab lunch, or even just sit and talk together at my house or hers. So yeah, everything seemed perfect. I had a great family, a husband who treasured me and our relationship, and on top of it all, I had a great set of in-laws who were like my second pair of parents. DH and I even went on double dates with his parents about once a month. Additionally, DH's grandparents (MIL's parents) moved to our state, so I got close with them over the course of the two years they have been here. Things seemed better between DH and MM as well. I say all of this because I really want to paint an accurate picture of how it seemed like MM was not only my MIL, but also my friend. That was up until last month. It was truly a ""straw that broke the camel's back"" moment. DH was in the same state as his aunt, for work, and decided to visit with her since he hadn't seen her in a while. They went out to dinner and she had a few drinks. This is when she decided to tell DH about all the awful things MM had been saying about our relationship and me, again... According to MM, DH getting a vasectomy was a horrible mistake because DH and I are going to get divorced, he will remarry and want children with his second wife. To unpack all of this, and to see if it was true, I called DH's grandmother, as she has become another source of love and wisdom in my life. She confirmed that it was all true, verbatim, while also letting me know that MM had told her the same thing and went on a rant about how I have ruined DH's life. DH's grandmother also let me know that she didn't believe any of it to be true, and she understood how hurt I was by it. 

Now, if you've made it this far, you may be wondering what I did with this information. I simply decided to let it go, but this time, I am going NC. I do not call her, and I avoid her at all costs. I have learned my lesson. DH has also decided to go NC for these reasons and a few of his own. It's been a month, and I am convinced I made the right decision. Life is constantly getting better. Thanks for hearing me out!"
778,"Hello everyone, 

Went interstate to see JNMIL last week. I was talking about getting my son’s shots when he’s born and all that type of jazz. 

Suddenly she goes  “if you just expose him to those diseases (chickenpox, measles, etc) when he’s old enough he will build up an immunity to it and won’t risk getting them when he’s older!!” 

Y’all, I was gobsmacked. Then she continued on, “it’s what MY mother did with us!! If she knew a kid in the neighbourhood was sick she’d send us to play with them!!” 

I let her know we’d still be getting our son’s shots, thank you very fucking much, but most of the people I have spoken to are in favour of getting the shots and then exposing the kids to those diseases??? I’m sorry but I will never ever deliberately expose my kid to a live strain of a disease, no matter what it is! Am I being too germaphobic by saying this? Do people actually expose their kids to the disease for immunity instead of getting a shot?? It seems wrong to me to deliberately put your kid in harms way like that. 

SO was just as shocked as I was and definitely will be keeping his mother the fuck away from our kid. (She’s a chain smoker too, and didn’t even bother washing her hands or changing her clothes with her other grandchildren)

EDIT: I don’t think I was really clear, but I know vaccines contain a “dead”/ weakened strain of the disease. That’s how they teach your body to fight the disease. 

But there’s no way I will deliberately expose my kid to someone with an absolutely contractable ALIVE and STRONG strain of a disease."
779,"She never calls me, And I know she’s never going to without wanting something from me..  She hasn’t even spoke to me in months, I don’t know why I had my hopes up even the slightest bit.

Some backstory: My mother left when I was 16, packed my sister and a few belongings in ‘her’ car and took a trip to grandma’s house. Just kidding! She went to Texas to live with a man she had been having an emotional affair with. I’m now almost 22 and still dealing with all the mental health issues she caused me. But that’s it’s own story.

Back to today though!

There was a rather large fire at my friends house today, where I happened to be staying as this was their only day off for a while. I was asleep on their couch a bit hungover, I could hear some yelling that woke me up once or twice but it was very spaced out and I didn’t think much of it. I couldn’t smell or see any smoke and went back to sleep each time.

The fire started around 2 pm, and at about 3 we both woke up. At this point we were *still* unaware of the fire, believe it or not. My sense of smell is really fucked up and all of his windows were covered with curtains or blankets so it wasn’t until we went outside to smoke to see how bad it actually was. 

At this point we could tell it was raging but at the same time the smoke was pretty thick and we couldn’t tell for sure where the flames were coming from, just that they were pretty close to us. We didn’t know how much time we had to get out of the area or if we have had any at all, but we refused to leave without his puppy and ended up taking the risk to go back in ourselves.

We took a few minutes to quickly get dressed and pack a bag. Just in time as well because as soon as were it the door we could see the flames right behind his house.

As we were running out though thankfully there were police cars driving through the trailer park to help evacuation, an officer saw us and ushered us into his car where he took us out of the smoke and left us with other officers and first responders.

I wasn’t able to show much emotion during the panic of us leaving, the anxiety and shock of it all didn’t set in for me until we had left the area completely.

8 hours later the fire is still zero percent contained and the thought of what would have happened to us if we had slept just a few more minutes caused a lot of panic attacks.

8 hours later and she still can’t be bothered to call and check in on her fucking child. Not even a text.

The thought she might not know did occur to me, as she does live in Texas. The moment I found out my father told her about the fire.. I was fucking livid. I know for a fact if this had been one of my sisters she would have blown up their phone until she got a hold of them.

I don’t understand why I’m the only one that doesn’t matter. I don’t understand why I am worth less to her than my sisters are.

I don’t understand why I still *care*.



I’m sorry if this jumps around or parts don’t make sense, I’m on mobile and still really shaky but I needed to vent somewhere before I lost my shit entirely.

BINGO! 


We all knew it was just a matter of time!

It's been a while so let's do a little info and jump right into the fuckery. (Backstory already logged in the archives).

Full Metal Batshit has constantly been sending boxes of garbage to our kid but hubs intercepts it so I don't see them and takes them to work to pass out like a Swap Meet Santa Claus. This causes me way less stress so it works out nicely. (I've always known this. He didn't hide it or anything.)

She still messages him on every holiday and birthday and anniversary just to ruin my mood but it's mostly a generic greeting and nothing more...UNTIL yesterday at 4:12 am.

Message:  *Son I did not know if you wanted to know but I just got out of the hospital for brain surgery. I wish we could just talk. I love you. Can you not look into your heart and see the love we have for you! Please?*

Let's break this down. 

Obviously it's Christmas Cancer. Why am I such a  frigid bitch and certain this is tomfoolery?

If it was an EMERGENCY, someone would have called him *before or during* said procedure. Cause like, obviously they had access to his number.

She exaggerates constantly, like bitch prolly got stitches from walking into something because she's known to do that. Or it was to fix a migraine or possibly she scratched her chin shaving, who knows. (We know she's fucking dim so face could = brain.)

If she knew it was going to happen why not try to reconnect *before* the procedure?

It's fucking 4:12 AM you uncultured anglerfish! Most people are asleep!

There's no apology in there. 

The first word is used to show possession. Not his name, who he is to *her*. How he's a child and inferior. 

He's also a husband and a father.

""Just got out"" is a relative term.  This could have been 6 hours to six months ago. 

The rug sweeping... ""La, la, la, la let's be friends!""

Holidays are around the corner and she's seriously obsessed with Christmas.

We've all seen this shit before. 

Now, he worried about it for a good 14 hours before he told me so he could work through that fog. I'm totally ok with that. He needed to process and it's not a ""wake a person up"" kinda text or conversation to have while he was at work.

 It did not past the smell test. 

If this bitch is claiming she was narcissistic because she had a growth, it can't explain 60+ years of being a selfish, manipulative douche cannoe so...

Nothing shows she's changed or admits she was wrong. 

As soon as I asked what was up he hesitated and I yelled ""Christmas Cancer!"" And he goes ""I knew there was a term!"" And we laughed and laughed... and  so now we're totally going to hell. (We do not wish her ill or any harm, just maybe across the country...without cell phone reception).

We may have fallen for it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids but since this is more common than a spotted banana we're sticking to the Nope Boat that has been sailing quite smoothly these past couple of years

*Can you not look into your heart and see the love we have for you!*

I've only ever tore you down.

I've never admitted fault.

I manipulated you and controlled you.

I make your step father do my bidding.

It's your wife's fault you stopped letting me abuse you so I say hateful things about her but ask you to keep it a secret because I'm a dill weed and don't know what a healthy marriage is like.

I have no idea who you are as a person. 

I thought you were lying. 

That's silly.

It's always your fault.


Bonus dick move: His dad actually has cancer and she knows (they're divorced)."
781,"So this is a random memory I have about my grandmother who raised me. Grandmother has a son who went to prison for several years when I was younger. When he was scheduled to be released he sent a box of personal effects home, which was mostly pictures of women. I recognized one of the pictures as a girl from our church and commented about how I didn't know they knew each other considering the fact that he didnt go to our church before he went to jail. I turned over the picture and it said "" I miss you very much and I can't wait to give you a big kiss!"". Yall. It was in my grandmother's handwriting! I recognized it quickly because she wrote him at least once a week for years. I told her that was weird and from what I can remember she pretty much dismissed me. It may not be full on jocasta but definitely inappropriate."
782,"So A year ago I posted about finally moving out from Krazy Kathy and I had been No contact since then.

Well some stuff happened back in june and my husband and I separated for a bit. We're better now, but for a week I was living with my mother...

During that time frame, her and her boyfriend ended up in an altercation that resulted in him being arrested. I was a witness. There were protective orders taken out against him for me and my mother.

September, I get a subpoena to show up to the court trial. I ask KK if she can pick me up and she says No because she will have her boyfriend with her. She tells me her order was dropped but mine wasn't. (!) She disappears again until I get the call that the trial has been postponed, at which point she told me it got moved to Oct 10th.

So today, my husband, who works days, takes the morning off to take me to court. It's 1 hour 1 way and we have a 93 Camry. So semi-efficient but we're still out gas money and about 4 hours of wages for my husband. The case is the second one called on the docket and it turns out that the boyfriend had taken a plea deal and I was never called. (!) Also when I asked the prosecutor about it, my protective order was reversed when my mom's was reversed as part of his release order. (!) 

I message KK about what happened today at the court house and she nonchalantly texts back ""Oh yeah, he took a plea. It's not going to trial"" AFTER we already wasted gas and had missed wages to attend. Now that my husband and I are doing better, I'm sorely tempted to tell her off and block her again. So far I've already sent her that A) She could have told us that any time before we went seeing as for how she had the information and B) As a witness I didn't have access to the same information as her. I was subpoenaed so I didn't have a choice about going or not. Nobody from the PA or DA office called me to let me know I wasn't needed anymore. 


I'm honestly pretty fucking pissed that we wasted the gas and got missed wages when we're already behind on rent and have other debts piling up (we had an emergency in august so our savings got wiped....and we're on single income while I go to school) 

UGH I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SHE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.......After all, if she knows it I have to know it already, right?"
783,"This is an old story but since DH's birthday is coming up, I'm reminded of a gem from a couple of years ago.

What is it with the theme here of JNMIL's trying to ruin birthdays, holidays, or other important dates for people? Especially if they aren't the ones being celebrated?

My JNMIL had made reservations for a family dinner for my DH (35M)- something they do every year for nearly everyone but the in-laws... but that's another story. Sometimes these dinners are enjoyable, and other times they are a drama filled, alcohol fueled nightmare. Unfortunately DH was still very much in the FOG so I went with it- it was his birthday after all and that's what he wanted.

I thought I'd do something nice for DH so I planned to bring a cake to the restaurant.  I had done this once with our group of friends when we lived further away where family dinners weren't possible... and DH loved it! This is where it gets just plain odd. I told JNMIL about the cake.JNMIL: ""DH is so very shy and has always been since he's been a little boy. You're going to embarrass him if you do something like that. He hates that sort of attention. I know, I'm his mother.""Me: ""Ummm... ok.  He liked it when I did it before.""But she kept insisting that I shouldn't bring a cake because it would just make him so self conscious. That's when I started to think I must've read him wrong the last time because he looked like he enjoyed it. Well she got to me. I caved and I didn't bring a cake (I had no clue how much of a JN she was at that time).

Fast forward to the night of DH's birthday dinner and everyone is about to get up to leave- it was actually a great night up until that point. Then, I hear JNMIL say: ""Waaaaait everyone... we haven't done the best part!"" She then pulls out a fuckin' birthday cake out from under the table- complete with candles. What. The. Fuck? THEN.. she looked straight at me and smirked as she began to sing ""Happy Birthday"".

So in one single moment she simultaneously stole the spotlight for herself on DH's birthday,  successfully gaslighted me into thinking I didn't know DH as well as she did, all the while making my DH think she was doing something so very sweet. What a Bitch."
784,"I know it's only the beginning of October, but my holiday anxiety usually hits around this time each year. And after my JNMIL has shown her ass one too many times this year, I am hoping DH will allow me to set out holiday gatherings without putting up a fight about it. I really don't want my little one involved either, but I'm afraid that would be way too much strain on DH. How does everyone else handle the holidays? 

DH is currently having limited contact with JNMIL. I am personally NC- just ignore every text she sends and have made sure to not be in a room with her for the past 5 months."
785,"Update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/deouc7/mil_using_so_as_a_piggy_bank_need_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Still on mobile, sorry if formatting gets messed up. Still looking for advice too. I just wanted to clear 2 things up off the bat, 

1. FMIL does have a job, she actually has 2 but her second job is limited part-time and based off client needs so the income from it is low. She earns a modest amount but definitely not enough for her plus 3 ""kids"" 

2. My SO does not give his mom cash whenever she asks. She will state a bill or expense she can't afford and either he or his 26yo sister (most times my SO) will help pay it. FMIL does not get money for her own luxury items, only for things that go towards the house or his siblings. 

Not to fully exonerate her of her shitty behaviour but these are things I didn't make clear. Her actual shitty behaviour has made me so much angrier than just annoying us for money. 


Now for the update! 

The night after I posted my SO and I got a chance to talk in more detail as he had met up with his family to further discuss this while I was at work. Essentially this story comes down to the 3 laptops preciously mentioned in my last post as being unused. This was not case. There are 3 laptops but they aren't all necessarily going unused. I'll break it down by laptop-

Laptop one is older and is currently being used by 18yo. 18yo is complaining that the laptop is old and not that good to which SO brought up her scholarships and 18yo tried to claim she couldn't use her scholarship money to get a laptop. I don't think this was done out of wanting her big brother to buy her a new laptop but that she literally just doesn't know how her own scholarship works. SO told her she absolutely can use that money to get a laptop for school and now she is so that's taken care of. 

Laptop two is unusable. The internal parts are apparently okay but the screen is broken beyond repair and my SO can't take this particular type of laptop apart himself. We want to try and get it refurbished but most likely we'll just end up have my to sell it for parts to someone who can work with this style of laptop. 

Laptop three is the one that makes me angry. It is about 5 years old, runs perfectly well and still has a decent battery but 24yo won't let anyone have it. Brief background, about a year ago 24yo got herself a brand-new Surface Pro to replace Laptop Three. She didn't do this because Laptop Three was bad but because she didn't like walking around with an older, heavier laptop. This is now the reason she won't give anyone Laptop Three. 

16yo (the one with the desktop) is a really good kid. He understands the value of laptops and understands what he is asking his brother for when he asked for a laptop. 16yo even saved up several hundred dollars to help pay for his own laptop. 

(Aside; 16yo apparently needs the laptop because high school has changed A LOT since my time and his school wants everyone to have a laptop for classwork. The school does have Chromebooks people can sign out but there aren't enough to go around and the school is encouraging students to get/bring their own if possible) 

SO and I still want to take Laptop Three from 24yo, refurbish it for 16yo so he (and us) can save money not having to buy a new one. But 24yo is throwing a fit saying her 16yo brother can't have it because it's too heavy (that is literally what she said to SO). In theory, FMIL would have stepped in and helped persuade 24yo but instead FMIL sided with 24yo and is 100% enabling her shitty behaviour. 

FMIL just wants everyone to leave 24yo alone and get 16yo a new laptop so we don't upset 24yo anymore. SO is pissed. I'm fucking pissed. This bitch is playing favourites with her fucking kids and letting her son's suffer. She has always done this, FMIL treats the girls like angles and her sons like slaves. I feel so bad for 16yo. He doesn't deserve this and SO agrees. 16yo shouldn't have to pay for a new laptop himself when his sister has one she should be at the least lending him. 

If one of SO siblings really deserves a nice gift it is 16yo. He doesn't deserve to be punished for his selfish sisters behaviour or his mom's favouritism. Still not sure what we're going to do, but it looks like we're going to be buying 16yo a nice (but used) laptop for his birthday next month."
786,"Just important to add. My FMIL barely speaks English. 

I’m just going to add little events that my FMIL has done since FDH and I have moved out.

-shown up to the house to help with Reno’s. Told me I shouldn’t be eating that(pizza), I should join a gym and I’m fat. I’ve struggled with disordered eating for years. I responded with: it’s not any of your business what my weight is or what I eat. Your son isn’t dating me for my weight. You shouldn’t comment on people’s weight when you don’t know their history with food. Yet constantly tries to make me eat more every time we eat together.

-makes comments to FSIL that I’m starving FDH and he never eats. Shows constantly up at the house with large amounts of food when I’ve made food for the week. 

-comes over and bangs on the door if FDH is ignoring her calls. Cries and speaks loudly waving her arms around. Slamming the door when running out."
787,"Long time lurker, first time poster, cross posting in justnomil since it concerns her too.

I’ve been married to my DH for 6 years, we now have two young children. My husbands entire family are a big dysfunctional herd of just nos. His family includes JNmil, jnfil, 2 jnsil and their husbands plus a handful of nieces and nephews (young children) I’ve been grey rocking them since the beginning and maintaining pretty lc. I’ll go to family events but generally see them maybe once a month. Most communication goes through my DH, which I absolutely prefer. There really is no golden child in the family, my mil will make whichever child is pissing her off the most the scape goat du jour.  My two sils generally gang up on my husband for no identifiable reason..I presume to boost their own egos? The amount of straight up shit they have pulled could be made into a Netflix series, but those are posts for another time.

So why I’m here...The past few months have been just a series of unfortunate events for my family (DH and LOs) from my health problems to my littlest LO’s health problems to home renovation problems to mild cash flow problems, we’ve been going through a tough time. The JN herd has not only been completely unsupportive but they have been making life harder for us. (Sadly unsurprising) It got to the point my husband just had enough and texted both SIL calling them out for their crap and tried to work through the issues. (There’s a big family event coming up and he didn’t want there to be any awkwardness) SIL #1 ignored him. SIL#2 flipped the f out, turned everything around on him, typical narc bs. I’m certain MIL was in the background spinning webs of lies to escalate the situation. DH went NC for a month and then broke the silence to let them know he would be attending the family event ( it was up in the air for a while, myself and kids are not attending due to health issues). Now it seems like the past few months are going to get swept under the carpet never to be spoken of again. 

I’m just done, this was really the last straw for me. They insulted my husband, my home and my children. I’ve had enough, I did not grow up with a family like this and I have no patience for backstabbing bullshit. I’d be fine if I never had to see any of them again. I adore my nieces and nephews and I’d like my children to have a relationship with them, but how long would it be before my sil’s feelings rubbed off on their children? 

So my question is how the f do I navigate NC for myself and children when my husband will not and may never be able to cut ties? I know it will hurt my husband if I tell him my true feelings (he knows I’m pissed but not to the extent of forever NC) 

Before anyone gives my husband any grief, he has always put us first. He does stand up to his family on a regular basis and will go lc or nc when needed. I just don’t think he’ll ever get to the point where I am and I understand that, it’s hard having an entire family of JNs. I just don’t know what to do."
788,"Whenever she says something dumb/pointless, you have to reply to her immediately or else she won't shut up. Like, she has to be CONSTANTLY reminded that she's being listened to. It drives me fucking craaaaaazy. Doesn't matter who it is. If you don't at least say ""okay"" or ""yeah"" when she finishes a thought, she'll get obnoxious until you respond. 


""How does that sound?"" 

""You see what I mean?"" 

*""Hello?""* - That one drives me the craziest. 

""All right?""

""Okay?"" 

""You like the sound of that?"" 

""Don't you think?""


It doesn't help that she has the worst voice in the world. Just when you think she's done talking, when it seemed like she was talking to herself the whole time, she'll aggressively use one of those lines on you to make sure you're paying attention to her. Gaaah. 


It's such a small thing, but I wonder if any of your MILs talk like this. It stresses me out to deal with adults who need undivided attention, 24/7."
789,Hey so to start off my parents are Indian and very religious parents. We live in a nice house in a good neighborhood. Ever since freshman year I had one friend that I truly would do everything with it and hanged out with every single day. I used to tell my mom I was going to play basketball but instead go to his house and smoke a shit ton of weed everyday. It was fun and the best moments of my life. Deep down I felt bad but I knew I could never get caught. EVENTUALLY I got caught with selling and doing weed by my parents and they freak out. I couldn’t take it. They became super noisy and checked my phone and found all of my friends shit on Snapchat. However they still gave my best friend a chance. Fast forward to Sophomore year me and my best friend were at my house and we took edibles. Then my parents came home and FOUND US FUCKED UP. My mom immediately dropped my friend back to his house and had a straight talk with me. My friend was fine since his parents are fine with him smoking sometimes. She told me I could NEVER hangout or even get close with him. I still  hangout with him in school and do everything with each other. We have a bond that we can’t break and makes both of us happy. We have so much in common and have the time of our lives with each other.  I’m currently in Sophomore year and I’m still hanging with the same friends in school. I need help to to find a way to help my parents understand to hangout with him or my other friends or find a way to. I also felt that I wish my parents would understand me and control my usage and to be a fun and social thing. However my parents say that they have a “family name” to keep up and I hate that. I can’t stand it and this thing drives me crazy.
790,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here. I'm a little bit confused and need some help/advice.

On Monday evening, after a very long pregnancy with a failed induction, I had a C-section and finally welcomed DS into the world. He is my first child and I ADORE him.

We were home by Tuesday evening and had our first visitors on Wednesday evening (last night). My mum, 2 sisters, BIL, SIL and nephew were all over. I was discussing with my BIL about overnight stays - our first planned night away from DS is for 2 nights at the end of next April so D(ear)H and I can celebrate our anniversary. This is obviously 6 months away, we are just super organised and like to be on top of things!

For those two nights, DS will be staying at my JYMIL's. She lives half an hour away from the fancy hotel we will be staying at, so if there are any problems we're all close by.  Whilst discussing this with BIL, I said, word for word, ""to be honest, I know 6 months is still quite young, but DS needs to get used to staying at MIL's sooner rather than later.""

To me, this was an offhand remark. MIL lives an hour away from us, so if he has any problems settling there, it's a long drive to go back to get him. The younger he is when he gets used to being in her house the better. That's all I meant, and that's all everyone in the room took it as.

Apart from my mum. Ugh.

She left within 5 minutes, took both my sisters and didn't even say goodbye. I have sent her several messages and tried to call her 3 times and she has ignored me for TWENTY FOUR HOURS. Finally, I texted her saying, ""look mum, I can't fix whatever it is I've done wrong if you don't tell me what it is.""

She then sent me this message:
""Okay. You hurt me with your comment about how (DS) needs to get used to sleeping at (MIL)'s sooner rather than later. I wasn't bothered when you said he was going there when you first go out, that's fine, but when you followed it up with he needs to get used to sleeping at theirs sooner rather than later I just thought what the hell, and in front of people I don't really know either. What am I? The useless waste of space who isn't capable of looking after your baby for a night? Do you really think that little of me? I came home and cried all night.""

I mean... what?! I didn't even know how to reply! I don't understand what I did that was so wrong! I don't understand why she's bothered I said that comment in front of my BIL and SIL? I don't understand how what I said was relevant to her in any way?? I could understand it if I'd implied he was never going go stay at her house, or if I'd insulted her childcare, but she wasn't mentioned at all.

Anyway, I sent her a big rambling message back (sorry in advance):
""I'm not sure how to reply to you because I dont want to undermine your feelings or anything, but I cant wrap my head around why that comment upset you. It had nothing to do with you at all? It wasnt like I said he is never going to be staying at yours so he needs to get used to sleeping at MIL's? Him staying over at MIL's has nothing to do with you whatsoever so I'm genuinely confused as to why you are upset. I dont even know how to apologise because I've not said anything hurtful about you, you've just somehow managed to make an offhand comment about MIL about you instead, and that's through your own insecurity, not through any action of mine.
   Obviously he is going to be staying over at your house, and it was never said or even vaguely implied that he WASNT going to be staying at yours? The reason he needs to get used to staying at MIL's is because he wont be seeing her half as much as he will be seeing you, so he wont be as comfortable at her house as he will be at yours - and if he is uncomfortable there, it's much more of a trek to go and get him if he wants to come home. THAT is why he needs to get used to staying there. It has nothing to do with your parenting.
   Saying that, however, I am NOT impressed with you. I have just had a baby AND major surgery. You are supposed to be my main support right now (other than DH) and instead you have ignored me for the past 24 hours. Even worse, it's not even because of something hurtful or rude I said or implied about you! That is not appropriate behaviour at all. I dont know why you have chosen this moment in time to have a ""me me me"" moment but you need to get over yourself. Are you going to take this out on your grandson and not come up then?? Because you're mad with me over something YOU'VE taken badly?""

She replied to all that with ""Okay that's fine. Don't ask me what's wrong in future."" and has since gone back to ignoring me. She won't answer the phone.

I'm deeply upset and frustrated. I have a 3 day old baby and I'm recovering from a C-section; my mum is supposed to be helping me, not making things worse! 

She's always been sensitive, but this is a whole new level of selfish. And over something SOOO small and stupid! I don't know what to do. Please help me. :("
791,"Hello fellow redditers. It's always bittersweet for me to post an update here. Sweet because of all the good advice I can always gather from you all. Bitter because it always means that the situation with the ILs is getting worse. So here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

We still witness no evolution on MIL, SIL or FIL's behaviour. Please look at my previous posts for details. (Antivax boundaries stompers)

Yesterday was LO's 2 months anniversary, and I felt in my guts that we wouldn't be able to enjoy that special little day peacefully. I was right.

MIL had sent a message to DH the week before. She wanted to know if DH and LO were fine, and if LO ""wasn't too annoying with his breastfeeding"". I guess it was her way of finally asking about me and be judgemental of our choices at the same time.

DH wanted to take his time to answer back. After all the shit they pulled on us, especially him, he deserved to take all the time he needed to write back. Especially when we're both exhausted and busy.

Well he didn't answer fast enough, of course! Yesterday, SIL messaged him. ""Please call mom, she's not okay"".

Then, 4 minutes later, SIL calls him. He's at work: obviously he doesn't answer.

SIL throws a tantrum. ""I want to call you later"".""Well, we'll see. Or send me a message if you wanna tell me something""

""Stop your bullshit DH. Call me back or you won't know what is up with our dad"".

You fucking gatekeeping, emotionnal blackmailing COW. Their Dad, FIL, is an asshole, and he's also sick all the time. Is he sick again? How much? Is he in the hospital? Well unless DH bent the knee to his fucking bitch of a sister, he wouldn't know.

He chose to drop the convo, and the rope. And blocked her.

Then, in an attempt to get things back to normal with his mom and give her a chance to say whatever is on her mind, he sent her something like ""Hey Mom. SIL told me you were not okay. What is happening?""

Buckle up. She answered: ""I'm surprised you don't know... I'm taking pills to hold on and put a fake smile on my face. Live your life, don't forget you're important to me. ""

DH saw RED. Here's what he sent back: ""YOU chose not to get your pertussis shots, and not be able to meet LO on the first weeks of his life, or coming to help and support us. We were NEVER going to keep him away from you. Your choices have consequences. Now I cannot put up anymore with passive-agressive behaviours like the crappy guilt memes you post on Facebook, or agressives ones like SIL's. I don't want that for myself, OP, and of course LO. So I'm taking your advice mom: I'm off to live my life. Goodbye"".

Cue the facebook and phone messages, ""Why are you so meeeeeeeean, It is because my boyfriend won't get the shots that I don't get them either, I've been dreaming for soooo looong about holding my little ooooone, I didn't call you for two months because I didn't want to bother you, you are so meeeeeeaaaaan......""

ETA: she was also moaning ""I don't understand why you do this to meeee!"" I told DH: ""You explained what she did. What she chose. She still doesn't understand. How long are you gonna keep explaining things she cannot admit""?

I think we already have quite a good display of the typical JustNo behaviour here. Please tell me, friends. Have we reached that thing call extiction burst? I don't think so. Do we have to brace ourselves for worse, later?"
792,"Edit: Thank you ALL so much; I’m very appreciative of the overwhelming response. Also thank you for the Gold! I’ve received tons of valuable input on this thread. So thank you, again! 

My MIL (single &amp; 72) is not receptive and she is unwilling to compromise.  She is extremely passive aggressive and is very easily offended.  She feels entitled to undermine and overstep my stay-at-home daily routine.  She constantly vibes for my husband’s attention. 
She has lived with us (my husband is her first born son) for a total of almost 2 1/2 years, since retiring from a lifetime of missionary service over seas.  We also have three young adult children that are living at home.

When I’ve tried to approach her to talk with her about her actions she always gets defensive, retreats to her bedroom and then acts moody for hours at a time.  She then will come out of her room and act like nothing ever happened.  As a result, resolution is never achieved.

She instigates my husband emotionally by twisting my words to him behind my back, which provokes him to have resentment &amp; anger towards me.  She tells my husband and our daughter that I “lecture” her and that I am disrespectful towards her.

When I ask my MIL what her motive is she ignores me and refuses to answer me.
Having family  “pow wows” doesn’t work because it has shown true, countless times, that she sits there and doesn’t speak up to bring clarity.  This makes it seem to my husband that I am being vindictive towards her.

Any time I have tried to go to my husband to talk about his mom’s deliberate actions I am instantly met with resistance (ordered to stop talking) and told, “mom can do whatever she wants, leave her alone”, “she’s just an old lady”, “wait a minute, you told her you are the woman of the house?!!!”, “ you embarrass me when you can’t be nice to her”.

There has never been any initiative by my husband to have a talk with his mom about her actions.  Instead, he always succeeds in justifying her behaviors towards me and refuses to believe anything I try to tell him.  He also ignores the fact that she has also started to transfer her “passive aggressive” behaviors onto our children. 

Even when my husband doesn’t know all the facts, he automatically assumes that I am instigating every “situation” that arises.  He will never give me the benefit of the doubt and never shows concern for my well-being, even after my attempts to let him know the living arrangement with his mom is becoming too stressful for me.  I even researched alternate affordable living options, but he refused to discuss the topic with me.  He feels that because we have an extra bedroom that it doesn’t make sense for her to move out.
He also told me that he wants his mom to live with us so he can make up for lost time (now that she’s retired).

After my husband recently told me, in front of our kids, that his mom is going to live with us no matter what and that my voice doesn’t matter and won’t be heard, I made the decision to tell him that I have decided to release myself from our marriage.   I have too much respect for myself and my kids to allow this craziness to continue!  

The next morning my husband brought me coffee and asked me what could be done to save our marriage.  I think he realized, after giving it some serious thought, that he was not willing to sacrifice the life that we have made together over the last 24 1/2 years.  

I explained to him that I can no longer “compete” with his mom for my rightful place in his life and in our home.   I explained that I don’t feel cherished and protected by him when he constantly allows her to manipulate him against me. 

I told him that he will have to agree that his mom can no longer live with us and be allowed to feel at liberty to use our home as her “base”, to come and go as she pleases.  She will only be allowed to come for short visits and will be treated as a guest in our home, and not as though she has the same privileges as our immediate family.

12 hours after I made my decision to start taking action steps to separate from him, my husband has now decided that our marriage and well-being of our kids is his priority over his mom.  He has agreed to help her find another place to live.  It is proving to be difficult for him to do this, however, he is following through with it!!  It makes me realize how much of a “hold” she has on him, thus being the reason why the dysfunction heightened as time progressed, while living in such close quarters together.

I have lost so much respect for my MIL since she came to live with us.  
I have learned a great lesson through this terrible experience.  I have chosen to forgive her, however, I will never forget how she took advantage of us and entitled herself to cause so much chaos in our home.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
793,"I will be starting a new job next week (on Tuesday) and was so hoping to have a week off to decompress. Instead we will be spending the next 4.5 days with my in-laws. 
We are not being forced. It is Thanksgiving and they have been through a lot  these past weeks. We are working on boundaries but we want to be supportive. We are doing the right thing but a little part of me still wishes that my only vacation until baby comes is spoken for :( 
We are also announcing our pregnancy tomorrow (on the book of faces, I know, I know!!!!). I want to make sure MIL is not with us when we post it. So I'll be talking to my D(ear)H tonight. We will be in her house and it might be selfish but I don't want her to have a part in announcing this  (even just SEEING the post before it goes out) because of previous JN behaviour and entitlement re: upcoming LO. 

This is mostly just a rant so I can be cool and calm before talking to DH about it. 

Also, for those of you in the US and Canada, I wish you all the best of luck over the Holidays! May we all be incident free! 

Oh extra bonus! My AIL will be staying at our house while we are away. We had zero clue. We suspect all was arranged through MIL. We are not accusing yet but will ask MIL if she knew. Aunt has stayed with us before as she works in our city over weekends and holidays. No problem. We got a message from her yesterday basically saying ""can you register my friends car for parking as he might stay the night while I'm up."" Maybe that is her way of asking to stay (not likely because AIL is mostly JY) but our impression is that it had already been arrange.  If MIL did grant permission we will then politely request that a) she direct any requests for staying as a guest in OUR home to the HOMEOWNERS  b) remind her she has no authority to grant people access to our home. 
And also.... Wtf would you not even tell us? 

Happy Thanksgiving! Gobble gobble!"
794,"I might have the most pushy and judgmental future mother in law. My boyfriend and I will get engaged soon but we've been together for nearly a decade. His mother and I used to get along really well until about 2 years ago when there was family drama that I was pulled into that I didn't want to be and what was communicated was a misunderstanding. She apologized and I thought we moved on. However, after that event, I think she now thinks she needs to compete with me for her son's affection? approval?

She's made a number of hurtful comments that I feel like cannot be taken back. Among them:

* My family is to poor to throw the type of wedding that is suitable for her family / people of their stature (my family is definitely upper middle class but not as wealthy as hers)
* I should get my back fat lasered if I plan on wearing such a revealing wedding dress

The list goes on. In addition to these things, she thinks my taste is tacky, I have no idea what I'm doing throwing a wedding and she wants to hijack the whole thing. She revealed to another family member she wants to pay the wedding planner to play bad cop so she can play good cop and manipulate me into getting the wedding how she wants it. I'm not supposed to know that fact but is ZERO percent surprising given how pushy she is.

One day she started going on about how we should raise our children (we don't have any nor am I pregnant) and I finally told her that she needed to stop being so judgmental and to stop pushing an agenda with me. She started accusing me of being an exaggerator, pot stirrer, drama lover, etc. For weeks she sent me text messages with things like ""you're the daughter I've always wanted"" paired with ""this is why I don't have friends \[I do\] and I am the only one who she has these problems with \[I'm not\]"" After all of this conversation, there was no apology, she feels she is in the right, the problems with our relationship are all my fault, we agreed to disagree, and our relationship is disingenuously moving along.

It's been easy to push off a number of wedding topics as I could always say well we're not engaged. Now it's coming close to this time. What do I do? How do I rectify mom-in-law-zilla?

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: Because the question has been getting asked a lot. . . My FH does not think this behavior is acceptable nor does he think its okay.   He backs me up 100%.  He is realistic that that's his mom and she's in her sixties and she isn't going to change.  He doesn't think we need to listen to any of her suggestions and we'll just go with what we want at the end of the day.  I'm mostly looking for how I can operate better with her.  I'd like for this time to be fun and enjoyable."
795,"Any suggestions? My therapist suggested the tone. I'm trying to take the high road. The in-laws are coming to visit this weekend and I need to stick up for myself as it's unlikely ASD husband is ever going to do it.

Dear MIL,

We are, of course, happy when you guys pay a visit. And we are happy to facilitate a relationship with the kids and their grandparents. Family is important to us.

But it's important that I bring some things up. I get that I am not your ideal daughter-in-law, but there have been times when we do get along; I value our relationship. But, especially recently, there have also been times when I felt disrespected: criticizing my manners, making jabs about my mom, dismissiveness, and passive comments about other things you disapprove of. I'm not the only one who picks up on this.

I know that I'm not perfect either, and if I've said things that hurt your feelings, I apologize.

We strive to make family a place of comfort in a generally indifferent and uncaring world. Not yet another place of difficulty.

We are not a ""normal"" family. Nevermind that there's no such thing, that the energy required in projecting such things is better spent on actual family bonding. What DH and I do well: we try to be empathetic, caring, and loving. We work hard to help the children develop the practical and emotional tools they need to go out in the world. We also want them to know that we are there for them, even if they get it wrong. Give love; get love. That's the cycle we strive to keep going.

We've had many challenges over the past couple of years, and we have ongoing ones as well. None of us are ""neurotypical."" Members of our family have dealt with, or continue to deal with: anxiety, ADHD, Aspergers/ASD, depression, loss of income, PTSD, assault, dissolution of friendships, therapy, stalkers, panic attacks, theft, eating disorders, verbal abuse, emergency rooms, self-esteem problems, bullying, terminal illness in close friends... as I write this even, we are facing new &amp; surprising challenges and we are doing our best to rally. We don't need to discuss any of this with you. But this is just to say that if we don't seem ""normal,"" it's because we're not, and we hope you understand. We do the best we can.

Best,

DIL

Not necessary reading, but for context the last visit was like this:

796,"Yall, I am so pissed. 
I dont know why I thought different at all - but since my last blowup with my parents I changed my number, deleted all my family and their friends from IG and FB. I should have known Hot Ass Mess is already making the rounds because no one has asked me why.
 I did start with a therapist who told me that I was doing the right thing which helped my guilt. I was completely honest with my therapist, but it was our first session and as soon as I sat down and she was like "" what are you here for?"" The word vomit started and I didnt stop talking for 45min. But heres the newest thing. 
I  have a birthday party for my daughter this weekend. 
I was worried since I changed my number that my mothers sister and mother wouldn't be able to reach me about my address but I'm not a fan of them so I wasn't sure what to do. I was trying to involve them for my parents sake but there is hella history there.
Well my sister in law posted a picture and happy birthday msg to my daughter who had her first bday yesterday. Of course the first comment was my mothers sister and I was like well, I'll just message her on fb ( I deleted her but we had shared msgs before so we are connected)

I asked hey are you coming to the party, heres my address if you are.
She replied oh yes I'm bringing gma too. Wish you would make up with your parents makes me sad.

I should have stopped there but my stupid ass didnt. I replied they are welcome to come and there is more to the story.  She decided to press on. Dropping this gem : I am sure , just remember that life is really short and family is important.  You can’t get moments back.  Every makes mistakes and hurts each other but the gift is forgiveness.

Of course I had to walk away from my phone or i was  going to lose it and fuck up her life. Just tell her how my mother talks hella shit and tells her business to everyone and how my sister didnt invite her to her wedding on purpose etc. But i was like ok she doesnt know what she is talking about obvi let's explain to her - 
I replied  -I do forgive and dont hold any grudges against anyone. Forgiveness doesnt mean that there needs to be a relationship esp if people refuse to address the roots of a problem. I know I'm not perfect but I am not the only one in the wrong. To me they dont have to have a relationship with me to have one with daughter. That choice is being made. Please remember there are more than one side to a story. I'm not doing all this because it's fun.

And I knew I really fucked up in engaging at all when she dropped this:
""I don’t know what the root issue  is (and don’t want/need to know), but just remember they are your parents and have done more for you your whole life than you have ever done for them - because they love you.  You are a parent now and can understand that- you would never want to have something come between you and your daughter when she’s older.  Sometimes it just takes one person to open up the path and let go of the past and start looking forward to new beginnings and help others to do the same.  Love u and have a good day 🥰.""

Let me tell you I am still angry. I have been picturing how to put her in her bitch ass place since then. They do plan on coming to this party and if they do i will tell them that this is not the place or time but they need to take a long hard look at what they know of me and my relationship with my parents and where that info comes from because its not from me.

How you going to give bullshit advice without even knowing half the facts? My mother is a prolific liar. I can only imagine what shes said. My parents have done nothing for me besides the bare minimum which I understand is really all they have to do. Meanwhile they have helped my sisters with homes and cars and daycare and whatever else. I think my married sister is still on their cell phone plan and medical insurance while not paying for it and just recently moved out of their home. My other sister will prob move in there soon. I have helped my parents with so many things. From when I was a child until when they stopped responding to my texts and calls.  I have bought things with the promise of repayment and never been paid, done countless babysitting and unpaid labor. My dad still tries to get me to do dishes when I go there.  Also for her to talk about me being a mother and how I wouldnt like my daughter to be like this immediately pissed me off. HOW ARE YOU MESSAGING ME ( THE CHILD) TELLING ME TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON TO MY PARENTS AND NOT REALIZING HOW FUCKED UP AND CHILDISH THEY ARE ?  WITHOUT EVER ASKING ME WHAT HAPPENED ? 
 If they come and broach this subject I feel like I could go either way. I know I need to keep my cool and tell them this is inappropriate and none of their business otherwise I will be playing into my parents hand. I feel like after this we dont need to talk again either. 

Yall I cannot even. I'm done with this shit."
797,"I just married my husband the other weekend. He’s a wonderfully imperfect human, just like me. He has a younger brother, parents who divorced around age 5 or 6, and was largely raised by his mom spending holidays and school breaks with his dad.  This is just some background.











His mom has rubbed me the wrong way for a long time. It started out okay but I felt the attachment to a nearly 40 year old son was off-putting. She lives a state away and visits 1-2 times a year, Christmases usually are spent traveling to her. I believe her love language is gift giving because she purchases a lot of weird shit for me stating she has always wanted a daughter but never asks what I want. I end up donating a lot of it. She is new age, into metaphysics, conspiracy theories, and once stated to me vaccines cause Autism. I shut the last comment down letting her know many studies have proven otherwise. She has sent conspiratorial weird articles to me via email and I have responded with facts. I don’t get those articles anymore. I do try to my respectful of other’s beliefs. That’s their business, not mine. I’m nonreligious and just try to be a good person as best I can.










When she has come to visit she has taken over our shared living space. We live with my BIL, my best friend who is dating BIL, myself and my husband. She makes comments, replaced a rug while I was at work assuming it was mine (it wasn’t), hounds her sons into doing chores and things around the house, tried to see what was going on with our washing machine and broke it, just- it goes on and on. Bottom line is she is incredibly overbearing and her sons adapted by either ignoring her or just doing what she wanted so the incessant requests and questions would stop. She has been referred to as a smother by my husband so he knows she’s ridiculous at times but has done nothing to stop it. 









The last visit she really pissed off the entire house, BIL was up on the roof cleaning gutters and she broke the washing machine. It was a real pain in the ass. I have largely just done my best to put a smile on my face and discuss these issues behind closed doors with my now husband. There have been fights and arguments. He has stated he and his brother are all his mother has (false, she has a husband who loves her and she is taking care of due to a long term illness). I have said that is ridiculous and he has no obligation to her. I am empathetic to caregiver burnout, I welcome her visits so she can spend time with her sons and have a change of pace but she never stops. She never stops talking; moving; she cannot relax. But this isn’t the point. This is just more of the same that drives me up the wall. She has made comments about our dogs, home, etc. I combatted these visits by coming up with a list of activities going on in the local area that she might enjoy attending with her sons. That helped a little. 












Anyway. Wedding comes up. All of her siblings are attending. She starts treating it like a family reunion. We rented a big house where parents, wedding party, and husband and I are staying. She invites siblings over without asking. She has RV trouble and asks to stay through Monday as the RV needs to get repaired when we asked everyone to leave Sunday so husband and I could do newly wed things in privacy. Privacy we don’t get at home because we live with roommates. We initially agree because we feel put on the spot. It just keeps escalating. She isn’t helping much at all. This is a largely DIY wedding and it’s all hands on deck/many hands make light work. 












Cue a few drinks later and I ask to speak to her in private. I explain how this isn’t her family reunion, it is lovely they get to see one another but this is about husband and I. I ask she respect that. I explain her sons cannot say no to her. I explain I need them to leave Sunday because I bought sexy lingerie and want to use it uninterrupted. We agree her siblings can come over well after the rehearsal dinner, she agrees to leave Sunday, etc. Well, best laid plans, my husband miscommunicated and told his aunts and uncles to come by at 6:30. I was drunk. I tried to be gracious. I show aunts our wedding rings and invited them over later to party if they wanted. They said “no no, they didn’t want to intrude” (record scratch. Wut.)










Anyway, MIL says “sorry” in the most flat-affect way but also looks truly sorry. I don’t know. I said “no worries” and tried to go on. Now, I had quite a bit to drink because I do that sometimes and it was a celebration, emotions are high, it’s high stress anyway, excuses excuses. It wasn’t my finest moment but (from memory) I pull my husband into the room and ask him “wtf” and demand his mom join us. In the meantime I text my mom asking for help. My mom is very JY and doesn’t always take my side because she is a reasonable human being. Anyway....it escalates into yelling. I tell my MIL I feel like I am being gaslighted and why the fuck would her siblings say the same thing when they CLEARLY do not care about intruding AT ALL. They come in like a 3-ring circus. Husband interjects and shared it was his fault. I explode because he cannot say no to his mother and I can’t do this anymore. 













It’s all a bit fuzzy. I was enraged. I recall shaking I was so angry. My husband and I have been together for 5 years now. This isn’t new. I feel this should have been addressed a long ass time ago but he was just too in the FOG. Husband and I end up going downstairs to talk to his mom and stepdad. His mom said she couldn’t believe I would say she is gaslighting me and how she has never cried so hard and I apologize because it sucks. She apologized, too. Sorta. I don’t totally remember. I just recall how awful it all felt. It marred our wedding. We all went on and did our best. She didn’t help much at all and she left first with stepdad on Sunday morning. She said she was ready to leave that night but stepdad wouldn’t let her. (He’s very JY). 












Anyway, I can’t shake these guilty feelings. We all played nice and the wedding was lovely but what a complete nightmare. If anything needs clarification please let me know. I wish I had kept my composure. I wish I hadn’t lost it. It’s weighing heavily on me. I even went to their (MIL and JYSFIL) room at 6 am in the morning and she said it was in the past, she loves me, etc. I feel spineless and irrational. My husband agrees it should have been addressed a long time ago, but I also know he bends when he just wants to placate. He has stated it is he and I now and that he will stand up in the future but I have my doubts. None of this has been a deal-breaker, obviously, as we got married. I wish I’d grown a spine a long time ago and not been such a people pleaser with his mom but here I am. Am I crazy? Am I he JustNo? What can I do in the future so this doesn’t happen again? I have ugliness in my heart and I need advice. 





Side-note: my mom was excellent. She put me in my place, let my MIL know she needs to back off because it’s husband and I now, etc. she really helped because I wasn’t capable of being reasonable anymore because I was so over it. My mom has suggested I just let it go but I struggle with guilt, anxiety, and depression. This is just making me angry and sad."
798,"I have a history of getting like this when I deal with rude people (and not sure if I’m alone there?). I learned to stand up for myself because something nasty someone said to me will still bother me 6 months later if I don’t. I’m in the beginning stages of no more benefit of the doubt with MIL and beginning to stand up to her, so not yet reaping the benefits. 

My husband’s step mum is rude. Every time I’ve seen her she has said something so fucking RUDE. It’s not huge and it’s not like I’ve never dealt with worse. But it is getting to me now. I know based on using this subreddit I am justified in being upset and reading other posts others understand the frustration even more. But I really want to stop being so pissed off. We hardly even see this woman. Nobody told me to be pissed off all the time of course! But I’m saying, that’s how I’m getting. 

Her telling us nobody cooks as good as her, her accusing me of tracing my art (I do art work and she apparently doesn’t believe I can do it on my own... even when I have showed her a video from start to finish!!!!) her saying because I am x nationality that I only eat x nationality’s food and nothing else (prejudiced much?) and sit us down at her laptop showing us recipes like I don’t know how to cook. Oh btw we are in our mid 30’s, I’ve lived on my own for 10 years, most of it alone and I’ve been married before. Not my first rodeo. Not respecting our choice to not have children and constantly bring up “when we have kids/mouths to feed” in the same conversation. Just always treating us like we are kids who don’t know how to make adult decisions, talking about money topics which are none of her business. 

That feels better writing it out. I’ve written this stuff here before. But my god I don’t want to be pissed all the time. I’ve already been given great advice which basically is to stand up to her as well as brush her aside. Why can’t I brush her aside? Can others relate? Why is she like poison to my mind? My own mother has told me to forget her, let her yap and to stop RUNNING from her. Like when she gets to me it’s like I’m running from her, showing her by my reaction (showing that I am registering what she is saying and explaining myself) that I am running, and so she will keep chasing. I think I feel like I have to remedy the issue because in my mind letting her talk will mean she will infiltrate our lives in some way, even though my husband has always been in agreement with me even if he doesn’t always see it as such a big deal, and tells me to just let her say what she will say and ignore it because we will do what we want anyway.

Anyway, just want to post even though I am answering my own issue at this point. It really does feel good to get it out there. Thanks for listening."
799,"So this has been going on for quite sometime, but recently a few comments have been made by my MIL (she still needs a name) that make me think this will need to be re-addressed again with her before we start having kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: My MIL is the type that has talked about grandkids even when DH and I just started dating. She knew we weren't planning on having kids for a while let alone not before we were even married or engaged. Anyways, so she talked about it on and off for a while. Before we were even engaged, DH and I had the conversation that our kids will never be allowed to stay overnight with her. He ended up telling her this to sort of shut her up regarding comments along the lines of ""Oh I can't wait to have my grandbabies over to spend the night!"" She got SO UPSET. We have our reasons. If you remember from my previous posts, DH did not have a good home life. I won't go into details in this post but it is a situation that we don't want our future kids around and we ourselves don't like to be around. We don't trust people in this household to ""behave"" long enough to keep our child. She got mad because she does keep other people's children on a regular basis (not my problem, probably the majority of these people don't know the exact situation going on in the house and I know some of them do know but they just don't care or it doesn't bother them-it's not my place to make that decision for their children). She has stated we are too harsh and she won't be kept from her grandkids. DH said we would still bring them over but they would not be staying the night  or go unsupervised without us there to monitor the situation. Well the subject doesn't come back up. We get engaged and married and over the past few months shes been making the same old comments again about keeping her future grandkids. I talked to my DH again this week and he thinks maybe shes referring to his sibling (who also doesn't currently have kids and is unmarried). Should I let this go or press DH to talk to her again to make sure she understands that unless circumstances change DRASTICALLY that nothing will change? We don't plan on having kids in the near future (probably a good 3-4 years down the road) but it makes me scared to even have kids if this is going to be a constant battle. I already have so many issues with her and I know it will just get worse once kids get here. I am never sure when to push issues and when to just let things go (I am trying to find that line between standing up for myself and according to DH ""making mountains out of molehills""). He thinks we shouldn't have that conversation with her again until we are pregnant and she tries to bring the issue up again. What do you all think?"
800,"I've had a lot of problems with MIL after she realized I wasn't going to bow down and obey her every whim. One of the many times being of which was my ""wedding"" which never happened because of her. Long story short, SO and I wanted to get paper married because he gets benefits/bonuses, and we would work out details for the wedding to have it the next year (this was in 2018).

MIL starts a huge fight right before we are supposed to fly out to them with my parents. Says ""Are you sure she's ready to be married?"" to SO and she gets mad at SO for not keeping that a secret from me and then proceeds to blame me that she ""can't talk privately"" to her son. SO and I share everything and keep nothing a secret which makes her upset for some reason. Anyways, it escalates when she calls me ""emotional"" and ""hormonal"" and this all happened right after my dog of 15 years passed away and I was unable to be with her in her final days. Upset SO yells at her and hangs up which at this point we don't want to fly out anymore and are thinking of getting married in my parents state instead. She calls back and plays her pity me card and how ""sorry"" she is etc. We eventually forgave her.

We still go out and I get to see my parents who I haven't seen in a year. MIL shoves a wedding list in front of SO that was 100+ people MIL wanted to come, we wanted 50 guests (I'm an introvert and have a super small family and friends list). We told her that anyone extra she wanted she would have to pay for and saying she threw a tantrum is an understatement. She proceeded to say ""Brides parents pay for the wedding! Grooms parents pay for the alcohol!"" All in front of my parents. I flat out told her I'm not going to waste 15,000 on one day and she's going to have to deal with it. She started pouting and wouldn't give up until months later.

When we got paper married MIL proceeded to shove her camera in our face while we were filling out sensitive information and distracting the clerk from finishing the papers. This was all super early and we never saw 1 photo of MILs, only ones I have are from my mom who took some with her phone. The rest of the time we were there MIL only sat on her phone in the corner and ignored us.

After we left MIL would bug SO nonstop about the wedding. FIL had an awesome idea we liked about taking hot balloon pictures which would just be SO and me. MIL hates heights and proceeded to say my mom hates heights and that was a dumb idea etc. Poor FIL got so upset he never offered another suggestion to us. When we told MIL we wanted to have a bbq and to just have some blessings said over us, she threw a fit hung up the phone and wouldn't talk so SO for 3 weeks then blaming SO for not calling her. SO told her we needed to decide on the wedding but MIL wouldn't listen and kept bugging poor SO (only time MIL talks to me is when she's fighting with SO).

Eventually we gave up on a wedding and just told our families we got married maybe to have a party but wasn't sure when that would be. Thanksgiving day MIL called SO throughout the whole day telling SO to call his family and let them know we got married in a nasty tone. Dec, MIL then never sent anything for my bday (I would have been happy just getting a card or text) and proceeded to ignore me unless it was to tell me what to do. Example: How we should go out for our first anniversary and how she knows best.

Every time she saw me in person she would ask if I was pregnant, which was very upsetting because it was very hard for me to at the time and it was just a constant reminder.  I'm now 13 weeks pregnant with my first and super scared to tell MIL because all she does is tell me what to do and when I'm blunt and honest she runs and cries to SO that I'm mean. The last time MIL came out to see us she said ""When you have kids you will get so sick of me because I will be over all the time!"" As if that was a good thing... I'm very thankful we are not in the same state and can't go anywhere super far because we have 2 dogs. However I know after SO tells MIL for her bday this month, I'm going to be bombarded with messages and constantly told what to do. MIL will pull the whole ""pity me"" card again because we are telling her way later than my parents (because I needed my moms support and help). SO is very supportive and told me he will handle it and lay down some rules for her. I think she's not going to take SO seriously and I don't want any more drama or infighting to happen (which with her happens a lot). 

Edit: Thank you all for your support and suggestions, we decided to tell MIL a week later as it would seem like the baby would be her bday ""gift"" and we absolutely don't want that.  If we waited any longer it would be much worse but then this way SO can shove an updated pic at her and keep her satisfied for the time being."
801,"Wellll I’m scared it’s starting. Me and SO have been dating about a year at this point. Yes yes we’re are sappy and in love and it’s great, I absolutely love him, one of the only things that I stress about is well.... his family.(both minors btw.... idk if that’s allowed) 

He comes from a more conservative family than I did, where his sisters (16 months and 4 years younger) aren’t allowed the freedom and independence he is because they’re girls. His father is also very old fashioned, he insists the family go to church every weekend even though they all (Mil included) don’t take to going well.

I can be quite a liberal person and have (in my opinion) a very modern view of the world, they don’t like this about me. For example, SOs youngest sister ( 13) had never ever gotten her makeup done before so I offered to do it one night just for fun, some bonding time. (She’s a super super sweet girl love her to bits) so I did her makeup and she was so so so happy, made me heart all warm.  First thing Fil says ... “it’s way too over the top, no teenage girl should wear that much makeup”
...... guys I swear it was a toned down look, not only that but it immediately brought down my, SOs and sisters moods.

Other than that I generally get very negative vibes from them... you know when you just KNOW someone doesn’t like you, but for the most part they hold their tongue I guess. Now here’s why I’m upset.

I’ve stayed over for dinner at their house a couple of times, always at their request. Maybe 6 -8 times I’d say. SO has been over to mine to eat as well, never been an issue for my mam or family. Now I was over at their house with SO, studying in their dining room, when Mil came in and asked him to come next door so they could talk.... (about 30 minutes before they were going to start cooking) 

I could hear her shouting through the walls about how this was “family dinner” and I wasn’t their child, I wasn’t part of their family and I shouldn’t be in their house. I needed to go home. I immediately wanted to cry, I had already been scared that they didn’t like me. (I always wanted that coool relationship with my mil, someone I could have a laugh with) 

I sat their and listened to the rant for a while before I packed my stuff up, when SO came back in he kept saying how sorry he was but I told him I had to go home. Mil came in 2 seconds later, sweet as can be and asked if I wanted to stay for dinner, I politely declined and off I went. This was a few weeks ago and since then I’ve been trying to be in the house as little as possible ..... just feeling down :(((


EDIT: had to fix ages cause I’m silly"
802,"I won BEC bingo (ok, so it was more like a scattergories list) and FH had to buy my crunchy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. Delicious.

1. Heavy perfume. She knows perfumes and potpourri bother me, and give me migraines. So she wafted in, drenched with Elizabeth Arden and carrying a big bag of 

2. Unsolicited gifts. 8 outfits/pajama sets that also reek of her perfume. I thanked her and stood outside on the deck to admire them. This annoyed her. I don't care. I then followed her around, opening windows and turning fans to blast her perfume directly outside. She didn't like this. Well, I don't like migraines, so suck it. 

3. Bringing a food item and not shutting up about how ""fabulous"" it is; 4. Bitching about the heat (she KNOWS we don't have a/c but still came on the hottest day of the year); 5. Bitched about the kittens; 6. Church...

Blah blah blah I won by 2 points. She didn't mention FIL, which was on FH's list.

She hadn't planned on staying, as when she called the hotel, the biggest suite was unavailable. She *has* to have the big suite. But a radiator hose broke in her car after dinner so she had to stay until FH could get a replacement and fix it the next day. She doesn't stay at our house, because it's too old and dangerous/ I said no. That morning he picked up the part and brought her to our house (luckily the  engine had been billowing steam and she had the sense to come back to our house before she broke down in our driveway). So while FH fixed the car, she sat in the house with LO and I and she hurt my brain.  

""I didn't get the big suite. So unfair. They have it booked out for over a month! Can you believe that?""

(I worked at a 4 star hotel for 8 years, 5 as night audit/front desk) ""That's actually great for the hotel. The big rooms are the best money makers. We only have 1 hotel, and it's mostly used for weddings, funerals, and birthday slumber parties. The suites don't usually sell in little hotels, and it's not like we're booming with tourists.""

""But for a month? Don't you think that's ridiculous? It can't be good for the hotel to sell the biggest room for an extended time like that.""

""Well, if the guy wants to pay for it--""

""But he's not!"" She was quite irritated. ""Its an insurance company paying for the room!""

Then it came out. 2 or 3 weeks ago, there was a freak accident in a nearby village and a man's house was all but destroyed by a 3rd party. So he's being put up in my town's hotel until his house is rebuilt,  paid for by the insurance company or the 3rd party. I have no idea how she found this out. I assume she either hounded the desk agent until they couldn't take it anymore, or maybe she found the guy during continental breakfast, I don't know. 

I stared at her. I've driven past the ruins of this house on my way to visit my sister. It's a nightmare. He was *in* his house when this happened and practically got sucked out of it! ""So this man has his house knocked down, and you would begrudge him a nice hotel room just because you want it?""

""Well I just don't see why they'd give him the biggest room.""

""BECAUSE HIS HOUSE WAS DESTROYED!"" This woman is constantly prattling about how we need to go to church and find jesus and share god's love and Holy Holy church church church and she can't understand why a man who's lost his house in a freak accident should get the big hotel room? Are you fucking serious?! ""He has to live in a hotel for over a month, and you don't think he should get the big room? The company whose fault this is will happily pay out the nose to keep him from suing them for every last dime, the least they can do is foot the bill for the biggest room! You complain about feeling cramped in a regular room for ONE NIGHT but don't think he'd go absolutely nuts for weeks on end? That's the most selfish thing I've ever heard! He deserves the biggest room! He deserves the entire floor to himself! HE LOST HIS GODDAMN HOUSE!""

""Well I just don't think it's fair for other people who might want it.""

""The only thing that isn't fair about this is that he *deserves* to be sent in the other direction to [city] to stay in their brand new fancy 5 star hotel. Our little rinkydink hotel is smart giving him the best room and charging the company for it. Good for them, and doubly good for him. I hope they're also sending him complimentary hookers and cocaine.""

FH finished the car and she hurriedly made her exit. I was still fuming after she left. He just grinned at me. ""She told you about the hotel, didn't she? She was complaining to me and I told her I didn't want to hear about it. Just one more example of her shining with the light of Christian generosity and love."" Then he went outside for a cigarette."
803,"We have been LC with MIL and essentially NC with SIL for almost a month. MIL contacted SO to request his presence at a family meeting (which I am not permitted to attend) to ""mediate"" problems between GC SIL and SO (stemming from a verbal attack by SIL on SO and accusations of him being 'cold' and 'distant' toward SIL's partner).

The problem here is that in the past MIL has jumped in to defend SIL and insulted SO (I'm sure I've written about it before). When SO expressed concern that MIL was going to repeat this, she denied having called him the derogatory name and insulting his mental capacity.

In the conversation, MIL disregarded some/most of SO's concerns as ""someone has been whispering in your ear"" (implying that I was manipulating him-- which she said the last time they argued, that I was ""poisoning SO against them"" and ""has got too much to say"")... She then had the audacity to say that she respects me the same way as BIL (which doesn't ring true as he is treated to special treatment by them and they seem to go the extra mile to be chummy with him and get him special foods he likes-- I'm not sure if I'm reading that unfairly, but it definitely seems that way, and I wonder if it is because he is from the same cultural and linguistic heritage).

SO became upset with me for expressing that I didn't appreciate the duplicity from his mother, or the implied accusations- he believed I was ""making it about myself"".

I'm at a loss here, SO has agreed to go to this circus of a ""family meeting"", which I know is going to end up with him being hurt even more and his family ganging up on him. It is always the way, even though MIL assured him that she wouldn't (but in the same breath said she was going to air grievances from the past).

I can't stop SO going, but I'm concerned about the impact that it will have on him (he has just left a toxic workplace) and ultimately our relationship, which has improved significantly since we disentangled and his work issues began to resolve.

I am also very hurt by MILs comments and also her treatment of her own son as though he exists for her happiness.

Any advice... or observations?"
804,"TW: abuse, homophobia/transphobia

Only going to mention the above briefly but wanted to make sure my bases were covered. ❤️

Hi folks, long time lurker but first time poster. It’s been about two months since I cut contact with my JNMom. She’s been manipulative and narcissistic my entire life, and used heavy guilt tactics right up until I went NC. I got extremely tired of ignoring the very racist, homophobic, transphobic, and political (read: liberal hate) comments that would happen in every single interaction. I called her out on it and she didn’t acknowledge any of the hurt and kept saying “we grew up in different times”, “we can have differing opinions”, the usual.

The final straw for me was her telling me to hide any kind of pride, stop talking about, and to essentially just ‘stop’ being bisexual (I dislike labels, I’m actually queer, but the point still stands) for my D[ear]H’s sake after years of going into a complete tantrum any time I mentioned anything related to my orientation. Edit: it’s irrelevant to this really, but my DH is wholeheartedly supportive and is an amazing ally, eager to attend pride events with me and everything.

But... ever since I cut contact I still miss her every single day. A very close relative was diagnosed with cancer recently and all I want to do is go home and hug my mom, even after all of the emotional abuse I endured. I have a great set of in-laws who I love dearly, but I still can’t shake the pain and hole I feel inside without my mom.

I really don’t know what to do. I so desperately want to reach out again and try with her, but I don’t even know if I can do so, and openly acknowledge it probably is not the best idea. I find myself questioning all of our interactions and whether everything was really “that bad”."
805,"Edit: okay, yes, we all agree I am a big dummy pushover, but this is literally the first time I've spent any extended period with this woman, and I was not prepared for the crazy! I'll know for next time (if there ever is one, and I doubt there will be) what I'm in for. 

I got married! I posted before about a few unpleasant MIL issues before the wedding and HOOO BOY was I right that she was going to be a complete pill. I really tried not to let it ruin the wedding and vacation, but I honestly did let it get to me and I'm pretty bitter about how a lot of it turned out. 


We were overseas for two weeks, a week and some change of which was with MIL and her fiance. I had brought a journal with me to write down all the details of our ""fairytale adventure!"" but I'm really sad to look back through it as just... a long list of MIL screwing things up. I'll have to pick and choose a few of the more unsavory memories because it was just.. Literally every second she was around was like pulling teeth. She HATED every moment of the vacation and had to have every ounce of attention on her or she would pout. My parents are definitely not her biggest fans. I'm wrote down my full bullet point list and posted it on my profile if anyone wants to read the whole, HUGE thing. https://www.reddit.com/user/togostarman/comments/dfrf99/the_bullet_point_list_of_my_mil_during_my_wedding/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share



She whined the ENTIRE TIME. She absolutely hated the traveling; the food; walking; sometimes even just talking lol. 


She CONSTANTLY put down DH and I, AND MY MOM (who paid for her to go!) 


She was such a pill to ride with in the car because of her negative attitude, that my family got in a huge fight over who would have to ride in the rental car with her (we had two cars.) 

 
She brought her deceased husband's ashes and threatened to scatter them at the wedding. Wound up not scattering them anywhere, and just passed them off to DH who BEGGED her not to bring them in the first place, and left it up to him to scatter them immediately post wedding


She called DH and I stupid alot, especially insulting DH's financial choices as if she had in business in what he did with his money AT ALL. 


She developed a weird fixation on my 8 year old sister and starting ""parenting"" her, trying to get her to do what she told her to do instead of what my parents told her to do, and also tried to stop her from using the bathroom (she was just the bathroom police of the trip in general. She hated anyone using the bathroom.) 


She was mean to her own fiance which made things pretty awkward 


A few times she even refused to get out of the car to look at things we were traveling to see, because she thought they were dumb and only wanted to learn (in her actual words) ""stuff about our [the US's] own history."" LOL


She tried to force me to let her help me take a shit in my wedding dress. 


She didn't help pay for anything she told us she'd go halfsies on


She did many more annoying things, but it was her overwhelmingly negative attitude that put the whole family on edge and made things miserable. I have NEVER talked to someone who can see the downside to absolutely everything. She picked fights for no reason. She complained CONSTANTLY, and she was mean. A huge cloud hung over all of us the whole time she was there. Ugh. 


Oh well. I'm married now and it was beautiful despite the shenanigans. We're VVVVVLow contact with her the rest of the time, so I guess it's all fine. "
806,"You can read my other posts about my flip floping mil between being a jymil to a jnomil. 
I'm posting here because i have an upcoming visit with the Fil and mil, our choice. 
But im looking for non- rude tactics to deal with her that I will be ready to say, act if she does her jnomil behavior. 

Examples but not exclusively these things:

- request that we consider her and fil when making arrangements with other family because they want to see us more. 

- make comments on how to get infant to sleep thru night (mil mentioned we should sleep train before) or other comments around child development related to grandchild

- ""suggests"" how to do things better around the house ...for efficiency she says

And just in general I want to send her a message that I'm not entertaining her requests and passive aggressiveness."
807,"TW: loss of family member

Hello everyone, it's been a while but I wanted to check in. This week has been hell. 

A few weeks ago my FIL started to get sick. DH and I suspected lung cancer because FIL has smoked for 60 years, but we waited for the doctors to come to that conclusion. He's been in and out of the hospital a couple times and they misdiagnosed him with everything from pneumonia to liver disease. (Side note: I've never had any problem directly with FIL. He was DH's favorite parent because he was never mean, he just enabled her. I don't bear him any ill will. Honestly I don't really feel much of anything for him.) 

In the midst of this ongoing medical crisis, Murky Dismal decides to switch personalities. In my DH's words: ""my whole life she's been a controlling, manipulative bitch. But now that dad's life is on the line, NOW she decides to move to the backseat."" Which means that for all of FIL's doctor appointments, tests, procedures, DH has to drive 2 hours each way to be there, because MIL suddenly forgot how to be a responsible adult. His brother (the GC) who still lives at home, was also unable to handle anything. DH had to schedule visits, ask all the questions, call for test results, ALL OF IT, and then report back to them.

This past weekend FIL was back in the hospital so we hurriedly packed (so hurriedly I forgot a lot of essentials) and headed out there. I should mention that I am not allowed at their house unsupervised (no idea why) and we didn't want the kids stuck at the hospital, so we got a hotel room nearby. We had only brought one vehicle so I was trapped at the hotel while DH was with his parents and brother.

I will let you use your imagination regarding how much fun it was spending 3 days in a hotel room with 2 large, hyper children, living off whatever food we can get delivered, while DH is totally unreachable. We visited the pool a lot. At one point my credit card got frozen for ""unusual activity."" Super fun.

At the end of day 3, I found out that FIL had passed away. DH was in shock, it all happened very fast. We got some wine and toasted to FIL. The next morning after breakfast we told the kids, they were devastated. But the silver lining was that we get to leave the hotel. (Yes I know that sounds cold.) We pack up and get in the car... to go stay at their house.

I was trying SO HARD to be the good, supportive wife. But they make it so hard. I offered to call relatives or do anything to make myself useful. Nah. I got scolded for sitting in FIL's chair at the kitchen table. So I tried to stay out of everybody's way. Doing my best to keep the kids occupied. They're bored and stressed and tired, which is just the perfect storm when there's nowhere to escape to. Also BIL keeps the house so damn hot, it was 70 degrees and he turned the heat on. I got in trouble for opening a window in the spare room where the kids and I were hanging out. 

MIL is milking this for all it's worth. She claims she doesn't want attention, but you wouldn't know it. For example, she doesn't want her sisters at the funeral, so she was talking to the funeral directors about throwing out uninvited guests. She's also considering suing the hospital.

Anyway, the reason I had to post tonight is because we're leaving first thing in the morning to go back. We really only came home to get clean clothes. The funeral is in a few days and DH wants to stay the weekend. I offered to stay home but he wants us all together. I'm trying to brace myself. I'm letting the kids take their tablets and pretty much anything else they want to keep themselves happy. I have a full bottle of xanax. Wish me luck."
808,"Hello friends! it’s me again. I decided to share with you all, in small installments, what the past two years have been like with MitM. No advice needed, old story but feel free to tell me what you think! FIRST SOME BACK STORY.  I’ll start by saying that DH &amp; I have been together for 6 years. She was MAYBE JNMIL until DH left for basic training. So that dear readers is where our story begins. 

She had a surgery right before he left, about a month before. I’m pretty sure it was a lap band surgery? Not too sure. It was one that made her smaller and lose weight. This surgery will be an excuse for her behavior for atleast a year to come. I won’t go into too much detail but basically it was time for us to leave for his graduation, i was gonna drive myself and folllow then. I go to their house the day before to hash out details and I find MitM in an awful state. Apparently either something went wrong with the surgery or she doesn’t do well with anesthesia or something. The details here are fuzzy here because no one ever really explained what happened?? (if you have heard of something similar let me know) But she was OUT of it. Super sick. Could barely walk. Her mind was a mess, super short term memory. She didn’t know where FDH was or where we were going or why. Her brain was mush y’all. I cant even describe how bad. She needed help doing pretty much anything. So whatever happened to her must have been bad because the surgery was 3 months ago. So FSFIL didnt know if she could be in a car for 9hrs. They ended up going but he asked me to ride with them bc it would be easier on him with her and the two young boys. I said okay and off we go. The trip was fine except her talking about being in the room when I give birth to our future children. 

Now nothing terrible happened for a while after this. ***BUT THE IMPORTANT PART HERE IS HER SURGERY AND HOW IT “MESSED HER UP”. IT WILL BE A HUGE PART IN ALL OF OUR LIVES FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF.*** 

On to the real story here. We fast forward to atleast 7 months before the wedding. Me and DH paid for a large majority of our wedding. My JYmom and dad paid for quite a bit too. JYFIL gave us $$ for our honeymoon. We asked MitM &amp; Sfil to pay for the rehearsal dinner. They agreed. 

Now we we’re getting married on a Friday (because cheaper, duh!!) at a venue 2 hours away from our home town. We wanted the rehearsal to happen thursday at the venue so we could actually practice the timing with the music. It was very important to me because it was one continuous song that the parents of bride and groom, the bridal party and I were all walking to with a very specific part for my time down the aisle. So I wanted to practice with everyone there, in the venue!  It was $500 to rent it the night before the wedding for the rehearsal. Now I know that’s kinda steep. But the bright side here is that we would be able to decorate the night before and not worry about it the day of the wedding! We don’t want them to spend too much so we offer that they could have something cheap cater, like CFA. They agree and say that works! Give them some time to get the money for it. 

Time goes bye. I mention it to DH that we need to check on the progress of the rehearsal . He mentions it to MitM and she proceeds to tell him that “it was too expensive to rent the venue and so were having the reception at X restaurant instead”.  Now I don’t mean to sound ungrateful but... I thought we agreed on a plan already? And if it wouldn’t work out... shouldn’t you have told us sooner? And included us on where it will take place?  Am I wrong for thinking that? Let me know. 

I was upset about not having the venue and my mom agreed to pay for the venue the night before. She calls to book it and it turns out the couple who is getting married there that Saturday rented the venue on Thursday for their rehearsal. So now we really couldn’t rehearse there before we got married. I was really upset about it but DH made me feel better &amp; we settled on the fact that we could just practice at the restaurant after dinner. Not the same, but atleast we practice. 

Anywho. A month before the wedding MitM asks me about a head count for dinner. We go back and fourth on the number for a bit. She’s saying the dinner will be 40+ people?? Dh &amp; I made a list of 20 people.  So here’s where it gets interesting. This is the conversation we had via text. 

MITM- “are we including out of town guests? it’s tradition for our of town guests and bridal party” 

OP-“i don’t have any out of town guest to include that aren’t in the wedding or parents of someone in the wedding” 

Mitm “so no out of town guests only those in your rehearsal is who you want? All of DH’s [extended] family are out of town guests just so we’re on the same page. That’s why the number is 42.” 

(i just want to note that we didn’t invite any extended family on our list for the rehearsal unless the were parents/ guardians of someone in the wedding) 

OP “it is up to you”

MitM “Okay so what about this you and your bridal party and your grandparents can go to [restaurant she picked out for rehearsal dinner] and SFIL and I will choose somewhere else for DH's family to go that's coming out of state and will just eat somewhere else is that what you'd like? The only person of DH’s family that is in y'all's wedding is BIL1 so if that's what we need to do I'll need to know so that I can divide everyone up.”

OP “why would we divide up? BIL2 and BIL3 are in the wedding too...?”

MitM “you just told me that only the bridal party will be involved in the rehearsal dinner so I'm trying to figure out because I have people coming from different states . That I need to accommodate I cannot just let them hang out to dry. So you only want BIL1 BIL2 and BIL3 and everyone else can go somewhere else is that right”

OP “no i never said that. i said it was up to you. “

MitM “all I need to know do you want everybody at [restaurant she picked out] or do you want me to take our out-of-town family somewhere else. all you want there is the bridal party is that correct?”

OP “i said i don't have any out of town guest that i would invite from my family. you guys are the ones paying for it so it is completely up to you. “

MitM” What are BIl2 and BIL3 doing?”

OP “BIL2 is the ring bearer and BIL3 is walking with the flower girl. i never said i wanted it to just be the bridal party. DH and i want everyone to be together.”

MitM “That's not what you said you said your bridal party and I'm supposed to take all the out-of-town guests somewhere else if that's what you want I'm staying with my out-of-town guests they have come to see you I'm not going to separate my family. So can everybody attend the [restaurant she picked out]  with you it's going to be 48 people”

OP “i never asked you to separate your family. i have said multiple times that who is invited to the dinner is up to you. as you are the one paying for it. we never wanted anyone to be separated. we're getting married. the joining of two families. we should be together.”

MitM “okay you may have said it multiple times but I have also expressed to you and DH I am not mentally ready for this responsibility I am trying to take it on at the best way I can. again this surgery screwed me up to the point where I was ready just to commit suicide. I'm just now dusting myself off and I am trying to take responsibility and make your wedding the best thing that I possibly can. This is what we are going to do.. SFIL an I will strictly pay for the bridal party know extra parents know extra grandparents. My family that is coming from out of town SFIL and I BIL2 and BIL3. Will eat somewhere else. “

OP “That is not what we want. We want everyone to be together.”

MitM “ i gave your mom the total count 48 and she couldn’t believe it. no i’m mistaken it’s 52. I just want what’s best for you and DH”

OP “okay. DH and i agree we would love to have everyone together. there is no reason to be apart. It does seem like a lot of people. but we just want everyone to be happy. WE will not be happy if everyone is divided and making us feel like we have to choose sides. DH and I never wanted you to spend a ridiculous amount on this dinner. that's originally why we chose something that was cheaper like CFA because we knew it would be a lot of people.”

MitM “ okay then i will call them give them the final number and see what they say. I am so glad we're on the same page I did not want to have to divide us. I don't want to fight with you baby girl I love you more than life itself... I can look around and do some investigating to see if there's some cheaper restaurants that we can utilize. I think that some of our issue is just simply communication”

how is our problem communication?! I communicated exactly what i meant while she just made up her own version of how things went. (young naive me should’ve realized this would happen for the rest of my life dealing with her) 

and then she proceeded to send me other possible restaurants. We are less than 1 month from the wedding at this point. I shut that down real quick.  We ended up practicing at the restaurant after dinner. But MitM was sure to leave with Sfil, BIL1 and BIL2 before we practiced, even though i mentioned how important it was to me. 

I also wanna point out that she begged to be apart of our wedding planning and them claims that “it was all too much” because of her surgery. But because she wouldn’t stop being upset that she wasn’t involved enough we let her be in charge of the grooms cake. But that’s a whole another story for another day."
809,"New to this but felt the need to get this story off my chest as I haven't really shared it. I have a few of these but this is probably the worst IMO. MIL has never liked me and has made it abundantly clear, even going as far as trying to stop/sabotage our wedding the week before and day of.

A few years back my wife and I were going through a struggle with infertility (happy note, we adopted our first daughter after 7 years of infertility and now almost 10 years after the infertility diagnosis SO is due with our next little one this month!)

It wore on us, MIL made it worse by constantly asking inappropriate questions, pushing the subject and generally belittling SO's feelings on the matter. 

During this time SO and I became depressed. When the Dr. Told us we were extremely unlikely to conceive at all it got worse and we both withdrew from everyone, especially SO's family as much as possible due to MIL's shenanigans and constant attempts to wedge us apart. 

MIL is one of those who has to call daily to try and stay on top of everything. When SO stopped answering MIL automatically blamed me, it had to be something I was doing.

Fast forward a few weeks and my SO's aunt invites us to a party at her house with the rest of that family. We went in an attempt to keep up appearances of normal life. Side note, Aunt was known for throwing some real ragers.

About 30 minutes after we got there SO's sloppy drunk uncle comes up to me and grabs my arm roughly and says (see also: slurs) ""we need to go out into the garage and have a little talk""

He then proceeds to threaten me because ""he heard I was laying hands on his niece and harming her."" And said the whole family knew what I was doing. This could not be further from the truth! I was furious and hurt. 

I asked where he heard such an outrageous thing and why would he ever believe that without any reason or indications of it? He clammed up and refused to say where. Upon threat of getting SO involved he admitted that MIL had been telling the family that I just had to be harming SO because she was acting sad and didn't answer her daily calls anymore! The only reason we were invited to the party was because MIL thought I would get my ass beat and maybe SO would blame me and leave.

I told SO and the resulting blow out between her and MIL was of epic proportions. For the record, MIL never apologized for any of this, nor did she clear my name to the family or own her lie. SO and I had to go to everyone individually to clear things up and explain why we had been distant and sad, adding insult to injury. 

The only benefit to any of this is that up to this point SO didn't see how bad MIL was and always made excuses for her etc. That came to an abrupt end.

Thanks for reading this far, it's been a few years but it does feel a little better to have this out."
810,"I quite literally am having a mental breakdown I think. I don’t know if she’s slowly losing touch or something but my god, was I livid. The woman raves about being a doctor, a business owner, and a realtor, yet you don’t know what basic fucking science is? 

Like, holy fuck, it’s a pressurized can with liquid inside and you put it in the goddamn freezer? Could you be anymore out of touch with reality?

God help me."
811,"Trigger Warning - Animal Cruelty (I consider it to be)

My husband and I, we have an 8 weeks old Doberman puppy. We had to leave the city for a week and we asked MIL if she can care for our puppy while we're gone and she agreed. She likes dogs so we left, thinking our dog is in good hands. 

Yesterday we came home and were shocked to find our puppy with his ears taped. MIL had taken him to the vet and had this done, without saying anything to us. And she presented it as a surprise to us, expecting us to be happy. First I almost passed out and then I was ready to strangle her. Who does something like that to a dog that’s not your dog, without asking the owners what do they think about these kinds of things? 

And MIL didn’t understand why are we so upset and angry. She was like ”What? You were going to crop his ears anyway!” 

No, we weren’t! If she called us and asked, we would have told her straight out NO. We’re 100% against cropping dogs’ ears, tails, etc. for aesthetics. If there are medical reasons behind doing that – fine. But if you only do it so that the dog would meet your beauty standards – you’re so cruel and disgusting. I’ve said it and I mean it.

I was so mad and my husband was even angrier. Like, who the hell does she think she is? She was asked to dogsit and that’s it. Who gave her permission to mutilate our dog? Who does shit like that behind owners’ backs?

So when she saw we’re not appreciating her ”efforts” at all, she offended. She whined about the money she spent. Well, nobody asked her to do it and now she’s crying about her own stupidity. MIL was like ”A Doberman without cropped ears and tail is nothing but an overgrown Dachshund. He won’t win any prizes in dog shows with floppy ears and that silly long tail.”

We weren’t going to participate in dogs shows. We don’t need a superstar, we want a sweet and loving family dog. We would have never in a million years changed his appearance in any way, shape or form. He was perfect for us just the way he was. 

Originally we were going to pay her for dogsitting but after this, she’s not getting a single cent and she’s never staying alone with our dog again. If we need a dog sitter again we’ll ask our friends, anyone but MIL. 

We’re going to see our family vet tomorrow to see what we can do about this. Also because MIL’s not saying where did she got it done, hopefully, it wasn’t a run-down market hut that just positioned themselves to be a clinic. I do have some questions for Doberman owners here – is it possible to reverse it? It’s been 4 days since she did it. If we took the tapes off, would his ears return to their natural state? Or is the damage already done and it’s better to let them grow upright? Please share if you have some experience. 

If he’s going to have upright ears – well, there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s just so upsetting that someone made that choice for us, something that we would have never allowed to be done."
812,"Tw; death tw;drugs 

First and foremost, It really may be BEC for real. I dont know if I'm just being far too sensitive given the subject matter behind it all. So if I am, please gently point that out. 

My SO passed in March. It's been super trying for everyone of course. We were together almost everyday. Without going into to many details, my So was very much a justyes. 

Little background on us. It wasnt always perfect.  My so had borderline personality disorder.  And was an ex heroin user.  Or I thought ex heroin user.  He overdosed after being clean for a long time and his mother found him. 

I do want to stress that fil and mil were Absolutely wonderful to me after he passed. No drama. They even mentioned me in the obituary. 

Now onto what the BEC is. Discussing the headstone (which somehow just got ordered????) Mil totally disregarded everything she asked me and has ordered the most over the top, ridiculous thing including putting his face on it. (SO would be pissed. He hated people looking at him) I had suggested something in line with his personality.  Simple but still very much him. 

But the true BEC started Saturday.  I forgot to respond to a text.  Intially, I just had ignored it. Wanted to respond when I was ready. We are in different grieving spots. I'm trying to move on. Not forget him but come to terms with it and pick up the mess my life has become since then. 

She...doesn't leave the house. Wont attend grief support.  Wont do anything but share on the book of faces with woe is me posts. (And ofc I'm not trying to take away her pain. She lost her ducking son. No mother should have that happen.  It's a damn tragedy and horrifying to live through .) But, I cant be dragged into that circle of living.  My so would want me to be happy. Be healthy.  Find myself. So I am. 

She texts me Sunday again with a almost 3 page message of listing how upset she is and that I must hate her. Ends it with a few parting words of but of course she's grateful that I made her son so happy. Hes never been so happy. 

I respond and legit say I am sorry. I didn't mean to make her think I forgot her. I just hadn't felt hot on saturday. And I have been busy as an aunt has cancer and I've been helping my mom deal with taking care of her. And I'm forgetful. I have been very forgetful since SO died. I've been assured its part of the grief. 

So instead of a reply to that she copied and pasted her initial message to me.  I replied as as stated before and said yes I do still want to talk to you of course. 

Nothing after that. 

Now; maybe I am being a little oversensitive  and like above if I am? Please let me know. Maybe it's just my own grief and sadness blinding me."
813,"[Previous thread for backstory](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/cz130w/update_cutting_off_contact_with_deadbeat_mil)

Just for some background, MIL was already hooked on League of Legends and would often leave her young children downstairs unsupervised to make their own food while she gamed upstairs. 

Lately we heard from MILs boyfriend that shes hooked on Runescape now.

We never see her or the kids unless the school asks us to pick them up when MIL doesn't show up, happens more often than we'd like. A few months ago she turned up at our house to collect her kids amd she mentioned to my wife about how she 'wanted to get away from it all and go down south to read a book for a few days'

Travel from Scotland to England to 'read a book' by herself? Okay, a bit weird, Sounded like MIL's having an affair, but okay, not our business.

On Thursday she dropped her kids off at a friends, last minute, with no clothing or toiletries, only the school clothes they were already wearing all week. Said she'd be back Tuesday as she's going down to London. MILs friend had to go out and buy them new clothes and everything.

Forgot to mention, the kids missed a day of school for this. MIL couldn't just wait an extra day until the weekend. Unauthorised absence and they already have 40% attendance...

Anyway, the same weekend MIL went away happened to be during RuneFest 2019, its likely she went there.

MILs friend ended up dropping the kids off at MILs boyfriends just before MIL got back, so she wouldn't have to confront MIL and punch her."
814,"She’s absolutely killing us. I am so grateful for this sub... I am updating like crazy and I hope it’s not too much for everyone.

So, every night in the process of packing up getting ready to move, I always ask MIL questions. The questions have been cancelling our internet (it’s in her name), what she wants to sell, if she needs me to move stuff, and what her permanent housing plan is.

Tonight’s questions were cancelling the cable, what she’s doing with her extra bed frame and what her permanent housing plan is.

She doesn’t care about the cable so I can cancel that. She doesn’t know what to do with her extra bed frame and asked me what I thought she should do. I replied to sell it and she said that maybe, she wasn’t sure. So we have no resolution on that.

As for her permanent housing plan - we have none. She has no damage deposit for another place, she can’t find a place she likes (she doesn’t have the luxury of being picky) and she can’t afford much. She also says she has no idea what she is doing. So I asked her if she needs me to find her a place. And that I could find her a place in a week. She said she is looking at another place tomorrow and that she would know more tomorrow (she keeps saying this). But that she doesn’t have a damage deposit and her move date would be November 1, not October 26 where my family could help us out. I asked her if she is going to stay at her friends place and get a storage unit. She said staying at her friends place isn’t a permanent thing. A few nights would be okay but that’s it.

I told her that she needs a plan and that living in her car isn’t a good idea. I also said that DH and I do care and want to make sure she is safe and has a place to stay. The tears were almost flowing and she said she knew and I’ve been a lot nicer than she expected this whole time. (Because I’m such a bitch all the time basically.) She also said that living in her car for a few nights will be okay and she could manage for a few nights. 

I said you could live at an independent adult living facility for $400 per month and she said it’s more than that. I replied that it’s more if your not telling the truth about what you make in a month. And she said she would rather die than live in an old folks home. I replied that’s what will happen if she lives in her car.

She assured me she will have a plan tomorrow after she sees the other place (but she won’t have a plan - something will be wrong with it). She also thinks the storage facility that she saw a few days ago tried to bill her so I have to call them tomorrow as I don’t think they did. I think it was just a prepay option to avoid paperwork the day of moving.

Regardless, I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do. DH is livid because he thinks her plan is to be homeless and make us feel bad. He thinks she is making this all about her and instead of enjoying our first home buying experience, we are both dreading it entirely. We don’t know what to do. She is making a full pity party and only packs when she is forced to. She comes home and promptly falls asleep on the couch for 3 hours then gets up and sorts out boxes I’ve brought up for her.

I understand this is hard for her and we didn’t give her a ton of notice. The total notice will have been 6 weeks for moving. But that should be more than enough and her pity party is too much. Am I an awful person for causing this because I just want my own place and my own life. The condo we are moving into is a third of the size of our house. She will not and cannot stay there. It wasn’t purposely chosen for that reason, it’s all we could afford to buy.

I just feel like an awful person. And I know DH feels bad too. But we aren’t making these choices for her!"
815,"I’m currently working on finishing my bachelors degree, and I’ve been telling her all along that I’m taking specific pre-med courses to get into medical school. I’m approaching my final year next year (hopefully lol) and I’m starting to make plans to do my MCAT and  feel out different schools so I can get a good idea of where I want to go. 

My mom didn’t think I was serious all this time  apparently and told me “But you aren’t smart enough for med school!!!” 

?????

When I was like “What” she kept going on about how my grades were terrible and I’d never get into med school bc I’ll bomb the MCAT????? that i should have just “been a nurse” ???

I’m not trying to flex but in my entire college career I’ve only gotten 2 B’s. TWO. My GPA is stellar. I’ve got a bunch of experience working as a CNA and a Medical Scribe. I also have a letter of recommendation from a CMO. 

I think if I do well on my MCAT i’ll be fine. But it hurts that my mom is so mean about it. Like damn fine! You think badly of me! And badly of nursing staff who haul ass every day and night and essentially hold hospitals together! I wouldn’t mind nursing but I have a dream and damn if I’m just not gonna go for it. 

I wish my mom was supportive of my dreams. I want to be a Medical Examiner and serve justice. I’m so tired of all this putting me down bullshit. I’m gonna achieve it even if its just to spite her.

EDIT: Gold??? THANK YOU???? I’m crying in the parking lot at school thank you oh my god 😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖

EDIT 2: PLATINUM???? FR???? Y’all now I rlly gotta destroy the MCAT 😂 Whoever is behind this, thank you so much. Thanks everyone for your support, I’m gonna go kick college’s ass just for you guys !!!!!!!"
816,"I didn’t get any responses on r/JustNoSO, so I figured I would try here again. You guys are so helpful. You can scroll to the bolded letters toward the bottom for an update if you read my post yesterday.

——————————

I know how the title may seem catty, but bear with me. MIL lives five minutes away from us (27M, 25F). We see her 1-2 times a week, occasionally more if there’s holidays. This past week, his parents held a little pre-Thanksgiving supper since his uncle was leaving this coming Friday. We ate the supper, chatted after, except I am usually ignored by everyone. We have been married for two years, together for five. At every family supper, his mothers side of the family are always rude. They don’t acknowledge I exist, let alone laugh at my jokes or engage in conversation with me.

SO barely notices it happening so whenever I bring it up, he promises he will be better next time. It doesn’t happen. This past Saturday, I kind of reached my breaking point. Myself and his family took a trip to my home province, which is also his dads home province. His dads side of the family are all wonderful and welcomed me with open arms. We stayed with his dads side of the family for a week before driving across the province to visit my hometown. While we were there, his mother proceeded to call my historic hometown a Hick Town. She offered up my front seat of the car that SO and I rented multiple times to his little cousins or even SO’s brother/father. Normally this wouldn’t bother me since I understand men are bigger, therefore the front seat accommodates them more, but they rented an RV and they can *literally get up and walk around their vehicle.* I paid 700$ for this rental, I don’t want to be squished in between MIL and F/BIL. SO didn’t really stick up for me, he hates confrontation. His last girlfriend was in high school, and they didn’t do much together. He is not experienced enough on *basic relationship etiquette* so I kind of understand why he didn’t want to make a big deal out of these things. But there’s one specific interaction with MIL that irks me. 

While at my grandmothers house, I was showing MIL a big family picture of all my cousins and family. For this story, SO’s exes names will be Ex1 and Ex2. I also have a cousin and a niece with the same names, and I pointed at them and said their names. She laughed and said “Oh, you and SO both have a Ex1 *and* a Ex2!That’s hilarious.” I told SO about this after, and he agreed how disrespectful and out of line it was, but he never said anything to her. I should have, but I was too shocked.

Enough of the backstory of being put in 2nd place, the supper with his family was rough. We were watching the hockey game and his uncles would ask a question about the game, but wouldn’t even glance in my direction when I would say the answer. I have played hockey for 16 years, I know more about the NHL than SO does. SO would say the exact same thing I did and his uncle was satisfied with that answer. It may be some kind of sexist bullshit, but I at least expect SO to speak up after and say “Yes, that’s what OP said!” But he doesn’t want to cause a fuss. It’s wearing on me.

Now, the phone calls. Sorry if this post is all over the place, little tidbits come to my mind. Yesterday, the salt beef finally boiled over. I had enough. The disrespect from his mom and her side of the family finally cracked me. Every day, I have to deal with SO and I’s time being interrupted because MIL has to chat with her grown ass son about how her day was or how her coworkers were getting on her nerves today. Every day it’s a phone call of nothing of importance. SO hates the calls, but he just sits there while she drones on about absolutely nothing. And I sit next to him just waiting for this phone call to be over so we can get back to whatever we were doing. 

**Start reading here if you read my post yesterday.**

After the fight, I tried to reason with him today to talk to his mom and set boundaries with her. For example, this is what he has said he wants, no phone calls after 7pm and only call if it’s an emergency. A text is much easier, and maybe limit to one call a week. They see each other in person 1-2 times a week, she can gossip about whoever during that time. I feel like this is a good compromise? He is a grown man and his mom still hasn’t cut the cord. So we calmly discussed this, and I expressed how hurt it made me feel that I am always put on the back burner and everything is dropped when she calls. 

We agreed that the next time she called, he would lay down the law. 

So she called, and he did not.

She talked and talked for 17 minutes, and I just sat there hoping he would bring up our talking points. I hoped he would put an end to our suffering, but he let me down. I was so hurt, but I feel stupid for even feeling so deeply about this? But it’s too much. I miss my SO, he gets off work at 6 and we are in bed by 9, there’s not much time we get together. And her calls usually take up a third of that time. I grabbed my keys and my dog, ready to leave. He begged and pleaded with me to not leave, but to help him.

He has been so stressed at work and with his new garage being built, and things between us have been super rocky ever since our vacation with the nightmare in laws. I get that, but I am stressed too. I’m stressed that he will never stand up for me or stick it to his mother. I’m scared I wasted all these years on him and I’m scared of a possible divorce.

He wants me to *write out exactly what to say to his mom* when she calls again tomorrow. Something that isn’t mean, but straight to the point. No calls after 7, preferably on his commute home at 5:45. Only call if an emergency, and they can catch up in person.

Maybe I’m asking too much."
817,"The drop by turned into excruciating all day saga....

I want to thank all those for the advice they gave me on my previous post it was all very good and I really wish I could have taken it and done it. We just wanted to get this over with so went ahead.  I'm glad we did b/c it gives me more ammo to maintain DH's shiny spine .  He so just wants to be a good son to his crazy mother.  And I'm just done being nice about her antics.

So we wake up realize LO got their first tooth and is fussy ...great...  but LO is a very happy baby so not the end of the world.  We straighten up the house so it looks presentable even for a 10 minute stop by.  I try to get LO down for a nap...no dice..

DH tries to contact Turditzen to see what her exact plan is instead of this open ended 12-2 thing.  She never responds to any calls/texts.  DH calls FIL who is in another state at work to see what he knows....FIL says she was putting her make up on at 11....  So we go about our day as best we can waiting for her to get here and get this done so we can get other stuff done.  She never calls or texts to say Hey I'm on my way or anything we have no idea what her plan is.  I'm getting more annoyed by the minute. 

We finally decided to take LO for a walk to the park to distract from the pain of teething at 1pm.  LO is happy on the swings .  We are both on edge b/c we are still waiting...  Turdizten finally calls at ten minutes to 2 to say she is about half way here but hit rush hour traffic (no shit sherlock - we live in an urban area she lives in the burbs so yes there's traffic at 2pm into the city!) and that she needs to cancel. Are we available Thursday or Friday? DH says NO we are not and next week we have extra things going on as well (Go DH!)

I'm pissed and annoyed at this point. She invites herself to drop by and then doesn't have the decency to be on time or call us at any point and give us a heads up about it until the time is over.  Normal people with cells phones send a text - Hey On my way see you in 60 minutes!. I tell DH that we need to set consequences for her and should just tell her sorry we are no longer available but he doesn't want to.  

So she finally gets here.  Has to call DH (who set up GPS for her in her car several years ago so not sure why ) for directions from the highway.  We have lived in the same location for 10 years now....Our home is very distinct on the block there is no other building like it and its a bright color but nothing hideous of course.  You don't miss it. She drives right by it.

The following conversation ensues (while I'm wishing I had a brick wall to bang my head against) This is all DH talking as I could not hear Turditzen 

Mom you take a right at Blank Street and another right at Nothing Street.  Yes get off highway at Zero Avenue.  That's exit 1A 

Make a right at Blank Street. Uh huh...Then half mile down and make a right at Nothing Street.  (Repeats himself again)

Make a right at Nothing Street

A Right....at Nothing Street

It's a right on Nothing Street.

Yes right on Blank Street than no its north on Nothing Street. (Repeats himself again)

It's a right on Nothing Street.

What color is your new car again? Did you just drive down the entire block? Ok well back up carefully, you went 5 houses to far,  wait there's another car coming..  Just Mom back down the street there's a space you can park in for a moment and come in .  You can come in a see the baby for a moment. 

Meanwhile I've taken LO into the bedroom to nurse and attempt #3 at a nap for the day. So DH gets MIL into the house who has an doctors appointment (another 45-60 minutes away depending on traffic at 4 and has to leave right away.  So I made sure that she didn't get to see LO (no rewards for being a PIA) . She came in and apologizes up and down and says Oh I didn't mean to get in your way so sorry , (so you realize this is what you've done but you barrel ahead and do it anyway? ) 

Still don't know what's int eh box as LO is too fussy to be interesting in opening it. DH wants to take pictures of her opening it to send to Turdizten to show our appreciation for hte gift. (eye roll)

&amp;#x200B;

I put ambivalent about advice b/c we dealt with it but for future wouldn't mind advice."
818,"I recently posted about an incident involving my MIL trying to come into my house with an old key that no longer worked when she thought no one was home.

That happened after her being bat shit crazy trying to start a text fight with me over literally nothing and ""telling"" on me to my husband multiple times for things that weren't even bad. It was a lot of stuff and it'd take me all night to type it all out. 

Anyway, we go NC on my MIL. My husband never blocks her number though. Despite his shiny spine it's still hard for him to completely and 100% sever ties. She has sent him multiple texts acting like shit didn't hit the fan, like there's nothing wrong. She calls him, texts him asking to video call, she even sends a texts saying she's coming back to town this weekend and wants to visit me and the kids while he is at work and then visit him when hes home. Then she messages asking why we don't want to talk to her or see her. My husband has muted the conversation but I can't help myself and go read them. 

I just want to know if anyone else experiences the same thing?? I wonder how she even has the courage to act like things are fine and I wonder how she is even able to pretend and act confused as to why we arent fucking talking to her anymore. 

WHY?! 

I need to talk my poor DH into blocking her number because there is no way in hell I'm letting her anywhere on our property and if we ran into each other on accident in public I'd walk my ass the other way."
819,"Hi guys, im wanting advice and feedback on others experiences after going no contact permanently with a justno. How has it affected you or your partner?

We have gone permanent no contact with Dr Demento my jnmil. She wont even be invited to our wedding, our children will never know who she is.

Im worried about how this will affect my partner, it cant be easy for him . 

How did others cope, did you regret it or was it the best decision you have made?"
820,"I was telling a friend about this recently and they recommended this sub so this is about the incident that ultimately led to me, Sister 1 and Sister 2 cutting all contact with our JNMum about 4 years ago. (Today, me and Sister 2 and both NC and Sister 1 is now VLC).

OK, so JNMum posted a picture on Instagram where she was, for some reason, posing like a frog like in a yoga-type pose (while not doing yoga) and, for some reason, she was perched on top of our dining table. It was really weird. Sister 1, while on the phone with JNMum, mentioned that she looked like a frog in the pose.

Please bear in mind that Myself and Sister 2 aren't involved in this conversation *at all* and this is where I have to add that JNMum has a history of constantly comparing us to animals and aliens - it's a running family joke that I look like a frog, tortoises, Yoda, and those weird skinny aliens in Men in Black that like coffee, because those are all things she regularly said I look like.

Anyway, despite this kind of joke being par for the course for *her* to say to other people (mostly me, lol), she was upset by the comparison and Sister 1, realising that she had made a mistake, quickly apologised and assumed that was that.

An hour or so later, I get a call from Sister 2 (who is my youngest sister and was about 16 at the time), in literal tears because our JNMum had called her to yell at her for something and had then proceeded to block her on Instagram. I eventually managed to get out of her, that she'd been yelled at for the phone conversation Sister 1 had had with JNMum...despite Sister 2 not being involved in at all. Sister 2, was really confused about what she'd done wrong and was really upset about it. I checked my Instagram and saw I had been blocked too.

I did not care. I was more than used to JNMum's behaviour at this point, and honestly I had only been following her on it to stop her from moaning at me about not following her. However, Sister 2 was borderline hysterical because she genuinely had no idea what she'd done wrong and JNMum had made her believed she hated her. I told Sister 2 I would get it sorted out for her, as I still lived with JNMum at the time.

I called Sister 1 and got the whole story about why JNMum was angry and Sister 1 couldn't believe that JNMum had gotten Myself and Sister 2 involved in something that had literally nothing to do with us and was such a little thing in the first place.

So I went into JNMum's room and basically said ""Hey, Sister 2 has just called me bawling because she thinks you hate her and she's not sure what she did and, honestly, I don't care at all, but you've blocked all three of us on Instagram and 2/3 of us didn't even do anything, so can you explain what's going on so I can tell Sister 2 and calm her down?""

JNMum started ranting about how she unfollowed us so I interrupted and said ""No, you blocked us, see"" and then she backtracked and said ""oh that was a mistake, I just meant to unfollow you because clearly none of you want to follow me on social media anyway"" and started looking really sad. I, admittedly, did not want to follow her and only did it to shut her up, but she didn't know this, so I asked her what she meant and she went on a long rant about how none of us follow her back on Twitter and none of us posted nice messages for her on Facebook on Instagram on her birthday or Mother's Day!!!

I straight up told her she was being ridiculous and that it's not that weird for your young adult children (I believe at the time we were all 22 (me) 20 (sister 1) and 16 (sister 2)) not to want to follow their mother on social media, especially Sister 2 as she was only 16. I told her it's not the fact that she unfollowed us but the way she exploded on Sister 2 and blocked us all because of an argument she'd had with Sister 1. The way she went about it was just spiteful and angry for no reason and had pulled MYself and Sister 1 into it for no reason (not uncommon behaviour).

She ignored the fact that she had yelled at Sister 2 and caused her to cry for no reason and just focused on the whole blocking thing. She continued on saying how she ""has the right to unfollow"" whoever she wants and that she didn't understand why Sister 2 was so upset because if she really cared she would've followed her back on Twitter ages ago. I said Sister 2 barely even uses Twitter and *then* she pulled up a tweet Sister 2 had posted with a picture of Myself and Sister 1 captioned ""my two role models!!!!"" Sister 2 had posted this a while ago, so the fact that JNMum had it ready to go immediately told me she'd been stewing on this for a while. JNMum absolutely *lost it* and started screaming (like full on banshee screaming) that *she* should've been Sister 2 role model and that her posting us (her two big sisters lol) and saying we're her role models was disrespectful.

At this point, I knew rational conversation was out of the question and was preparing to back out of the room. But for some reason I said ""ok, so when you're over this and you want to be all friendly with us again, please don't expect us to just be there waiting for you"" and wow...if I thought she lost it over the role model thing...this was a whole new level of banshee screaming. Just absolutely going in on basically us three sisters for being close to each other.

Important to note, that JNMum did a great job of creating competition between all three of us when we were growing up and that we didn't actually become close until I was about 18 and we realised that she was intentionally trying to keep us apart. It was as if she was only happy if we didn't like each other???

Anyway, I'd been subject to this kind of behaviour my entire life (along with physical abuse) but for some reason, this was the moment that hit me that she was absolutely never going to change, that she was always going to be this mean, spiteful, cruel woman and that I was deluding myself to think her moments of kindness meant anything.

I left the next day and haven't seen her since.

I did write her a letter explaining my feelings because she was going around telling people she didn't understand why I'd left and that I'd blown up a tiny argument for nothing, but she responded to it with ""i'm sorry you feel that way...why do you never bring up the nice things i did for you like taking you to the doctors???...and...we are no longer family"" so I'm not planning on breaking NC anytime soon.

The funny thing is, she talks to Sister 1 once in a blue moon, but not me or Sister 2...despite Sister 1 being the catalyst for it all. Sister 1 always apologises for this and has even told JNMum that Myself and Sister 2 weren't involved in anything (aside from me trying to defend Sister 2), but it never does anything."
821,"I have a fun development.. 
Fiancé and I waited a long time to get engaged (long story short he moved out if his parents when I was 6 months pregnant and realized he needed to get his shit together cause mommy was controlling him) so when we finally did we decided we wanted to do a small ceremony on the coast with just our parents and siblings. Well we found one venue the day we wanted to do it (the anniversary of when we went public with our relationship) but it didn’t work out. So we found another venue BUT turns out there’s a half marathon that day and the runners will be coming through the area we chose. We decided we really didn’t want to look for another venue and pushed the wedding back one week. No problem right? WRONG. My SIL does ballet and every year she’s in The Nutcracker. JNMIL already made a big deal about her missing one day of rehearsals because of our destination wedding but SIL was able to take the day off. Now because we had to push the day back JNMIL, SIL and older SIL are saying we should either: 1) Do the wedding the day before we had initially planned but without them, come back home and do a dinner the day we initially planned, which means sacrificing our honeymoon and doing more driving than we want with a baby 2) find ANOTHER venue 3) wait until spring or 4) wait another year to get married... all because SIL has ballet rehearsals. She’s not a lead role, she does it every year, she doesn’t want to do this after high school. They said if we push it back a week JNMIL and SIL won’t be there. So fiancé and I are really  angry, naturally. JNMIL has not liked the though of us getting married at all, she doesn’t like me. We know SIL would be able to switch the dates but JNMIL is a total bitch and is just using this as another way to guilt us and cause problems. Fiancé and I would rather plan on the new date and have the venue we want and have people that don’t prioritize us not there, than put our lives on hold for people who don’t care about there only son/ only brothers wedding...


Edit: Fiancé talked to FIL and he feels the same way as us. He’d rather SIL miss the whole show altogether than miss our wedding. It’s just one rehearsal and he knows there shouldn’t be an issue with switching the dates


Post edit edit: Fiance reached out to SIL and asked if she could switch the dates, she said she didn’t want to do it now until things were official with the date (aka when park and rev gets back to me about permit fees and such), but she doesn’t think it would be a problem. Realization: it was JUST JNMIL making it an issue... classic MIL move 🙄"
822,"So to start out this is just a rant I'm not looking for diet advice because I am perfectly happy the way I am. 
I originally told MIL that she can come along when I pick my wedding dress because I thought it would be a good bonding experience and she was really excited. Then on family vacation my future SIL informed me that MIL has been talking about me to the rest of the family. She said that I need to lose weight before the wedding because I used to be so pretty before I gained weight in college. And she said that my pictures won't look good because of how fat I am. 
So now I have to diplomatically find a way to uninvite her to wedding dress shopping because if that's how she feels about me I do not want her there. I would rather go with people who think I'm going to be a beautiful bride."
823,"I am not new to this sub, however I made a throwaway for the usual reasons. 

I’m not sure if my FMIL is a JN or not. Also, keep in mind that my future husband is still in the FOG somewhat, however he is working really hard on putting me first. 

FH is military and is deploying soon. We live in different states and I decided to purchase a last minute plane ticket to go see him. I am super happy to see him before he leaves. He tells FMIL, and FMIL miraculously decides she will also buy a plane ticket. For the same days as me. 

I understand her son is leaving and it’s very sad...but there was a whole 3 week period and she chose the same days. Whatever, it is what it is. 

FH and I are not actually engaged yet, however have plans to be before he leaves. FH told MIL of his plans and she is not happy and tells him she is sad she won’t be the #1 woman in his life anymore. She then texts me and tries to convince me not to go. 

My FH and his family are extremely close to the point of sharing each other’s sex lives (I have told him to NOT share ours and to my knowledge he hasn’t) and they are very vulgar and like to over share. I have been very put off by this as I was raised completely different and I’m very uncomfortable in that type of conversation. FH’s family runs their own business and I have been trying to help with it and I feel like I’ve been really trying to put my best foot forward so that they will like me. FH says they like me but that they also just want him all to themselves. (He has 2 sisters) 

I’m mostly here just to rant because I feel like I’m angry for no reason and being overly sensitive. Also, I have a lot of stories I could maybe tell from the past...anyway if anyone has any KIND words that’s also appreciated."
824,"Update: I emailed her.

When I got around to looking at the card she sent, there was a check made out to... Guesses? MyFirst HisLast 🤦
I think I could probably cash the check anyway, but I emailed her the following:

Hi JUSTNO,

Thank you for the anniversary wishes and the gift. Unfortunately, you made it out with the wrong last name and we don't think it'll cash correctly. We will write ""void"" on the check and send it through the shredder for you. 

Xo
MyName --&gt; I should have included my correct last name, but I'm so terrible at thinking of things on the spot! 

No reply yet.

ORIGINAL POST:
DH and I have been married 9 years. I kept my maiden name for a bunch of reasons, which I have had to casually explain to family members when they ask. Everyone knows my name. I've actually had a discussion, in her presence, that I get frustrated when people send mail to Mrs. and Mr. HisFirst HisLast and am tempted to send the mail back. ""Etiquette"" aside, I despise it. (It's ok if you like it! It's up to everyone to determine how they want to be addressed!)

We have a DD(1 yr) with a hyphenated last name. 

All mail we send has a return address of ""The MyLast HisLast Family"". 

[Side bar: my brother died violently during an event of severe bipolar psychosis with hallucinations and delusions, in which he was harming another person and needed to be stopped. It was in the news. The other person survived, thankfully. My brother's death has been traumatic for us and it was also recent so we aren't really ok yet.]

Last month, JNMIL said to me that we should change DD's last name to prevent her from being associated with ""what my brother did"" because ""she'll have a tough time in school"". I almost punched her. Our kid is 1, and many people with whom I am friends on FB, who can see my last name, didn't even realize it was my brother when they read the local news. So I'm not that worried about a potential thing 10 years from now and we will handle it. It felt like a dig, and like, FK YOU MY BROTHER IS DEAD PLEASE STOP. (Also, wanted to tell her we're moving away after she dies anyway and no one will know who we are!)

Yesterday we got mail from her addressed to HisFirst and MyFirst HisLast. 

Just venting because I can't with her passive aggression. This is nothing compared to everything she's said and done to us. I rarely see her and SO gives me that grace to keep my distance because she is such a terrible person. I just needed to vent. Luckily, she's already 80 years old so I hope I don't have long to be free.

Thank you if you stuck with me."

Hi JustANutMeg

Letting you know that I haven’t given up on you. Hope you’re ok and the family is doing well. 

Love you. No matter what is happening for you. 

Thank you for everything you have done for me. I am grateful and truly appreciate the kind things you have done for me. Felt good with a glow of friendship.

Happy 33rd birthday for Wednesday 28th. Sending you happy hugs and wishes for a sparkling day. 

I don’t expect a response to this. Just want to let you know I’m here for you when you’re ready. 

Hugs 🙏

Aside from the weird wording, and the fact it’s been 2.5yrs, so I’m not sure what she was expecting... the bit that had me scratching my head was, she sent it a good two days beforehand. 

The only reason I thought was she might be hoping I’d call her on the birthday, if she emailed with a few days for me to stew over it?

Anyone have any insight?"
826,"I’ve been lurking on here for almost a year or so, and I finally have something to share. I’ll try my best for this to not come out as jibberish, I’m just frustrated and a little emotional right now. Also, I’m on mobile..so, sorry. 
I (F22) have been in college for now four years. It took me a bit to finally figure out what I wanted to do, and now I am one semester away from graduating with and starting a career that I love and am passionate about. My mom always told me that she would never help me pay for college, and that all of it is solely on me. That’s fine. I’ve had my share of struggles and triumphs and it’s made me grow up. On the other hand, my mom also did absolutely everything for my brother who is a year older, and continues to. But that’s not for now. Case in point, my mom has no clue as to what is going on in my personal/ academic life while I’m at college. 

Anyway,

So I am in a medical program at my university. Next semester in January I was supposed to start my clinical rotation and graduate in May. The “director” of my program had everyone who is going into clinicals take a test and score at least a 70% in order to be let in. He made it seem like it was a state sanctioned test and made us bring several forms of ID even though he’s been the test for all of our courses and my class is only about 11, with 7 of us taking the test. Come to find out, it was just some test that he made himself, and it included mainly material that we have not gone over in class yet. This is also the first and only test that the teacher doesn’t curve that absolute shit out of. I did the best I could and studied for weeks before hand, and didn’t get that info until after and was a little disappointed, but, whatever. Life goes on. To make it worse, you can’t take the test again. If I want to, I have to wait until June. 

This ended up being a blessing in disguise in a way because my D(ear) H (29) got accepted into his internship in a town 3.5 hours away and there’s no way we could afford to live apart for 7 months. We’re going to move in with his very Yes parents while I take a semester off and work. I got accepted into a technical college where I can finish my degree within 8 weeks starting next August and everything is still on track for now.

I called my mom to tell her all of this, because we got all of this news within less than 48 hours and the only response that she had for me was that I was ruining my life by not graduating in May and that I’ll just end up dropping out and I will never amount to anything, and then continued to talk about how much better my brother is doing when she pays all of his bills, he barley works, and he bought a house but still lives with my parents 80% of the time. I can’t believe she said that to me, like, what the hell?  I am doing everything I can and I’m completely independent and came up with a plan B right away and I’m still on track.  

Thank god I have my YMIL in my corner. 

TL;DR mom told me I’m ruining my life because I’m graduating 4 months later than expected."
827,"Some friends of ours moved to Tennessee two years ago. We made a weekend visit after they moved, Hubby, our youngest, and I loaded up my Jeep Wrangler and just took off. We had so much fun, we had started planning a camping trip for the summer of 2018. We told no one about the upcoming trip. 

In February of 2018 we ended up with temporary custody of our grand daughter 1 (GD1). Some CPS bull shit, that drug out for an entire year. Hubby built us a teardrop camper for our upcoming trip that was set for July 2018. We kinda rearranged plans for what we were gonna do because we had  GD1, who was 3, with us. All was going great, we were having a blast. Until hubs got a call from his Mom, while playing golf with his buddy. 

She called bitching about the Lowes credit card bill, that is in her name, hubs uses for work. We pay this bill religiously, never miss a payment. My JYSFIL told her to get the card for us when we were trying to finish our house back in 02, before we had our youngest. He loved our girls. After he passed in 2010, she handed him the card to use for work, as long a he paid the bill. No worries we got this. Our son, accidentally let it slip we were in TN. She said he had better not stick her with this bill, and Blah, Blah. 
She totally messed up his golf game, it’s how he gets rid of stress. She told him he had better not spend all his money, he needs to pay the bill. He let her know he paid on the bill before we left, not just the minimum payment either, like 1K. Then it was why we didn’t tell anyone we were going on the trip. He also let her know that we were grown, and the only ones that needed to know were our kids. He cut her off by saying “gotta go, my turn to tee off,” and hung up. His game went to hell after that. He was pissed when he got back to the camp site, and told me what happened. 

We are very frugal with our money. We do not blow our money on frivolous things unless bills are paid and we have extra to spend. We don’t want to trade in our car because we need new tires, yeah true story. We don’t blow money at the casinos. 

Our son got an angry phone call from his dad, reiterating “Don’t tell no one what we do, or where we go. It’s none of their damn business!” 

Oh and Hubby and GD1 had their first trip to an aquarium. I had two toddlers that day. Lmao!!"
828,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/deny8r/should_i_go_nc_with_jnmil_or_is_the_relationship/

Yesterday I took the day off because my cousin passed away monday night. He was my age (28) and of course it was devastating for my family. Last month Cousin went to the doctor to do his routine exams and the doctor noticed something wrong, so he asked for extra tests and found out a cancer in an already advanced stage. We barely had time to digest all that was happening and last week Cousin felt sick, he was hushed to ER and he never left.

Last week, when I heard that cousin was at the hospital, I posted on my instagram asking my friends for prayers and positive thoughts for Cousin. JNMIL saw it and sent me a cute text saying that was praying for him, that he would get over it and get well soon. I really thought she meant well and I wasn't in the mood to see it otherwise, I was just sad and she seemed cute to worry about me.

So, monday night, unfortunately, he passed away, but my mom only told me Tuesday morning when I called her. I was devastated, we were really close, he was one of my best friends, but on the other hand, my family had a lot of cases of cancer and I know how painful the treatments are, how much the patient suffers and how hard that would be for him, so I was kind of relieved that he barely had time to suffer all the effects of his cancer. He found out and a month later, he was gone. He didn't had to do any chemotherapy or went through the pain of any other treatments, so looking this way, I was happy that he didn't suffer. I will miss him so much, but I rather lose him quickly than in a painful long process.

Here's where JNMIL comes in, BF called his parents to give them the news and BF wanted me to talk to JYFIL, because he is really good in this situations. I talked to JYFIL and really helped me, made me feel better, and then, JNMIL started to cry. She was laying on her bed and she started to cry like a little girl. I understand that she could be upset, but she didn't even know him and she was crying like he was a member of her family. I tried to turn off the video call, but she asked to talk to me, and in the middle of her tears, she said that she already knew, she knew that he was gonna die monday since god told her that while she was praying. And she started to cry even harder. She hugged her pillow to dry her tears and kept saying ""Cousin is dead! OMG, cousin is dead!!""

I told JNMIL that it was ok, that cousin didn't suffer, he went peacefully, so it was better for him but she was inconsolable. Honestly, from the moment she said that she already knew, I didn't care anymore about her feelings, that was just another bullshit and I saw a narcissist person trying to use my cousins death to be dramatic and get all the attention. When I realized that I was the one grieving and I was the person that should be consoled not her, I started to resent her so bad that I don't even care about her feelings anymore.

I don't hate her, but I don't have any kind of sympathy for her anymore and I just want distance. I'll let my BF deal with her, since he doesn't want to cut his mom out of his life, but sorry, that was the last time she made me feel bad for her. She doesn't have the right to use my cousin to make the world pity for her, and I just don't want to have contact with her anymore. 

I'm still grieving cousin, but I needed to vent.

EDIT: Hey everyone, I just want to say that I'm sorry I didn't answer all of you yet. It's a little overwhelming to deal with this and I'm the worst when it comes to grieving. I just become weird and I try to stay alone and quiet but your words made me feel warm and really helped. I'm truly thankful for all of you, it means a lot to me that you took some of your time for me.

I think I'm still a little numb, I don't know why, maybe that's how I will cope with all that's happening. Idk, but I just want to say that I read all of your comments and I want to reply you all. I'm taking my time, so sorry if I'm taking too long to do it. Lots of hugs to you

EDIT 2: JYFIL called today to check how I was doing, JNMIL was singing in the back like nothing happened. She didn't even asked how I was. I wasn't expecting anything from her, but if I needed any more proof that she just want all the attention for her, I just got it."
829,"How do I get my mom to accept my new life? 

There’s a lot to unpack here but basically I’m separating from the military this month and am moving with my wife to Washington DC. My mom has NEVER accepted my wife. She always says horrible things about her side of the family to me and it’s at the point now where my wife doesn’t wanna see my parents (absolutely understandable). 

I’m honestly starting to hate my parents. I’m 28 and they treat me as if I’m 19 exploring the world for the first time. I’ve seen a counselor a few times and she said to just set boundaries. I’m honestly hurt that my parents never talk to me anymore and NEVER ask about how we are doing. They are ALWAYS negative and my mom is a narcissist I think. She always talks about HER past and what’s going on with her. 

Little things like “when my daughter died”. She was my sister. Not JUST her daughter. I think I do well with responding to her manipulative pokes at my wife and I, but I did get into a screaming match with my dad a few months ago because they told me to shut up when I was talking. Idk, but I really feel like it’ll never be “good”. Whatever that means anymore. 

Kind of lost, would love some advice. If you need more info please ask, I’m open to any criticism as I try to move on from the last chapter of my life and start a new family with my beautiful wife. 

PS

Seriously, she has dealt with my mom for so long already and actually agreed to marry me knowing how crazy my mom is haha.

Edit: thank you all so much. My wife and I appreciate it more than you guys know. It’s nice to be reassured and advised by people who relate."

*I see you have forgotton your manners again. When someone rights a concerned letter from their heart you respond. Its polite and your being rude. I can't say I expected more from you. I ran into a few of your friends the other day. Remember all those sleeppvers? the days of fun? Well those girls remember and they also said they are worried about you. Everubody things you're mentally ill, OP. They think so. They are worried for your kids and your husbamd. Why don't you want better for your kids? Why won't you let them have a relationship with their grandma? why must they live in filth and eat garbage? You need to give it up and get the HELP YOU NEED for your problems. I will take care of my babies. Its sad when even the ones who you think are your fiends are agreeing your mentally ill.*

*Get some help, OP.*

Updated to add-I do have a felony. Felonies bad check. I was 18/19. I’m 28 now. I served probation, paid it off, and am eligible for expungement when I go home (though I have no desire to go home). She tells folks I have a felony for embezzlement, theft, even abuse. Never what it is, and it’s not something I’ve hidden from my friends, or even my online “family”. It is what it is."
831,"My family is going to thanksgiving this weekend in another city. Meddling Martyr has told me that a family member is undergoing radiation but it’s a secret who it is and to ask my paediatrician if my baby can be around someone who has had it recently. I called a nurse who said it depends on the treatment entirely whether we stay away from them for 24 hours or several weeks. I let MM know that, and she reiterated that his person needs to remain private. I told her that if our family didn’t keep secrets, this would be a non-issue and that we won’t be attending dinner.

I believe her next move will be to offer to babysit and “skip out of dinner” which is not happening.

A normal person would have just asked the person and passed along any relevant info to me. Or trusted that that person would make a conscientious decision. 

MM just wants to stir the ol pot. Any advice for how to handle this without biting the bait?

Am I being unreasonable to be annoyed at this person, since they are obviously very ill, for wanting to keep this a secret? I have to trust they would make sure my baby, who they know is planning to come, is not endangered. I think I’m more annoyed that MM is inserting herself into this."
832,"I’m getting married in March, and my fiancé’s parents still make me call them Mr. ____ and Mrs. ______.... I mean, not make me, but they never introduced themselves by their first names and my fiancé told me they like to be called Mr and Mrs ____ (which to me just seems like a power trip but whatever), but now I’m literally joining their family and I’m still calling them that, and no one has corrected me or told me “oh call me ___”. And it’s a pretty long last name, it’s not like it just rolls off the tongue. It’s just so uncomfortable... am I wrong? I’ve never met parents before that didn’t let their grown adult children’s friends call them by their first names.
Am I stuck calling them this forever..? And how do I switch? Like I can’t just one day call them by the first names, I feel like that’s awkward too?!?!"
833,"So the wedding went off without a hitch, hah. I’m super grateful for that! She was late, of course, and didn’t help with any of the things she said she would / complained was ‘taken away from her’ but it was fine and others stepped in to cover her tasks.

Anyways.

Since I started dating DH, holidays have always been a point of contention and stress. Like, I’ve never had a stressful holiday until her. There’s ALWAYS something wrong with my dietary restrictions, there’s constant negativity, at least one night where she gets way too drunk and becomes extremely obnoxious, prying into DH’s life while I’m essentially ignored, and we aaalways arrive too late and leave too early.

So I hate the holidays now. Even when we spend holidays with my family...she is invited as she has no other family near her, and ends up making it stressful and about her anyways.

The contention this time: it’s a 7 hour drive to her and so DH and I have decided on flying in if we can afford it.  I looked up tickets and if we fly in on Thanksgiving at 5pm (she always flys in on thanksgiving when she visits us) it’s $100 cheaper.

I’m all for it, but DH is concerned his mom will be upset that she has to prepare dinner to be had an hour later than usual if that’s the case. Like, it’s October 9th, I think she’d have enough advance notice for this to be fine. We would also be staying for three days afterwards with that flight, so it’s not like we wouldn’t be showing up super late and not be able to stay...whereas if we drive, we’d have to leave very early Sunday and would be sleep deprived thanksgiving day.

So. She won’t be happy if we fly in cause it’s too late (he hasn’t even mentioned it to her).

She won’t be happy if we drive, because we won’t be present mentally thanksgiving day and would have to leave early Sunday.

What is DH’s solution? Let me call her and see what she wants us to do.

Guys, we are nearing 30...I am tired of him going to mommy for approval on everything and tired of not being able to control my own holidays.

I suggest going to my own family’s instead and he can go to her, he doesn’t like that. I don’t particularly either, but eh, less stress.

But yes...so he wants to ask for mommy’s approval on what we should do that would be best for her.

This lady NEVER asks us when she is a guest, never. Day of our wedding shower? Flys in 1.5 hours away 3 hours before the shower so DH has to wait for her and can’t help me and my family set up. 

Last years thanksgiving? Flys in 1.5 hours away day of late in the day and needs us to drive her to my parents house, so I miss out on spending time with my grandparents that I never see. 

Like...why do we need to be considerate of her preferred timeline when she is 1) never considerate of ours, and 2) has PLENTY of time to plan around a later dinner.

Maybe this is more of a JustNoSO post, but I’m already anxious about the presumed back and forth with her on what we should do."
834,"So this has been going on for years.  My 6 yo son has high functioning autism and struggles with communicating .  When my in-laws are around they are constantly talking over me when I am talking to my son ( which overwhelms him because he struggles with receptive language ) and they contradict what I say ( mom says no junk  they say have all the junk you want etc) which is also incredibly confusing for him because he doesn’t know who to listen to .  Last time they were here he was constantly screaming / crying and hitting himself on the head which I see him do MAYBE once a week if he’s very frustrated and it’s one of the three, not all combined at once and not all day long.  He even covered his ears and locked himself in his room and was pointing and saying “grandpa” because FIL would not back off and give space. In addition to that-  A lot of children with autism have GI issues and require special diets.  My son is not that extreme but we still limit his intake on junk food.  When my inlaws come to town they sneak him junk (candy, caffeinated pop, overly processed junk etc) knowing very well that we have talked to them many times over the course of 5 years not to or to ask us first .  Two times now my son has been in the ER - projectile vomiting and diarrhea  due to overconsumption of crap because of them and one of those times he was also puking up blood.  This last time they were in town, they continued to try and give him crap and I’ve had enough so after they left I stopped communicating with them and told my fiancé that he needed to talk to them because they are not my parents and clearly they have no boundaries and think they can do whatever they want.  I finally talked to MIL yesterday and right off the bat I apologized for not communicating and told her how I was feeling.  She denied everything I was saying and that they are trying to “be good grandparents” and the phone call ended with her yelling at me , which turned into her sobbing and hanging up.  I will stress that I am fantastic at communicating with people when it comes to my sons needs so I have addressed all of these issues I don’t even know how many times now.  I am also a special education teacher and completing school for speech pathology so I am educated beyond just what my son needs.  Wish they would listen to understand instead of listen to respond.  It’s hurting my son as well as myself and my fiancé and their inability to take responsibility is no longer acceptable at this point.  Not when my son hits himself and is screaming and crying all day when they are around .  Any advice? 😞😰"
835,"Hi friends, I’ve newly discovered this sub and thought it would be a great community to join, since I am engaged to a wonderful man with an extremely difficult mother. 

A short highlight reel of the last few years of her behavior:

- FMIL hordes things in her house, including heart-shaped food items (because she thinks it’s a sign of approval from the universe of her second marriage) and goodwill jewelry/purses (she insists there’s resale value but she never manages to sell them, yet keeps collecting anything with a “name brand” tag). 

-However, she constantly says she is trying to clean the house out, and insists that the reason she is unable to do so is because her sons won’t clean out their childhood rooms. These rooms are cluttered from years of her own hoarding of their childhood belongings, but she tries to shift the blame to them. I literally found FH’s baby clothes &amp;baby toys in this bedroom at his mom’s house after spending 2 days cleaning it, it’s bad. She filled it with more shit after we left, I don’t know where it keeps coming from. I’m suspicious that she is collecting shit from other children because there’s so much of it.

- FMIL uses the saga of cleaning out the house to guilt FH into coming home more often. It never works, because FH is pretty good at setting boundaries and doesn’t often give in to her tantrums, but every time we visit she ends up in tears trying to get us to take home garbage bags full of his childhood belongings to our tiny city apartment. She gets upset when we insist be donated.

- FMIL once attended a funeral for a woman who died of breast cancer and proceeded to loudly tell her own breast cancer survival story to the bereaved family, insisting that she understood what they were going through.

-FMIL has told a nasty version of her divorce story to myself many times, and will tell it to anyone who will listen. They both accused each other of cheating and are both happily married to their rumored cheating pal, so I don’t see what the problem is, this all happened like 15 years ago.

-FMIL called FH to inform him of the unexpected death of her ex boyfriend, who lived with FH for some of his youth. Before FH could even process the info FMIL insisted he “finally got what he deserved”. This marked the most notable of what I’m sure will be many interventions by me, in which I insist that she either strongly reconsider the way she speaks to her son in the future, or she can plan on hearing from me in a very serious way when she steps out of line in the future (read: she can go fuck herself).

This time of year means that it comes time to fight with FMIL about how much time she will get with us over the holidays. FH’s paternal grandma is dying, so we plan to spend the holiday with that side of the family. I will be surprised if this grandma makes it to our wedding. FMIL insists that this is not fair to her, for reasons undetermined. FH likes to shut her up if it’s not too much an inconvenience, but I think it’s insane that she thinks she can ask that we do thanksgiving with her an hour east, then turn around and drive 6 hours west to spend the rest of the weekend with grandma’s family, missing the main festivities with them so that we can eat mediocre food and watch Hallmark movies with just her and her husband. I think it’s a firm no, but FH is entertaining the idea so we will see 🙄.

PS: how do your choose your MIL’s nickname? The choice seems like a holy ritual."
836,"edited- he never cheated but did say he missed a girl and wanted to see her over text at the first few week start of our relationship. (Not a big deal but I was pissed cause he lied)

My MIL is the definition of toxic and I am losing the literal love of my life. She is fake, concerned with appearances, dismissive, goes on smear campaigns and is highly narcissistic. My fiancé has neither the courage to put his foot down nor set boundaries unless I make an ultimatum. 

His step dad and step brother are just straight up not involved unless we go over and they both never make time for us so it’s mainly the MIL that is the issue as the smear campaigns have made it even harder with the step dad and step brother. His bio dad and step mom advise to be act dumb and nice. 

Please go easy on me I am young and this is my first serious relationship and I genuinely want to grow old with this person. 

My fiancé and I moved in together in January 2019. Prior to moving in our relationship was incredible and my fiancé has long mentioned his plans to move out for the first time. (We have been together since May 2018) She used to say I was her daughter and a blessing. However her toxic side came out when she started naming his ex’s (that I didn’t know of) and saying how happy she was I wasn’t dramatic like _____. 

In December 2018 before the move I started hearing that she was not being supportive and was trying to get him to second guess the move. Come Christmas, she was being very controlling over the festivities and sat me diagonally apart from my fiancé at the table. My displeasure was evident on my face and it was a huge red flag that he isn’t able to request anything or insist we would like to be together for our first Christmas together and we had the option of doing our own thing at my mothers while she was on holiday. 

While I understand I was a guest, I was seeing a red flag and her distaste for me grew after I was constantly in and out of the house talking with my fiancé. 

Once we moved in (with MIL help) my MIL has texted my fiancé every few days at all hours of the night that she was having nightmares and dreams that awful things were happening to him being away. 

Next my fiancée went over to his parents during a tough time in March 2019 without telling me and his MIL took the opportunity to wipe the floor with me all while fiancé ignored my calls. I don’t know exactly what was said because my fiancé spares me details. That night my fiancé came home enraged and full of toxic thoughts. It was traumatic. 

When we moved past it and my fiancé asked her to change her thoughts about us and myself, 
I saw all of the awful messages she sent about me not deserving him and that she wasn’t going support anything to do with me. It hurt.

We agreed to meet up and when expressing how we were feeling, she specifically told me to stop talking and I stormed out. It was awful and she went on a smear campaign. 

After convincing him to put his foot down MIL sent a really fake text apologizing and saying she was in so many happy tears after I apologized myself. 

Things were better especially since she invited us to her pyramid scheme/MLM event when it was supposed to mend our relationship. 

However after my fiancé and I fought over him seeing someone in the start of our relationship- his MIL came over with garbage bags and came by with a smile on her face.  Now he wants to go see his family and they’ve all sent him sympathy texts for his lying. I have no interest in trying to make things better because she’s 49 and I don’t believe she can change. 

I have offered quick and cheery blurs coming in and out while seeing his family dogs (perfect excuse) but he still wants his mom, step dad and step brother to be more involved and I don’t think there is anything we can do to fix this. 
Help"
837,"Okay, to begin: this an old story.  As in older than I have been in existence, but just thought about it while going over some other stories.

So Staples (my mom) is hated by my JNFather's FOO.  She gets along with the ones that married in, but she doesn't get along with those toxic assholes.  I should go over to justnofamily to go talk about them more.

So Staples and dad got married first, as dad is the oldest.  Makes sense.  Next in line is SC Aunt, who happens to share a *lot* of jn traits with my toxic, disgusting jngrandma.

SC Aunt hated Staples for not other reason than the rest of FOO did.  Yeah, I know, is stupid and that family is like a fucking Mean Girls clique (and not even an entertaining one to watch, either).

Staples decided to wear a *lovely* raw silk dress to SC Aunt's wedding.  Now, under normal circumstances, this would be rude but not horrendous (it typically photographs closer to a champagne colour than white) in comparison to most stories on this sub.

Only SC Aunt wore a significantly more expensive, completely custom made ***raw silk dress***.  Basically because she hated 80's style wedding dresses and wanted something that wouldn't make her look giant as well as taller than her husband.

So Staples *intentionally* wore an off white dress to the wedding, and *matched the bride* as a guest.  Not even as wedding party, ***as a guest***.

If that doesn't describe how petty and pathetic my mother can be with people she doesn't like, I can't think of anything that does.  And I wondered why she seems so miserable; she gets joy from being toxic."
838,"How do you guys deal the emotional struggles of your mom being a grandma to your children? 

My mom and I have a generally terrible relationship because of years of emotional and mental abuse that she fails to recognize or own up to and sometimes it kills me to see her being a grandmother to my baby. 

I have a hard time with feeling obligated to allow her the freedoms of grandparenthood while also feeling like I need boundaries. It’s not like I can bring this up to her because it would immediately turn into a fight that I cannot win. How do other people cope?"
839,"Bot should link previous post, I listened to everyone’s advise and we are looking at a rental home today (and my heart is pretty set on it)
But, I have more annoyances. All from a 15 min span
She: 
1. ate all my deli turkey (literally only craving i have is turkey sandwiches, i microwave the meat first bc pregnant &amp;amp; it’s really not bad) note i paid for this
2. ate all the bread, note i paid for this


disclaimer: these top 2 would not be on the list if she had replaced them. she got home from the store, where she did not get replacements, and proceeded to commit infractions 3 &amp;amp; 4.


3. asked me to turn off my wax burner bc she doesn’t like the smell (but she smokes &amp;amp; comes in stinking like cigs all the time...)

4. told me, and i quote exactly ‘your stomach looks bigger today.’ no affectionate voice inflection, no niceness. and i was sitting. i’m 75% sure she only said it to be mean.

then she gave me a dress she ‘found’ that ‘might fit me’ and it does.. and it’s cute.. and it has pockets. so we’re OKAY for now but she is on thiiiin ice. i’m well acquainted with the art of buying affection/forgiveness, and i don’t love it, but i do love free shit."
840,"Mobile, so as always, sorry for formatting. Have had hard time/day. Had to choose between glasses or food and gas today, so I'm a bit drained, so sorry for typos in advance.

ETA *Okay not so mini*


I've been dark on here for awhile due to increasingly bad health issues. Personal recap: Im still couch surfing at the end of that road, have been re-diagnosed w/ Psioratic Arthritis instead of RA and I'm trying to get into a long term/permanent women's shelter with help of my psychiatrist &amp; therapist, as well help with disabilty. Also surmounting legal issues, including a breach of my data per BCBS. Awesome.

Contact has become minimal at best with Trauma Vampire, because of said issues and I am dealing with this very much on my own apart from the occasional call for food money to her since I am in food stamp limbo. Well, none of us expected me to be out of work near this long. It's a year next month thanks to a firing for a medical emergency, feel free to find that post somewhere in my comments if you are interested. It was illegal but I don't have the time, filing fee, or energy to deal this second with that.

So needless to say bills are amounting up bad, blown up by creditors everyday despite them bring informed. The only reason I have this phone is on ex-SO's grace, prob cheating guilt and knowing that his cheating put me here. I am in such dire straits that when I was told it would be at least December before I'm some kind of able to work at best, and with no glasses and car falling apart, I have requested another loan (on top of loan for my car) from usually yes-if-you-have-a-plan stepdad. They just sold there house, and made some but not alot extra money, so he was not able too before. 

Stepdad agreed to it as long as I agreed to write a legal contract since this loan will be putting me in even more negative with him. But understandbly wants to go over said contract first. He gave me a $200 loan to get through the last two weeks but due to a app update and change he didn't know to check gift option and sent it as for goods or services which includes a charge on my end.

As my mom is the one that usually actually sends it and I have had this issue w/ her several times before, I texted her and asked her if she could please remember to check the gift box before sending since every flipping penny counts and because I'm still gonna have to be paying back the full amount. 

She didn't answer, so I phoned stepdad, told him the issue, he said sure no problem. Sent an additional small loan with no issue to test. This was not a problem for my stepdad or ex-SO. But later my mom called me back and went off on how it was my fault for the fees. I tried to walk her through how to do it and she screamed down the phone that it was my fault personally and not the apps, how could she be expected to remember and how ungrateful I was. But this happened even before the app change, and if you added it up it's probably +$100 I've lost out on, that a certain app just doesn't care about, because of her errors. 

On Monday after the new diagnoses that may set me back permanently, knowing I will inevitably lose use of my hands due to Arthritis, failing my state board exam for a program I got straight A's in due to being administered a wrong/outdated test (The board is aware and investigating), then locking my keys in my car my door handle breaking off all to get in to find my car died because the hood was stolen (don't ask) and water got in, I was done. I wanted someone to talk me down from a panic attack, and despite being a wretch of a person she still will stop being a b* to talk me down. I called but no answer. Called everyone I knew, nothing. Eventually called someone I knew would help, but didn't want to trouble them as they constantly have helped me and live far from my location. 

Tried calling another few times over the week, straight to voicemail. Heard some family gossip. Its hard to believe, but the rest of my family is actually a million times worse than Vampire. Called her to revel a bit, because we have that hatred towards the rest in common. Voicemail again, but this time I leave a message. She calls back quickly, I spill the tea, we laugh. I ask her how are things in newly moved to state, as I prepared to tell her about my unfortunate news, she says great I like it here but im not happy with you. It had been five days since our last call and with everything else being more pressing I totally forgot about it and forgot she hung up on me. I was like what are you talking about? She recaps ^ and says she doesn't like me blah blah. Also accuses me of the one screaming down the phone. So I said um ok well if you do not want to talk to me you don't have to? So she said okay bye and hung up.

I know she's definitive JustNo, but did I handle it well? Am I overreacting? Should I have been more patient and just let her chew me up, do I sound ungrateful? Even if I do, it's stepdads money anyway to give anyway and he knows how grateful I am. 

I wish I had any other option left than to go to my stepdad for money. I'm so ready to be lowest contact to no contact possible with her.

ETA: a sentence and a typo and another sentence."
841,"I wanted to give an update since everyone was so helpful on my last post. Thank you to all the comments, you guys have helped me find my spine. You can find the previous post in my history, but my Mom threw a major tantrum when she found out I wanted my Dad to walk me down the aisle instead of her and threatened to sit at the back of the church instead of up front with all the other parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I left out a vital detail that I didn't see as relevant until I told the story to my D(ear)H. My sister and I have always told each other when our Mom was upset with the other and my mom knows this. I didn't really think too much of it when my Mom's tantrum was relayed to me through my sister...

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my Mom, ready to explain why I wanted my Dad to walk me down the aisle and my Mom immediately told me that she understood, I didn't have to explain myself at all. I then realized I don't have a JNMOM, I have a JustNo Sister. My Mom never wanted me to know she was upset and told my sister not to tell me, she just wanted to vent.

 

Not only did my sister tell me about my Mom being upset in private, when I told my sister NOT to tell me anything else, she made a point of telling me that ""your toast to Mom means nothing to her"" and she just ""wanted to let me know"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I will be posting the entire drama with my sister on JNFamily, but I wanted to tell you lovely people that it turns out my Mom really just wanted my day to be special and while she was extremely upset, she wanted to keep that away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. The wedding was amazing and went off without a hitch"
842,"So I posted just last week about my MIL trying to manipulate DH because we don’t see her enough and she thought moving closer would give her more time to see our little family. In that same text she talked about she was going to stay with a friend for a week to see about moving to a different city (FINE BY ME. GOODBYE!)

So brings us to today. Hubby hasn’t said a word to her. Hasn’t heard anything from her. But last night, she texts him “I know you are probably angry with me, but I have to be out by the 21st. No one will help me. I don’t know what to do. Just thought I would let you know.”

No apology for what she said! Just more pure manipulation! I don’t know what my husband plans to do. I’m wondering if this should be a hill to die on? I’m so tired of my husband being abused by this woman. Our money is tight right now so basically she is asking for ANOTHER hand out asking him to move her hours away again. I would really just love to rip her a new one but I’m pretty LC with her myself."
843,"Yeah so I’m only 18 and I’m in nursing school (LVN). I plan to move out after 1  to 1 &amp;1/2 years once I’m stable and I’ll never have to talk to her again. Today she really tried my patience. She’s very manipulative and toxic and abusive towards me and she always targets me because I don’t tolerate the abuse. She likes to pretend she’s a good person but it’s all a facade. Recently she has begged me to go on vacation with her for three days, not considering that I have school (time based program so every hour there matters) and that I don’t like her. So she decided to tell me that she was gonna get my dad to come over and “babysit” me. As if I’m not mature enough to watch myself. Issue is that she doesn’t trust me because she thinks I’ll invite my boyfriend over. But the thing is.....I don’t have to be in her house to do “it” with my boyfriend. Frankly she, and nobody in this world has say over what I do with my body. ESPECIALLY if I’m being safe. Anyways she decided it was a good idea to tell me that and I went BALLISTIC. Yeah I know it was probably a manipulative trick to get me to come but she is so vile and disgusting for stopping so low. He’s been absent for most of my life and she knew where he was....so they both lied and I can’t forgive them for that. What hurts even more is that he’s only 5 minutes away. Yet I never even got a letter from his sorry *ss. But it’s all good, because I love myself and I know that I deserved better. It’s too late to play daddy and daughter because I’m too grown up for the bs. Regardless, if she does invite him I’m going off because I’d rather kick it with rats before dealing with him again. It’s so unfair because she has a dad so she’s NEVER understand how I feel. She never apologized and she doesn’t care because in the black community, accountability is like the plague. Once I’m gone, she’ll regret the things she’s done to me because I’m reclaiming my peace and I’m choosing happiness."
844,"Ok.  I suck as a redditor.  I do not re-read my previous posts as most of that crap is traumatizing and I have no desire to relive that.  That being said, I may repeat information that I have previously stated, and for that I apologize.  Now onto the insanity that is my life.

I was adopted by PH and edad before age one.  I recently decided seek out my biological family, for medical reasons.  I found a biological mother and 3 half siblings.  It was neat to meet adults that were raised in completely different environments that had similar personality traits to myself.  Who knew smart-ass was hereditary?  Of the siblings I really connected with one brother.  It was just that instant friendship, twisted sense of humor thing.  He passed away unexpectedly a week ago.  I have many feelings that I cannot even begin to unravel, but that's not what this post is about, that's what I pay my therapist for.

Here is where things go left.  When his obituary was published, my name was put in as his sister. I wasn't consulted, but I wasn't upset either.  Well, PH reads the obituaries every single day.  Yeah, you can see the path to crazy-town that I didn't anticipate. 

The funeral, visitation and burial all took place over one day.  I showed up at the funeral home to pay my respects, as that is the decent thing to do, and who is there? PH. Now after my Uncle's funeral I really thought she would pull back on the crazy, but no.  I decided I was done.  If I cannot have peace, with people she doesn't know and if she would disrespect such a tragic end to a young life I am over being a nice person.  I went to my car, as to not cause a scene during the grief of others, and called my husband, my friend/attorney, and the police.  

The police arrived before my husband and attorney and I showed them the restraining order paperwork.  Initially the police were telling me that without my biological mother telling them that she wasn't welcome, there was nothing they could do.  Then my attorney arrives with the paperwork where she violated the RO at my uncle's funeral; how she had repeatedly violated the RO since it was issued and how we had carefully documented the incidents; all without inundating them with bogus accusations. The officers then arrested her for violating the RO.  This was all done without a scene detracting from mourning the loss of a young man.  

Here is where things went differently than expected.  PH was booked after all the judges had left for the day and couldn't get a hearing until the next morning.  Who knew that by not pursuing each and every infraction that when I put my foot down the legal system would perk up and listen.  When PH appeared in court with her church lady act, her attorney and her smug belief that she would be believed implicitly, I was pissed.  I just want peace and she just wants insanity.  

PH's attorney starts her spiel.  PH is the victim of a vengeful daughter.  I have apparently lied about PH because I am jealous of her(?), her standing in the community(?), her relationship with my children(?), and her piety(?).  Yeah, OK.  Then my attorney starts talking.  He pulls out evidence from the attacks from her church members, the broken funeral agreement, the stalking, stealing my dog, along with everything else. The judge questions PH's attorney about the presented evidence and I learned I am truly diabolical.  Evidently PH was forced into her actions by my abuse, and incessant drama. Here is my favorite part.  By refusing to allow her to dictate my actions I made her have to go to extremes to get my attention.   I am simply a rebellious child who needs to be reprimanded.

The judge ruled that since PH cannot/will not stop her harassment she must stay in jail until a trial. I am awaiting the incoming family and church insanity with video cameras and anti-anxiety meds."
845,"First of all, thank you all for all the support and everything. I read all comments, just didn't had the head to reply to all. (Especially with spotty network. But I know you guys understand, even if my own mother doesn't, so also thanks for that. You guys are spoiling me!)

So now onto the trip. It was fantastic. I loved it there. I think we will be going next year again, when it isn't so cold and wet. 

The whole time there, mother found something to send me messages about. I ignored the most of them, like those concerning some letters she received half a month earlier and are now super urgent. I only answered those about how she wanted to put some super easy climbable shelf next to DDs play desk. DD is a very mobile toddler and she will be on top of that in less than 2 days.

MS also informed me on how she was washing my laundry. Some problems with that. First being she shouldn't be in my room in my house. Next, I didn't have dirty laundry. Third, I hate strong detergent smells. I told her to leave it alone and I think she was sulking but promised me to stop doing laundry.

When we got back, she had hung laundry all over the apartment. I have a dryer and I put almost everything in that. Even the jeans. Hey, they are old. Now MS, she thinks that thing is just a electronic waste and destroyes all clothing. So she only uses it for towels and that on the lowest settings. I don't have much laundry hanging place indoors and its cold and wet out. So she hung it everywhere, except the still empty and not used rooms intended for DD. She hung the most in my room, with no window open, no ventilation. I had to ventilate at 10pm, when we finally got home after a 4 hours drive. And she washed all our jeans trousers, towels, many tops and shirts and most of DD's cloths. At least DDs cloths were with no smelly detergent, so one set less for me to rewash. 

They also rearranged the living room, moving eg the babywear somewhere I yet have to discover. And, apparently, they returned about 60 € worth of bottles and crates. There are other small rearrangements. 

I get it. She wants to make it easier for me. But I didn't ask for help, I didn't want help and I have more work due to her interfering. 

So that's it. A lot of fun in the vacation. And a load of bulldump from MS

PS: remember the lamb I wanted to cook before the vacation? It was to heat us up for the cold weather in the mountains. We all have a little cold. I blame MS. I know it's petty. But I have a headache. So let me. Love you guys nonetheless."
846,"How do I cope with the anger that I feel? DH talked to MIL about bad behavior, breaking rules, and violating boundaries. If you’ve read my previous posts you’d know that these involve child endangerment, which she’s notorious for. Bottom line is that she’s lucky to be allowed to see LO and I do have to babysit her around LO. Well DH confronted her since we’re approaching another visit. 

I was shocked that she DIDN’T APOLOGIZE! You’ve been asked to explain yourself as to why you walked up to DIL and grabbed LO from her body immediately after smoking a cigarette and all you have to say is that you “forgot”?! Forgot to think about someone other than yourself? Forgot to think about the innocent baby?! I’m tired of babysitting MIL... reprimanding her for doing shit like this that simply shouldn’t happen. I’M ANGRY! She takes zero accountability for her bad, bad behavior. 

Was told to stop food bullying me. Was told that she has to ask to hold LO and that she can’t baby grab. Was told to not even ask or attempt if she’s high or drunk, even buzzed, been smoking etc. Told not to say rude or insensitive things or to criticize out parenting choices that are all based on research and consultation with the pediatrician.

Help me out guys... how did you guys move on and stop being angry? She gets to be in our lives if she can put LO first and help us keep her safe but she admitted that she’s liable to forget. I have hatred. 

Am I internalizing this too much? I was a child that was not advocated for, abused, neglected at times, and mistreated in general. LO will not grow up to say the same, I have too much respect and love for my baby. 

I think part of it is that she was not a good mother, DH has a somewhat similarly pitiful upbringing as well, yet she acts high and mighty and arrogant about trying to perpetuate the cycle and expose LO to inappropriate behavior.   

Thanks for reading. 

HELP."
847,"this is a little different than most of the posts on this sub, but idk where else to put it and i need to vent, possible tw for homophobia.

my husband was raised in a cult-y fundamentalist family, and when he was a teenager they sent him to conversion therapy before throwing him out. luckily his adoptive mother is cool as hell, but members of his biological family have started trying to ""reach out"" on behalf of his mother, who apparently wants to ""reconnect"". uh, hard fucking pass. i wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated your own fucking kid, so you don't get to flit back into his life and terrorize him to soothe your own guilty conscience. play shitty fucking games, win shitty fucking prizes."
848,"I'm new here, apologize if I do this wrong. I was super stressed out the other day after having gone through a long very long weekend where DP (I'm guessing it means dear partner) was in and out like usual but gone for longer stretches of time just trying to be the host for their cousins visiting family. 

It seriously pissed me off. I work 8 to 5 everyday and commute an hour to work and an hour home. When the weekend comes I want to try to enjoy it as much as I can and at the very least rest.

Well all that was shot to hell. No salvaging any part.

Dp was attending to their cousin and their cousins family every. damn. day. Getting or making them food. Making them drinks. Spending all their time with them. Taking them out. 

So I did what you ask? I stayed in and took care of our baby. 24 hrs x 4 by myself. Feedings, cleanings, activities, bedtime. Everything. They came in, did dishes If we had it and then left. 

I'm livid but what can I do? Finally I go out and join them  for a little bit. I'm tired of staying and doing everything, shit I might as well get out right?!

I go out and have a decent/good time. Until it gets to the end to leave. MIL grabs my child repeatedly during the event. I let it slide cuz I should enjoy a break right? Then MIL says come to mama and I look dead at her ass. This isn't the first fucking time I've heard her say some shit like that. Shes always been annoyingly loud going oooohhhh aaahhhhh OOOOOHHH MMMMMYYYYYYY BBBBBAAAAABBBBYYY! The fuck?! You're baby? You're kidding me right? No I kid you not. She says this shit all the time. All. The. Time. Including at my child's birthday party. Yeah. She did. 

So back to the end of the evening. Were loading up to go. And I decide to change their diaper. Here she comes in my face ""you dont need to take off their shoes, here I got it"" right in front of my SIL. Then proceeds to change my child's diaper. She always does that. Everytime. She knows better. She can do it better. She tells me get with it. Come on shape up.

I just want to tell her fuck you.

I limit my necessary time around her when I can because this shit grates on my nerves and if I stand up and say something they are sensitive, they love playing the victim, bully, and hero. And talking about their kindness. On top of that they will change what they say/recommend in favor of an argument or if they are proven wrong and are losing favor.

MIL straight up told me my baby confuses her with me. And calls her mama. I could've punched her. I wanted to send her ass to the moon. 

One time she raised her hand as if to strike me like I was one of her fucking kids cuz the place was a mess and DP had been gone all day. Never apologized. Never said anything about it. 

I'm desperate to figure out a better living situation as they live super close and use to drop in and invade our privacy. 

Lately, DP has been taking our baby to see them whenever I need a break and yell at them about it. It's really been getting on my nerves a fuckton. She always acts like my baby is her child. Everytime I'm around shes always doing some extra shit. Goes and gets food and gives it to him without asking me or gives it to him/tease him with it and then asks me if it's ok. Like wtf you just teased him with it?! Now he wants it. 

Last night we got into it. DP said I dont clean, cook, etc. And I snapped. After such a long fucking weekend and work I couldn't take it. Told them off. Said they're never gone to help and when they are they're always looking to try to get out or do random shit. I can barely manage to brush my teeth or hair. 

I love DP but this isn't the first time we've talked about them stepping up. And I'm honestly tired of repeating myself and going through the wash. Rinse. Repeat cycle were stuck on. 

I'm mentally tired from fighting my own anxiety all the time. Physically working and commuting during the day. And then to come home to that it just makes me even more tired, and sad, a little bitter, and very pissed. 

I spend my time making sure my baby is fed, clean, having fun activities and using the time I can after to use the washroom and sleep. I barely eat. My sleeping is shit and I'm restless. Some days aren't that bad. But I'm tired of the exhausting cycle. My weekends are not even weekends. They're just days I dont work and get to be home to try to do more chores.

Edit to correct the awful spelling errors."
849,"Call me a mean terrible person, but (here the but) she was a demon on earth. 
     So to start where I left off, SO left me while I was asleep. The next morning I was disoriented. He only took a back pack and his dog. This was on July 7th I think. I was left with a 3 bedroom house, pool, and all that comes with it. I had no idea where he was and didn't hear from him for an entire month. I had to borrow money from my mom to pay rent. Before he left he had me pay all the utilities with my bank account. This left me 95$ for the whole month as I'm on disability and only get paid monthly. He left me with a broken car also. 
     I finally found him on FB and sent him a message that I needed help with this. He was so nice. He helped me for about a month. He helped me move out into my apartment etc.
     During the time he was helping me, He only went to see dear MIL in hospice house once. One morning after he went to work, he called me and told me his mom was in active death. According to the hospice chaplain she was no longer conscious.  This is when all went to hell in a hand bag! 
     Dumb ass me, I was staying nights with him and trying to salvage our relationship. Bad idea! The last night I saw him we were going through his mother's things and finding pictures for the slideshow for her funeral. The next morning he left me at his place to go to work and I dug through more of her shit because his roommate wanted all of it moved out of the middle bedroom so he could move a bed out of there. I thought I would do it because he had so much going on. Glad I did! 
     Here's the kicker! There was a nightstand that was by her bedside when she was still at home. I pulled the top drawer opens and saw an envelope of pictures. I knew immediately what the pictures were because I hadn't found the pictures that she tortured me with every time we would visit her in the past. They were pics of him and his ex. He had thrown them away years ago and she ""saved"" them from the trash. She would make a point to pull these pics out every time we visited her. Mind you, these were just pics of a HS love from back when he was still a zit faced teen. I wasn't bothered by them except that she tortured me with them. Most of the time I would just roll my eyes when she pulled them out. It was like a broken record really. She would act all secretive like I didn't know she saved them. Ugh. I just can't believe she had them right by her death bed within reach! Well said pics went straight into my purse. Haha! Said pics ended up in a trash can at a truck stop miles away from our home town. Haha!  Call me evil or whatever, but I was NOT going to let that come up again or be part of a slide show to torture me at the funeral. A revenge from the grave. 
     I never told him I had found them. I'm pretty sure he knew they were there anyways. He has never said anything about them to me. 
     So SO talked me into going to see dear MIL on her death bed at hospice. I figured what's the harm? She's unconscious anyways. Mainly did it for him. I'm just a glutton for punishment, I think. I was left in the room with her for a couple of minutes while he went to the restroom. Guess what I did? I told that evil bitch that I had found those pics and that no one will EVER see them again because I threw them away at a truck stop far away! It felt good to say that to that dying bitch. I told her ha ha bitch! I'm alive and you aren't! I feel so bad now, but at the time I was livid! She did that shit on purpose! Just to hurt me! 
     MIL stayed in limbo like this for 2 weeks. It was at strange to me that EVERYONE was treating her as if dead already, except SO. He sat in a chair in the corner of the room where she was facing opposite direction. In the dark. He never touched her or even let her know he was there. I'm sure he had a lot of decisions to make. 
     I later found out about the #2 revenge from the grave towards me when he told me the songs she picked for her funeral. Get this, Leather and Lace by Stevie Nicks!!! This song is the song she used to send to her ""boys"" that I found highly innappropriate! SO said it reminded her of them so he was going forward with playing it because it's what she wanted. 
     His younger brother never came to see her on her death bed and I'm sure it would hurt him to hear this nasty song. He said ""call when she's dead"". 
     She ended up dying on Sept 29th at 4:50pm. I have not spoken to him since. He blocked my entire family. I will be posting the aftermath tomorrow. Oh it gets better! Thank you all for taking the time to read my story. I really needed to tell someone and just get it out of me. Love and peace to all."
850," First time posting here, I posted earlier on r/insaneparents but had less information. I am not sure if this is the best way, but here is my situation. My girlfriend has been living with her mother basically her whole life and is now 21 and ready to move out. She had an accidental child when she was 18 (not with me) so it has been tougher to save up money and get her own place. We have been together for two years now. I have offered for her to move in with me, but the baby daddy has threatened to take her to court for full custody if she does that. She has also considered just finding an apartment in the mean time to avoid that whole situation. So how does this involve the mother? Well, first off, her mother basically puts her down for every decision she tries to make as well as her outfits, hobbies, music, etc. She will tell her she is being stupid and she doesn't know what she is doing. She has taken her child places without telling my girlfriend and has made decisions regarding visitation without my girlfriend's knowledge. She also told my girlfriend that I am never aloud to see the baby unless it's under the mother's supervision. She also makes my girlfriend pay for all of the groceries each months, half the rent, and the entire family phone bill. This conveniently adds up very closely to the amount of income she makes a month. My girlfriend has always noticed this about her mother, so she asked me how to save money. I told her to try and just pay for her own things and not everyone else. I didn't want to get into the middle of everything, but when my girlfriend told me all of the bills she pays for, something just didn't add up. She was definitely paying way more than anyone in that house. So my girlfriend brought this idea up to her mother to pay for just her own things so she could save money to move out. Next, her mom freaked out and yelled at her, called me to ""stay out of their business"", and then wrote ""timeline rules"" that I had to follow in regards to spending time with my girlfriend and/or her child. She reads my girlfriend's emails, bank account statements, and even text messages. I want to help my girlfriend get out of the toxic environment, but I am not sure how. I hate to see her so trapped in her home like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
851,"Hi everyone, stumbled across this thread. Not sure if I’m in the right place as everyone who is posting seems like they are the wife of a Bad MIL situation. The DH acronym is throwing me off. 

Anywho, So quick back story. Im a man and getting married in two months to my SO. Things are great with my SO and I don’t have any instances of her being the issue with my MIL. We have dated for 3.5 years. Got engaged almost one year ago. 

Ive know my MIL to have a rocky relationship with everyone in her family. MIL and FIL have been on the brink of divorce for years, they just wont go through with it because religion. On numerous occasions i have witnessed my MIL throw tantrums, make wild accusations about anyone she is fighting with. Her arguments always escalate to calling you rude or telling you that “you must hate her”. It’s always a dismissal of the situation and nothing gets solved because “she’s hurt”. Typical only talks about her feelings and only apologizes by saying “i’m sorry you feel that way”. Also she will always use the past against you. FIL has moved out of state to get away from her. That was 2.5-3 years ago.

The relationship between my MIL and SO is also terrible. My SO can never express her concerns because it’s always met with. “ well you did X a few months ago” or “lists all the good things” she has done for my SO”.

It’s been exhausting to say the least. I have always been on my SOs side but I never got involved in there fights. I even early on played devils advocate a-lot and tried to get my SO to see her side.
About a year ago my SO decided she was really going to try and have a honest relationship with her. (Setting boundaries, not letting things go for the sake of peace).

It wasn’t until after we got engaged did I start to see my MIL as the problem. Before I always felt the FIL was the issue. Now i feel the complete opposite. Ive started to see my MIL manipulations and narcissistic behavior for what it is. Additionally since we got engaged, MIL has been using the wedding to get FIL to talk about their personal issue. Her entire family is using our wedding as a selfish means to control and have their own needs met. Her family is incredibly selfish and I’m surprised my wife isn’t like them. She would give you everything if she had nothing.

Sorry for such a long backstory.

So now the problem is:
I have gotten incredibly impatient with my MIl and SO not getting where. Started to feel like my MIL was using me. (Since FIL left I have become the main go to for handy man level work)
I didn’t mind helping but she oversteps boundaries. It came to the point where there is a list on the whiteboard in their house that says “Tom’s Chores”
A lot of this has been building but I’m trying to keep this post short.
Im not confrontational so this doesn’t help the situation. I haven’t ever really brought my concerns to her.

Anywho, I’m helping around the house and my SO and MIL got into a huge fight because my SO tried to bring up something that was bothering her. We leave and she calls me, put her on speaker because i was driving. She Eventually telling my wife its all her fault. I explode on her telling her its both sides. We decided to hang up cause we were all upset.

MIL texts me complaining about how I disrespected her (which I agreed too because i yelled). She just had a-lot of complaints to things and i felt she was reaching to prove a point. (She has done this in the past so I wasn’t surprised. Ultimately ending the message with a “i know where i stand with you now” lines. 

I decided I wasn’t going to let her dictate where i stand. So i sent her a short story of all my issues with her behavior during this fight, tried to set boundaries about how i don’t appreciate the constant accusations and told her they weren’t based in reality. That she had a pattern of jumping into a fight with wild accusations and generalizations and that i was tired of it.

I explained all of the issues i had with what she said to me over texts and to clear up how I don’t like the way she treats my SO. Its been increasing happening in-front of me and I’m trying to stick up for my SO when my MIL abuses her. 

I didn’t say anything disrespectful or anything remotely abusive. Just how i felt with facts and patterns of behavior. Long story short. I send this long message and get nothing. I text her a few days later asking if we can talk about it over the phone. She asked if we can meed in a public place.

I get there and begin with trying to talk about it. She just comes up with this excuse that “there are things about her i wouldn’t be able to understand” then basically set a boundary across the table that I shouldn’t say things because i don’t know her well enough”

She then proceeds to tell me that she realized she doesn’t really know me and that she thought we could just get to know one another. Claiming she never really has been with me alone and that she just hoped the relationship would develop on its own. She told me a few of the nice things I’ve done and how she always thought i was really nice and thoughtful. She than began asking about where i grew up, school, work. Real basic level stuff I thought you would know about a person after seeing me for 3+ years. Spending time with me. Ive done 50+ hrs of work in their house. Helped her mom with computers, cars, housework, financial planning advice. As far as i was concerned, we had a developing relationship. I didn’t like how she treated others but I really tried to not hold it against her. Especially all the crap she has done to my SO. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I have minor projects to finish up in their house. I just don’t feel comfortable around her anymore and i wish to just be civil with her for the foreseeable future. I have CPTSD and had a difficult childhood myself. She just triggers me, she is manipulative and Im not well equipped enough to handle her right now. Both my wife and I are working on the boundaries thing but mine are so easily broken. I just am having trouble trusting her and continuing to be fake or even say my piece. She finds a way to make it seem like I shouldn’t be involved in Her and my SOs problems. No matter how abusive she is. All her tactics are passive aggressive and covert. Which is the worst for me because of my past. To clarify, ive never confronter her on things she’s said to my wife when MIL and SO are alone. I tried to only bring up the stuff that clearly happens infront of me.

She is affecting my life because our intentions give me anxiety. Ive had trouble sleeping and focusing at work, but i know thats not all her fault. I also know she isn’t going to change and my gut instinct is to stay far away from her. I get triggered by people like her and re-traumatized and it makes it difficult to have the unrealistic relationship that she wants. She has complained to my wife that i don’t pick up the phone and call her. She is a hypocrite and up until this point hasn’t actually told me this. 

Im just not interested in the constant battle to live up to her expectations and the constant abuse she deals out when you don’t live up to her expectations that she cant even communicate to you. I feel really hopeless. MIL and FIL have killed all joy of our wedding planning. Im dreading our wedding now and dreading my future relationship with MIL. My SO is on board with whatever i chose to do with my relationship with my MIL. I just need some more perspective. 


How should I proceed? Im sorry if I haven’t fully explained myself or went off on tangents, im a bit of a mess today. I’m on mobile and at work right now too. Thanks for any help you’ll can provide."
852,"There’s plenty of posts here about how y’all turn whatever your MIL/mom says against her. I wish I had this talent. However, I’ll just go straight to the story.

Earlier this year, both my JN parents were screaming at me to stop wasting my time and apply to a company in the industry they want me to be in. Instead of “crappy jobs that a high school graduate could do.” News flash. Your generation fucked up the job market. Certain jobs now require a bachelor’s and pay shit.

So just to get them off my back, I create a profile on their website and apply to their associate roles. This was also around the time I get pressured into doing the same certificate program they pressured me into (it’s a useful certificate to have too in all fields but the target industry depresses me).

So I get a call from that company around the time my certificate program starts. I ace the interview but unfortunately can’t attend the training as it’s out of state and I can’t do it remotely. But they’re nice enough to say “call us in 6 months when this certificate is done!”

Fast forward 6 months. I called them at the end of last month and am now working on the onboarding process to start in a couple of months. Out of state, far far away from JNmom’s bullshit with a decent salary. AND IN A STATE WHERE I CAN SMOKE ALL THE LEGAL WEED AND EAT AS MANY BROWNIES AS I WANT. I get to leave this hellhole, JNmom and JNdad get their bragging rights. Everyone’s happy.

This is JNMIL. So of course JNmom pulls some shit. I have to go to a place to do a thing as part of the onboarding process. Pretty standard. Before I go, JNmom spews her crap.

JNmom: “You know, that company is a shitty company. They’re pretty fickle in how they treat their employees. Your dad and I won’t be mad if you leave at any point 🙂”

I look her dead in the eye and remind her that she and my dad screamed at me to stop wasting my time and apply there, as I informed you good people that they did, all those months ago. 

JNmom: “But that was when you had no other proooooooooosssssspeeeeeeectssssss. So and so’s neighbor knows this one skill and got a job at other well known company in the town over! You have a whole certificate in this whole field and know so much more than that one skill! You can get a job heeeeeeeeerrrrreeeeeee!!”

So now we know her game. The thing is. This company has a location riiiiight here to place me at. And I get to stay close to my SO too if I stayed here. But this is my FUTURE. I may not like the industry I secured this job in, but I have a fucking plan. Save money for a year and go back to school to do what I want, when I have the money. And also moving away and going LC. 

**I can’t go NC because of the doggo**

So no, JNmom. Keep your hateful comments to yourself."
853,"I haven't directly heard from Slappy since her last warning but her passive aggressive Facebook game is still good.

We've had a bit of a tough time recently.  My feckless ex finally called our sons to tell them that his new fiancee was pregnant and they were going to big brothers.  He then berated them for not being excited!  

The next day Slappy posted the following:

""I am so excited to tell you that I am going to be a granny again.  I absolutely love (new fiancee's name) and know that she's going to be the best mummy because she understands that a baby needs ALL of his family.  I can't wait to see all of all my babies together and spoil them rotten""

Ok.  First off all, fuck off.  Secondly, on what planet does she think that is ever going to happen?  She's not allowed to be near us and her darling son doesn't care enough about his existing children to spend any time with them.  If she wanted to spoil them then she wouldn't be Happy about the fact that they frequently have to go without.

She's deluded."
854,"So my oldest brother didn't give up after all. He gave it a few days' rest before contacting me again on a social media messenger. 

He sent me a photo of my mom's phone where she texted me, word for word, ""I'm sorry for whatever u think I did wrong."" Nevermind the fact that that's not an apology in the slightest, but she sent this after I informed her twice that I was blocking her (months ago). I've never replied to any of her texts about mail or anything since then. So why would she think that sending this would make everything ok?

Guys... My brother's attempts at guilting me haven't weakened my resolve on my position in the matter, but it's broken my hope that my FOO can ever respect me at all. 

""Whatever it is, whatever mom did to you that you think disrespectful, don't it ever came to your mind that you, we are just her children? Think out of the box, what would you feel, if time comes that DD would do this to you?""

So of course it worked and I felt the need to explain exactly why I ""think"" my mother is disrespectful. Gave him plenty of examples. Does my brother care about my feelings, or my daughter's? Nope. He only cares about his mother. Does he acknowledge my point that my daughter would never cut me off because I actually treat her with respect? Nope, even my position as a mother doesn't matter, only mommy dearest matters here.

It was almost like he disregarded all my very clear examples to say things like, ""Where is SO? Maybe I can visit him now to talk,"" and, ""What you don't understand is the big picture. What comes around, goes around."" After I asked him to just leave me alone or I'd block him too, he said, ""Do it then. I just hope later on, you will not experience this with your own daughter. But... now... give me your location."" 

GTFO. Brother3 demanded my location once, after I ""disrespected"" him by asking for a little privacy, and that one ended up showing up unannounced at my job to slap me around until I pressed the alarm button, and he left before the cops showed up. So I told Brother1, that if he shows up at my home, I'll call the cops on him.

HE FUCKING CALLED ME ""pure evil"" BECAUSE I ""answer"" HIM IN THIS WAY. EXPLAINING WHY I'VE ALWAYS FELT DISRESPECTED AND WILL NOT BE SPEAKING TO MY MOTHER MEANS I'M PURE EVIL.

I should've listened to some of you from the last post, especially the one that said don't JADE. Well, now this brother got blocked too. His phone, his social media accounts, and even his wife's phone since that's apparently what he was originally texting me from. If anyone else from my FOO or their close friends decides to try to back my mother or even dispute how I feel about the situation, I'm giving them an instant block. I tried to work things out with my brother (who knows why, when I've seen him twice in 14 years), and it failed miserably, so I don't need to put in any more effort just to be disrespected again. What, because I'm the youngest I need to look up to my elders and obey no matter what?

Sorry for incoherent rambling, I'm on day 3 of a fever and now I'm also in tears, but my SO is at work and my one friend is sleeping, so I just didn't want to feel alone in this moment. I know I'm not crazy, but they're sure trying their hardest to make me think I am.

EDIT: And I just noticed posts from the book of faces, where the paternal grandmother apparently brought DD to go see my mom, Brother1, and his wife during the Saturday visit. It just helps make me feel like I'm the crazy one, when they're all looking so happy yet they treat me how they do. And I have no control over this. Paternal grandma won't listen to anything I say, she also thinks my mother is always right and that I don't know how to parent. DD is 6. Now that my mom has apparently been acting all sweet with her, what do I even do about this? I'm afraid my own daughter will end up thinking I'm unreasonably bitter to her sweet old grandma.  What if she resents me for not speaking to my mom?

So many complications because of previously established relationships with DD. At least when DS is born in 2.5 more months, he'll have a clean slate. His bio-dad is my SO, so there won't be any court disputes or other JNs butting in. At least SO is fully supportive of my decisions regarding toxic family members."
855,"My SO and I finally went to the courthouse to make things official on Friday. We have been together nearly 4 years, lived together 3.5, and have an almost 6 month old. So, nothing really changed for us- it just felt good to finally make it legal.

We knew we couldn't have a ceremony without drama. My MIL has burned bridges with me, my mother, SO's father, and SO's step mom. My dad also can't stand my MIL after only meeting her once and would rather not be in the same room as her. All things considered, we opted for the courthouse and were completely happy with that choice as we are both pretty low-key and it was cost effective as well. SO had told his mother that we planned to get married this year on one occasion and on a separate occasion told her we would probably go to the courthouse early October (this is insignificant and shouldn't *really* matter, but I'm including this anyways to show the level of this woman's bullshit).

So we go down to the courthouse on Friday and SO says he will probably tell his family on Sunday or Monday so he can actually enjoy the weekend with no drama. Well, as always, MIL must of sensed joy in the air. She ascended from hell once again and breathed her wrath of negativity on our life. She sends SO a text Friday night ""So when's the wedding?"" I swear to God this woman has our house bugged or something. He decides to give her a call to say we went to the courthouse that day and after a small back and forth of telling him how disappointed everyone in the family is going to be and that he needs to call all of them and apologize *she hangs up the phone on him.*

She later texts him about how hurt she is and acted like she was blindsided- even though she literally sent the ""so when's the wedding"" text and was more concerned with thinking my parents may have been there as witnesses. She was **shocked** we didn't ask her to be there. Mind you this woman has called me ""a sorry excuse for a woman"", ""a liar"", ""a brain-washer"", etc... ***WHY THE ACTUAL FUCK WOULD WE WANT HER THERE.***

Now, something to know about my MIL is she has a fake Facebook persona. She has literally called my SO and called me a horrible, mean person and told him I have him brainwashed and then hopped onto my facebook page 20 mins later and commented ""so cute!"" on a pic of my baby.

So, after her little temper tantrum on Friday she hopped on my Facebook and commented ""Welcome to the family &lt;3"" on my relationship update?????

Today I couldn't help myself. I got on Facebook and went to her page. Low and behold she has been posting bullshit just as I suspected she would be:

""The family you marry into is just as important as the person you marry.""

""Being a mom is without a doubt the greatest joy of my life. ...regardless 🥰 Loving your kids means all the time. Grown and until I die!!! Noone can take that from me ❤ My love is non wavering!""

""The best revenge is to move on, get over it, and continue to succeed. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer.""

I know she paints the story that I ruined her and SO's relationship and that I am a horrible person and so mean to her- even though I literally don't speak to her. She literally creates drama with me, I don't respond, and then she just stews in it by herself. But what the actual fuck is wrong with this woman??????

Also what the fuck is wrong with me? I have her facebook posts blocked from showing on my main feed but I still search it out after she has an outburst- WHY AM I LIKE THIS."
856,"I don't like my ILs, more specifically my mil. Mostly due to her behavior once my first was born. I had another account with all the history but it was a lot of the usual baby rabies, baby grabbing, entitlement, she's the victim stuff. 

Anyways I never confronted them over it, but did majorly change our relationship. Before kids we lived 10 mins away, saw them 2x a week, following mils lead for ALL holidays to the point my dhs ahole cousin commented how she forgot I even had family I was there so much...a lot of it was my fault, I wanted to be liked and have that good relationship with the ILs. 

Now after all the poo hit the fan, we live across the country (job move), see them every 4 months, no more overnight guests so they get a hotel, they visit around my kids nap schedule, we don't ever drive anywhere in the same car anymore. I went to a few therapy sessions, confirmed ILs were a problem in marriage. DH and I went to one session, confirmed ILs were a problem. DH is now mostly on board with my way of thinking. Still has moments of justno himself because he hates confrontation.

Except every time they come I hate it. I'm not trying to stop them from having a relationship so I'm down for a few hours a weekend every few months, my kid goes crazy, he's 2 and we don't see much family, he loves it. But I get so anxious, fight with my husband before and after, buy things for the house we don't really need, spend the days leading up on this sub getting anxious d remembering things. I just don't know how to ""get over their actions"". No DH isn't telling me to, but I feel like why can't I let it go, or live on without ""hating"" seeing them? 

Part of me wants to lay out all the time stuff they have done to me. Part of me wants to just move on. It's tense when they are here and I don't know if it's just me or everyone feels it. I think it's mutual. Mil tries too hard and is just too much, fil is all tense because mil doesn't get her way or feelings are hurt. I don't enjoy them and don't know how to learn to like them or live disliking someone I see multiple times a year. 

I mean they are selfish people, they've done some stuff, but nothing I consider NC worthy. And yet because of how I feel I'm so torn. I want my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents, but I also dislike my kids liking them? Because I feel like it's unfair my kids should like someone who's been so shitty to me at times? I feel possessive over my kids simply because how entitled they are. I'm not like this with any other family. Does anyone ever feel like this? How do you get over it?"
857,"My JNMIL wore white to my wedding...

I thought maybe it was a Hispanic tradition as my D(ear)H is Hispanic...it’s not. She just ignored my request that she wear grey or silver.

DH doesn’t understand why I’m upset about it."
858,"Edit: Wow thanks for the Silver! I really appreciate it and all the wonderful comments!  



Obligatory on mobile, sorry for errors note.

My MostlyYesMIL is coming out to stay with us at the end of the month (she lives a few states away). I have my complaints about her (might talk about them at some point), but otherwise we get along pretty well. She’s a decent houseguest: she doesn’t make many messes, doesn’t really meddle in anything, and her visits are short and spaced apart nicely. So I don’t mind her visits.

Know who does mind?

My mom.

She doesn’t hate my in-laws, she’s friendly with them on the chances that they’re around each other. But their visits or plans interfere with hers, it’s like they’re the most selfish people on earth.

My mom called me recently trying to set up a visit. Unfortunately the time she wanted was around the same time as my MIL’s visit, and I told her it didn’t work for us, as MIL would be visiting (I don’t mind even having them together as guests (MIL acts as a buffer), it’s just a tight fit and I know mom doesn’t like to share). My mom freaked out.

JNMom: “She’s coming out again?!”

Me: “Yeah...that’s going to happen sometimes.”

JNMom: “God she was just out here!”

Me: *trying to remember when MIL was out here* “I don’t think so, but that doesn’t matter-“

JNMom: “God, she’s so selfish!”

Me: “MIL’s kids are here (in this state), she wants to see them. DH also wants to see his mom.”

JNMom: “Well-“

Me: “Also her granddaughter (my DD), she wants to see her too.”

JNMom: “But she just saw her!”

Me: *Blinks at non-logic* “...You just saw her.”

JNMom: “What?”

Me: “You literally just saw her two weeks ago.”

JNMom: “Yeah? So what-”

Me: “By your logic, you can’t see DD.”

JNMom: “WHAT?! NO!”

Me: “I’m going off what YOU said. MIL was “just here, just saw her”, you were actually “just here, just saw her.” So by YOUR line of logic-“

JNMom: Sputters out a frazzled “WAITNO”

Then it devolved into her trying to figure out what to say, and me waiting for her. I took pity on her, mostly because I’ve had my fun (and probably be amused about it for awhile afterwards) and I don’t like to be on the phone with her long and she was stalled out.

Me: “You can visit a different time. The weekend before MIL comes out works better.”

JNMom: “...Yeah. I-uh ok.”

The call was pretty subdued after that, and ended fairly soon after that conversation. She might stew on it and try again, but she never wins the “But I want my plans and only my plans” fights. I usually have to do a “Compromise or get nothing” conversation with her.

This was fun for me."
859,"Town Crier, my MIL is planning her shotgun JP wedding to creepy BF. She texted my husband a few days ago asking if (random Friday a few weeks from now at 2pm) would be a “good time for him.” He said “if you’re asking if I can go, then no. I’m working.” This is true, he is working ... as are most people on a Friday afternoon. Last night she called him asking about the Friday after the first one - again at 2pm (this woman is astonishingly stupid). My husband AGAIN said no, he is working, he can’t come. 

THEN Town Crier goes “well would you even come if you could?” DH said “I might, but it doesn’t matter because I can’t come on either of the days you asked about.” Town Crier got pissy and said he should be more supportive. DH got mad right back and said “why are you even marrying him? Do you see the way he treats people, the way he treats me and OP? You want me to be supportive of that?” Town Crier said “well he treats ME with respect” (note that she didn’t even say she loved him which, you know, is usually reason #1 to marry someone, but what do I know. Also apparently it doesn’t matter that he’s disrespectful to anyone else as long as he “respects” HER *eyeroll*) Anyway, DH said “that’s nice that you think he treats you with respect, but he didn’t treat my wife with respect. An apology is owed. And if he respects you so much, why does he talk FOR you? You used to be able to speak for yourself.” Town Crier said “well he was trying to protecttttt meeeee” and DH shut her down immediately by saying “protect you from what, the false information YOU fed him about us?” Town Crier avoided that question altogether and said “well BF thinks he’s not welcome anymore and he’s not sure if he still has your blessing for us to get married.”

My sexy, amazing, newly shiny-spined DH said “it’s about time he noticed something besides himself. He’s not welcome, and he’s right, he doesn’t have my blessing. You do what you want, but he won’t be coming around my family. I have to go, DD needs her bottle.” AND HUNG UP 😍

I sat there and heard both sides of the conversation (Town Crier has a “phone voice” where she talks as if she’s yelling through Dixie cups and string so it’s not hard to overhear her). I asked DH if he was okay and he said “actually, yeah. If she has the presence of mind to even ask if I’d go to their stupid wedding AND throws in that BF thinks he’s not welcome, she knows damn well that there are issues and she’s choosing not to solve or even address them. I don’t have time for this. They can go get married and do whatever but I’m not part of it. She’ll realize what she’s done when DD is never allowed over at their house and we don’t see them except at big family gatherings.”

DH is going to be treated well tonight ..."
860,"Throwaway, D(ear?)H knows my main account.

I(25F) have been married to my DH(27) for about 2 years, together for five. I grew up with the advice that if he loves and respects his mom, he will love and respect you. Well that’s great, because DH and JN?MIL would talk on the phone for at least an hour *every single day*. I thought it was adorable at first, until I started spending more time with his family.

While we have dinners at his parents house, he usually doesn’t acknowledge that I exist. I will crack a few jokes or try and engage in conversation, but I am met with silence and just a pity smile from D(amn)H. It gets very disheartening whenever I go over with him, because I know the three hours we will spend there will be hell for me. I have brought it up with him about paying more attention to me and acknowledging me while with his family, but I feel like we come back to square one after three or so visits. 

Now to the story of MIL, I’ll call her Kathy, she seems to put me down in subtle and quiet ways. I just finished a term with a company, and am waiting to hear back from a job soon. Her shots at me include “Well, we all have to get through the loser stage in our life! Ha-ha, just kidding. Even I was unemployed... when I was 15!” Thanks for your input, chatty Kathy. She also makes little digs at me that DH will always be her baaaaby and I will never live up to his standards. I let it go for the sake of my husband. We recently all went on a trip to my home province and she called it a Hick Town, and that I could never move back here because I could never make a living. Or she would say how she could never live in a beat up, ghetto place like this. I talked to DH about it, and he thinks Hick Town was meant as a compliment because I stupidly searched on Urban Dictionary what a Hick Town was, and it [came up as this.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=Hick%2bTown&amp;amp=true) Now we all know that she did not mean it as a compliment.

During that trip, DH and I rented a car and they had rented an RV for all of us to sleep in. So, throughout the course of the trip.. Kathy took it upon herself to give up the front seat to anyone else that she thought needed it. I get it, DH’s brother and father are broader than I am... but girl, if I’m paying 700$ for this car rental, I’m getting that damn front seat on this 8 hour day trip. 

So now that was the backstory of her subtle bitchiness that my DH doesn’t really see. It’s frustrating. My most recent issue, is the calls between them. My family moved across the country and I see them about twice a year, this will be relevant I promise. Every single day, Chatty Kathy calls DH at 9pm to catch up on their day. Sometimes the call will last 30-60 minutes, other days DH cuts it short because I started showing him it annoyed me. Tonight, shit hit the fan. After early thanksgiving dinner at his parents tonight, I was reminded again how he ignores me in front of his family. So we left and got in to a heated argument... and she called. This sent me off the deep end, I mean we just all saw each other twenty minutes ago. She wanted to talk about supper *next week*.

I admit I shouldn’t have lost my cool, but they talk every day or every second day. She treats him as a girl friend who she updates on the local gossip about coworkers and BIL’s flavour of the week (he has a different girlfriend every month). It’s very annoying to me, because he works until 6pm and we are in bed by 9pm. She calls, and they talk until her hearts content. He is very non-confrontational and he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings by cutting the calls short or telling her to not call so much, which is what I want him to do. I tell him that we see his family once a week, therefore the phone calls every night are a bit much. He throws in my face that I call my mom every day while he’s at work. I remind him that my family moved across the county to my home province last year and I see them twice a year, if that. Apples and oranges.

Am I the JustNO? The days go by so fast when he gets home from work, and he spends an hour every day talking about literally nothing of importance. Nothing that can’t wait until next weeks supper. I’m at my wits end, what should I do?"
861,"Hello All! It’s been a while. A little update on my last post. I was discussing how my MIL wanted to have her own little celebration with my son for his 7th birthday and I didn’t know if I was being petty or not because she claimed she couldn’t do it any other day. Well I held my ground and she was miraculously free a week later and went to the zoo with my son and DH. But they also took my 6 month old too. Probably BEC from me but I hated that she got to go to the zoo with my little one before I did because I was away working for a week. Ugh. 

Anyway, on to the current situation. I’ll try to be short. I promise this is about JNMIL and not DH but I want to tell the story through our conversation. Today my D(dumb in this situation)H texted me while I was on the way to pick the kids up from school and daycare after work and said:

DH: my mom asks that you let DS call her sometimes

Now he knows I am NC with his mom so I’m like WHAT?!

Me: are you not able to call with him on your days off? Or early before you leave for work on the weekend (he has to be to work at 11a Saturday and Sunday. Off Thursday and Fridays but his schedule rotates once a month so we never knew when he’ll be off). Is DS not your son as well?

DH: I’m at work most of the times, she asked if you could call with them sometimes. When I’m not there. 

Me: pls stop putting this stuff on me. You are very capable of calling your mother and keeping the relationship between them if you want. Does she need to speak to them/DS everyday? If not, your two days off is enough time for you to have a quick call with your mother and son. 

DH: you win. I understand. 

Now I’m totally confused at this so when he comes home I ask him more details. Come to find out, she’s badgering him saying “why doesn’t AGirlinTheCityy call me to check in on me? I’m your mother she should be doing this” blah blah blah blah. I stop him and say why would I be calling her after everything that went down this year? I will NOT be speaking with your mom and stop trying to make me as I am not playing these games with you anymore. He apologizes and that’s that. But it just solidifies how delusional she is. 

1st of all, we are not on good terms, 2nd, it’s not my job to check on a person who wishes ill intentions upon me. She has this thinking in her head that since she’s my MIL I must respect her and be concerned about her well being. She’s said this many times AND on a voicemail that my husband needs to put me in check and make me respect her no matter what she’s said to me in the past. I’ve recently decided that I don’t care who you are, if you’re toxic, you won’t be in my life. I’ve spent years being forced into family relations that I don’t want per my own mother who is a retired JNMom (currently a JY but has relapses sometimes). 

Honestly, this issue is not HORRIBLE compared to past things she has done and said but it just pissed me off. The reason my DH tried to put this on me is because he’s using me as a shield for his mom as he hates speaking to her too most of the time but she’s instilled the thinking that “I’m your mom so you must care about me no matter what” into his head. The one (of 2) daughter that she actually claims doesn’t even speak to her. Maybe she should work on trying to mend that relationship because there is no way, no how, that it will ever happen with me. 

Am I being too harsh guys?

Edit to add: thanks everyone. After reading your comments I realize I’m not being too harsh. I just sometimes start getting soft and thinking well maybe it won’t be that bad but looking back, every single time I’ve said it won’t be that bad with this woman, something bad happens or is said. She’s never said anything bad or done anything to her many grandkids but I can imagine it’ll happen at some point. If it’s with my DS or DD I’ll handle immediately. If it’s with her others, that’ll still give me enough reason to have them go completely NC with her as well. She’s already super limited with her contact with them. I’m pretty sure my husband won’t take on this role with calling her."
862,"So when I found out about the threat to hire a PI to find us I called my sister to update her (and get another perspective on the matter). Well I talked to her recently and she told me that my parents had gotten a call from someone asking for any information relating to me or my husband. Luckily this was left as a message on the answering machine and they deleted it as soon as my sister filled them in on the insanity.

DH blocked his dad on Messenger and deleted the convo, AND double checked his blocked list and updated it for every family member he could think of.

I was told that Irene went into the hospital soon after and needs angioplasty and her kidneys are failing. When I told DH he simply said ""I guess she should have taken better care of herself.""  I'm pretty sure AIL thought by finding out about her health problems he would break NC. He didn't, and I haven't heard from her since.

We are cautiously optimistic that maybe this whole thing is over for the time being."
863,"Do you guys have situations where the JN wants to see either only YOU or your SO? I'm currently busy like constantly nowadays (job, job hunting(shoutout to that), junior year of college, puppy and just trying to live) and my JNmom has been nothing but coldhearted and rude since she married my Just Whatever SF. 
Shes helping me with college which is fine but after this semester she may not even have to do that (especially after I clear things up with financial aid). I'll hopefully have a better full time job and finish up with two degrees so I dont have to see her again! It sucks because she used to be my best friend but I guess her new husband and family is better. 
She gets pissed that I refuse to go to her house without someone else there. Any advice on how to deal with her being angry that I dont have time to help mommy dearest with her pc issues only to be then pushed aside after? 

I feel bad that I sound so harsh typing this but I'm kind of pissed off at her. Sorry for the early morning rants!"
864,"This is a super old story, in fact, i cant remember how old we were as we started dating when i was 15 and this had to be 2 or 3 years into the relationship and he is a year older than me.

So dh(bf at the time) and his family celebrate new year as their big holiday and dont do christmas at all. Christmas eve is the big thing in our family. So the first year dh was gonna celebrat christmas eve with us and i would celebrate new years with his family.

I tell him very early on christmas eve is a big deal for us. We make a whole buffet, watch christmas movies, trim the tree(a tradition from when we were little to keep kids occupied on the eve) and it would usually go rather late. I arrange to pick him up early, like around 2. Well he texts saying he wont be ready til 4ish because his mother is having him run errands. Annoying but w/e. Get there around 4 and she keeps having him do stuff til 530. Yes they knew we were there so me and my mother felt absolutely disrespected as she kept having new chores to ""quickly do"". So we didnt get to my house til apmost 6 and didn't get most of the stuff done that we wanted to do. I was pissed, then at 8 she texts him saying she wants him home. Note we told her it was a late night and she never commented on a curfew(legit if she had said ""be home by 9"" once he was kept passed 5 i woulds told him to forget it). She ends up picking him up at 830 or 9. But she expected me to stay over for new years overnight. I dont even remember if i went to new years that year after that. But i learned early i had to fight for everything. Even to this day if i didnt love him (prior to dd) i believed if i didnt love him i woulda left him just bc of his mom.

We were teens at the time, even if dh was 18 he didnt really have adult moments til into the 20s, and because i fought for them every step of the way.

Honestly, this christmas story still annoys me 12 or 13 years later bc it honestly was a moment i questioned if i could deal with her and if i cared about him enough. It also ruined the holiday for me. It was supposed to be our first holidays really celebrating together so our first moment is forever tainted. I dont harp on it now too much but when i revisit some of our lives it comes up."
865,"I need to make a full on story time post to vent about my narcissistic MIL because the stories and my stress are just never-ending and I need a damn outlet and some solidarity.

But for now, I need to vent about her behavior at the birth of our first child in April. Quick preface: My husband (boyfriend at the time) is starting to see the error in his mother's ways, but has lived a life of appeasing her and has honestly seemed near brainwashed at times.

Anywho, I had said I didn't want any visitors while I was laboring aside from my parents and (begrudgingly) that MIL could stop in. She took it upon herself to invite my husbands sister, his nephew, and grandmother as well. So, while I was laboring (and things were going TERRIBLY) my boyfriend was receiving texts about how he needed to come out and visit with the family (this is exactly why I didn't want visitors until after bubs was here). During the time MIL was in the room with me while I was laboring she made the entire situation about herself somehow- screaming about a spider on the wall, talking about her labor, telling me how much worse it was going to get.

But to the meat and potatoes of this story: flash forward to after the awful 24 hours of labor, hour of pushing, and inevitable c section. Bubs is finally here! He was going back and forth from the NICU as I had to be induced at 37 weeks for choleostasis and then got an infection during labor that we both had to be treated for. We are in the hospital room with my boyfriends mom and grandmother when they start talking about my boyfriends sister coming to visit. This is Monday- On Saturday Bf's sister was ""so ill"" with the stomach flu that her husband was asking for prayers for her on Facebook. BF and I had already vaguely talked about this with a nurse who said anyone who had been sick shouldnt hold baby for at least a week. I agreed, boyfriend seemed to ignore the advice as to appease the family and not cause drama. So, at this point I'm told that she is on her way to the hospital. I said she could see bubs (against my better judgement) but that she WAS NOT holding my 1 day old baby after just being sick. Boyfriend and I go back and forth in front of his mom and she interjects to raise her voice at me and say ""I never said she couldn't hold the baby"". I was completely shocked because 1. who in their right mind thinks someone coming off of illness should be at the hospital with a newborn? and 2. Who yells at someone who just had a fucking baby?

All the 3.5 years of not saying shit to this narcissistic asshole/ hormones welled up inside of me and I finally raised my voice back at her and said ""for once, this isn't about you or your family."" She then looked at me like she was going to literally punch me- like gritted teeth, crazy eyes as I lay there in my giant diaper. Boyfriend ushered her out of the room as he saw where it was going and she went into the waiting area and made a bigger scene. Saying ""how dare I say this isn't about them"" ""boyfriend will never be close with his family as long as im in the picture"". She then hypes the entire family up on whatever twisted version of the story she came up with.

I am visibly upset by all of this. My nurses take notice and end up hearing about the entire situation/ see the scene in the waiting area. After hearing about my boyfriends sisters recent stomach flu they say she absolutely does not need to even be in the room with the baby. Well, at this point MIL makes her return to my room to apologize and say that boyfriends sister is there. We then inform her that sis actually can't be in the room as orders of the charge nurse. MIL flips out, yells at me again and calls me a liar, yells at my BF that ""He has rights too?"" Goes into lobby and tells the whole family that I am a liar and that the baby was on antibiotics anyway so it wouldn't matter (complete idiocy). Bf tells them again how this is the nurse's orders and his mother continues to say the nursing staff was lying for me because I asked them to and that I was giving bf no fatherly rights. The whole family is pissed at us and BF spends the evening receiving awful, drama filled texts from family. Meanwhile, I was told no more visitors for the rest of the day as it was all such a SCENE.

The only apology I have gotten is that she is sorry for ""the timing"" BUT I was in the wrong too and then a long list of all the ""things Ive done to her and how i've hurt her"".

She has since pulled numerous other stunts but I just had to vent about this one in particular.

Edit 1: almost forgot to share that immediately following her exit from the hospital she didnt miss the opportunity for likes on facebook! she hopped right on and posted candid (horrible) pics of me and bf with the baby and pics of her with the baby and literally captioned them ""what a wonderful experience meeting little ----"""
866,"Long time lurker first time poster. On Mobile. 

This story is about the woman who was almost my MIL. The engagement and relationship ended a while ago so no advise is needed. This is just something that I need to vent about because some people make me feel crazy that I was hurt by things this woman did while I was with her son.

This story takes place on Thanksgiving at the house of a dear family friend. 

Now this family friend has a wife who loves to cook. I’m talking three hams and two turkeys for all the people they have over. Guests bring sides and the day after leftovers are a whole separate feast. 

Now my ex and I had been together for a while, and were about to get a place together so I wanted him to meet the family friends who were basically like family. He spoke to his mother first and then said he would come. 

I told him he could bring a side if he wanted but as it were there was going to be enough food to feed a small army so he did not need to feel obligated. 

We get to the house and settle, I have a drink and my first plate of food and go back for seconds while Ex is still picking at his first plate. 

I check to see if he is feeling well as he typically had a rather large appetite. 

As it turns out his Mother had made him food to eat before he had come over. Even though I explained he should come hungry.  

This cemented the feeling I had that his mother had not liked me. 

He said she had just wanted to take care of him. To make sure he ate. It was just because she cared.

Please note this was a sandwich and snack food. It is not as though he had a few bites of a Thanksgiving meal with his family.

I pointed out this was her all but saying my friends, family, and I were not going to feed him well enough. That her food was better than ours and he should have that just to make sure he was not hungry. 

We did not talk much the rest of the night and that was when I realized that Ex was not able to stand up to his Mother."
867,"Hey, my dudes, it's me, the gal whose MIL tried to make me skype in to my own wedding shower and threw a hissy fit about the wildebeest-level migration she'd have to take to come see our new home. The wedding HAPPENED, first of all, thank goodness. But I promised you all drama, and boy did Skype Swipe (thanks for the name, y'all!) deliver. 

First of all, she told all of DH's relatives that the wedding started at 4:30 when it actually started at 4. We managed to get the word out that this was WRONG, but a few people still walked into Mass half an hour late. Whoops for them, I guess. Minor thing. 

Second, the dresses: I had put on the invites that the wedding was strictly a dressy-casual event. Because the reception was a lovely little picnic, the whole floor-length-gowns thing just didn't make much sense, and plus we had swing dancing at the reception and that's tough to do in formal wear. For example... My mom, who has her own JustNO, came in a lovely, knee-length lace purple dress. She looked stunning. MY dress was mermaid style, white, but had painted-looking flowers meandering up the skirt to about knee height, so it wasn't your usual poofy monstrosity. My bridesmaids, friends, grandparents, all came dressed to jitterbug. Skype Swipe, on the other hand, came in a floor-length column-shaped sage green FORMAL EVENING GOWN. So she looked a little ridiculous. But not as ridiculous as she was going to look when dinner began. 

Now, to set the stage, I planned the catering for this shindig MONTHS ago. My mom's sorority sister and close friend, Cindy, owns a lovely catering business in the town where DH and I are now living. Obviously, I decided to use Cindy as my caterer, because friendship=low prices and also I knew the money would go toward paying for the break-dance lessons she obviously gives to her kids (you should have seen them at the reception, it was incredible to watch.) I picked picnic fare to eat (pulled pork, corn, green beans, fresh rolls, homemade baked beans). For drinks, I decided to pay homage to my Hispanic heritage and have lemonade, water, jimaica (a hibiscus drink) and horchata (a cinnamon-rice drink). Cindy said that she would take care of all of it. So when Skype Swipe asked what I had picked for food and drinks, I told her. 

Cue CBF. 

""NOBODY is going to want to drink that stuff! It's too ethnic! Nobody will know what it is! Rice drink? Sounds DISGUSTING."" 

All I remember saying was that I thought people (read: her gringo-ass family) were going to enjoy trying something new! And hey, Skype Swipe, you have diabetes, so these ""ethnic"" drinks are lower in sugar and will be healthier for you! She scowled. I thought that was the end of it until the night before the wedding, while I'm helping to do the final touches on the reception venue, and I see her and her husband carting in bottle after bottle after bottle of soda. There were dozens of them. They must have spent a few hundred dollars on freaking soda. I was horrified but, to my shame, said nothing because I was fighting with the tablecloths. Skype Swipe looked like the cat that caught the canary, so proud of herself. The next night, the reception begins. Cindy asks why there's soda there, I just say my MIL didn't get the memo, so put the soda to one side and put the drink containers to the other. Skype Swipe is in her overly fancy dress, looking over the proceedings as my 200 guests partook exclusively of her soda, eschewing my ""disgusting,"" ""ethnic"" drinks for her sugary, diabetes-inducing goop. 

Except they fucking weren't. 

Everyone, even the gringo side of the family, was gulping down the horchata and jimaica like Robinson Crusoe finding a spring on his desert island. Cindy had to refill the horchata four or five times. Even the lemonade didn't drop as fast as the horchata. People are flopping off the dance floor, exhausted, and the ""ethnic"" drinks actually quench their thirst. Huh! Who thought! Who could have guessed? Skype Swipe began an epic sulk, leaving the reception early because she claimed she had suddenly gotten a UTI (which was mysteriously gone the next day, hm). DH and I visited their house two days later to watch Skype Swipe and her husband load up all those **completely unused** soda bottles into their car to try and return them to the grocery store. They filled the van so full that they had to give several bottles to us to carry. 

Play wedding bitch games, win wedding bitch prizes, Skype Swipe."
868,"Since Christmas is coming up I want to share about last year's experience. 
So my future SIL and BIL live across the country which results in rare visits. JNMIL was so excited and planned some gingerbread fun for her grandbaby.

 Well.. she skipped Christmas lunch and most of the unwrapping because she spent 6+ hours baking ginger bread, mixing colors for the icing, and organizing the candy... No time spent with family. Finally everything was ready.. it's freaking 8pm and people are getting tired. I decided to stick with grandbaby so FH can have some fun with his brother and SIL. Grandbaby is attached to my hip (yay!), so I had fun myself. Until JNMIL began controlling everything. She had plans and we needed to follow it. Poor girl was trying to make her own gingerbread men but JNMIL would stop her because a child's work is messy and everything had to be perfect. I honestly did not expect this even from her. I thought a 60yr old woman would understand a kid doesn't care for perfection. 

JNMIL left for an hour to make more icing....So i decided it was time for grandbaby to have a smile on her face. I let grandbaby make everything however she wanted. During this time grandbaby asked me, ""Why is Grandma different?"" Ugh. Coming from a five year old. I had no idea how to answer. 

We made little ugly gingerbread men and a horribly designed house that could barely stand. But guess what??? Grandbaby had a great time. She loved her work. Then..... JNMIL comes in, freaks out, and tears our work apart because it didn't follow her plan.. Seriously. She took the gingerbread's candy decorations and wiped the icing clean. Grandbaby was SO confused and hurt. I could not watch it any longer so I found her mother to oversee everything. FH and I found out the next day that the house was finished at midnight! SIL said grandbaby just watched the entire time. JNMIL was trying to teach a 5 yr old how to do intricate decorating. I'm not sure why SIL and BIL stayed so long. I think they were still interacting with other family while JNMIL went full crazy. 

The family came from across the country to visit for 3 days out of the entire year and this is how JNMIL wanted to spend time with her grandbaby. Can anyone say psycho? I'm gonna plan something creative for her this year and let her do whatever she wants. :) I can't wait to see her excitement, and JNMIL's eye twitch from a child's art."
869,"So, some quick backstory about my MIL. In the beginning, I was the white girl that accidentally got pregnant and was ruining her son's life. When he son's life was not, in fact, ruined, it didn't stop her from feeling that way. When we lost our firstborn, it barely made a blip on the radar for her or my FIL. We nearly literally came to blows at one point. 

However, after a particularly rough fight with them wherein they accused be of faking an eating disorder to cover up drug use and being a bad influence by getting their son on drugs as well, I went full NC. 

I didn't have a neat-o acronym for it at the time, I just decided I was under no obligation to subject myself to their bullshit. I spent four years not hearing a peep from them. My husband didn't cut off contact, but he did set some rules and boundaries, never going over there unless other family was over, and never leaving our son (second born) alone with them.

Shortly before Christmas the year before last, I got individual heartfelt apologies for the way they treated me, via email. They'd spent the last three years in counseling, together and separately, and realized they had treated me badly based on the way they assumed I was raised (which they weren't actually that wrong about, but I defied my upbringing). They invited me to join them in therapy, and hoped that we could find a way to all be a family, comfortably.

On to the current: 

I'm 32ish weeks pregnant with our third child, the first granddaughter. I'm over the moon. My husband is scared he will spoil our daughter like his dad spoiled his sister, but also excited. 

We have had a name in mind for this baby since before we ever conceived her. It's relatively unisex, as much of it would just be changed a little based on the sex of the baby. It's also a very heavy name, and damnably unique. We decided early to name the baby after the ""circle the wagons""/""shirt off their back"" family members on all sides. So she's named after my GGGrandfather, and both of my husband's grandmothers. With so many names, we decided to base the order on what seemed the most attractive to say/hear out loud. 

This ended up being (GGGrandpa) (PatGran) (MatGran) (Lastname).

My FIL also has two middle names, which I didn't think would ever be relevant to what I decided to name my child, but here we are.

When we told my in-laws our daughter's name, we first got exactly the reaction we expected; ""isn't that a *boy* name?!?!""

But after my FIL left the room, my MIL asked us if we would reverse the order of the middle names, as she was worried her mother's name would get excluded on official paperwork. Which initially I understood. 

But then it hit me. 

She's asking us to ascertain that *her* mother's name is included in vital records, at the risk that FIL's mother's name will be excluded. I get not wanting a something special to get messed up by bureaucracy, but her primary reasoning was that the second of my FIL's middle names gets excluded on things like his military paperwork, SS card, etc. She knows this is a risk and has knowingly elected to risk the exclusion of the other grandmother.

Maybe this isn't as shitty as it came across to me, but my normal meter and sense of etiquette are really... colorful.

I'd be happy to hyphenate, if it helps, but I just think that whole move was a little douche-y."
870,"MIL isn’t coming to hlep before the wedding until Friday afternoon now! YAY!!!! I mean, I’m sure she’ll still manage to piss us off in the few hours we see her before the big day, but it’s a huge relief knowing I won’t have to deal with her for several DAYS over the lead-up. Apparently she has some maintenance jobs at her holiday house - jobs that have been there for 10+ years - but NOW is the time to do them. I’m wondering if she’s just salty because of her “visit” last week and is now realising our world doesn’t revolve around her. 

She’s also managed to cause drama with other family members that will likely carry on into the wedding reception (think along the lines of a toddler tantrum and line dropping shit like “DoNt EvEr sPeAk tO mE AgAiN!”). FDH rang his dad last night and made it VERY clear that if there’s even a hint of drama, MIL and other family member will be kicked out. FDH has no patience for this bullshit (finally!!!!!) and it was so nice to see him set that boundary.

MIL also rang me yesterday asking if I know of any hairdressers that can do her hair before the wedding. (We are a few short days out, mind you. And we live in a rural area with no hairdressers open on weekends). I got the feeling she was trying to weasel her way into getting ready with us - which was a huge hell no from me - so I gave her a couple numbers and said they *might* be available, good luck. 

I’m just so happy, I had to share! I’ve been dreading this week for months and had it all planned out that I’d make myself busy, not answer the door to her etc. and I don’t have to now!"
871,"This story happened when MIL was living with us.

So child is an very unfit 8 year old boy, he can't even carry a 30 pound bag of rice or walk the full block. He is my SO younger brother.

My puppy, known as fluff, at the time was about 5 months and 30-40 pounds. At this point in time he had just learned this new trick call ""I'm not interested, oh wait, I'm am"". It's a trick where he waits until the very last minute and then trys to dart towards whatever he's intrested in. In my defense it was the main reason only certain people were allowed to walk him.

.................................
Now on to the story. 

The day before. (You can skip to the next day if you want its just extra information) 

Me, SO, and child, were taking Fluff for a training walk. Child never been on one with us since I didn't want Fluff distracted.

It was a walk where the main focus wasn't walking or tiring out Fuff but actually working on manners.

He did so good that day, minimum pulling, one or two jumps, etc.

Child: I want to take over.

Tactlessderina: Sorry bud, Fluff gets too excited easily and I don't want something to happen. Not even your brother can control this massive beast. If you want, you can help me hold the lease. You will have to hold my hand through :).

Child: No I want to walk him by myself, it looks fun. I can control fluff.

Tactlessderina: Child he's only listening right now because it's me, as I have been the only one training him. If SO took him now he would go nuts like he did when he frist got out of the car. (SO verbally agreed here BTW) He's not calm or tired out, he's just waiting for an opportunity. (Fluff is very smart and known to do this.) If you want to walk a dog you so bad take Mdog out when we get home. I'm sure SO would love some brother time as well.

Child then threw a fit, and I told him he was welcome to sit in the car until we we're done. It shut him up real fast.
.........................................

The next day, Saturday.

So at 9 am, we get woken up by MIL slaming the door. So I go downstairs to, in her words, ""start an unnecessary fight, and bully her"".

As I'm going downstairs I noticed fluff hasn't jumped me yet, werid... oh hey look a wild MDog (MIL's dog, check post history for more info.)

So I go to confront her, she yells at me and tells me I should wake up at a regular time like the rest of the world and Mdog can do whatever she wants. 

I remind her that we work 2nd shift, and Mdog had her rights revoked when she attacked Fluff and chased my cat.

I ask her where Fluff is since I didn't see him and her dog is running around the house unattended. I was worried.

MIL: Oh well, child is ACTUALLY paying ATTENTION to him and took him for a WALK. Something you should do every once in a while.

Tactlessderina: Yeah well thats something I did YESTERDAY. I also told CHILD he wasn't allowed to walk fluff for MULTIPLE reasons.(fire with fire people)

So I yelled upstairs for SO to get dressed and what was happening.

Thankfully, SO does get his shit together here and actually yells at MIL before darting outside.

MIL continues to b*tch at me about how child can handle Fluff and I should have trained my 5 month old puppy to walk on the lease properly. I just eye her.

So not even five mins later, they come back.

Apparently Child did lose his hold on Fluff and almost got them hit by a car.

So for those who don't know certain breeds need to wear a harness. Fluff is one of those breeds. Fluff does have a collar, but it is mostly for his tags.

Well Fluff didn't have his harness on, he only had his collar. MIL doesn't believe in harness btw.

So what ended up happening was Fluff saw SO and he got excited, like we predicated. Fluff ended up dragging Child towards SO, and the middle of the road. Soon Fluff started to slip out of his collar, Child panicked and lost hold of the leash tumbling forward. Just as a car had drove passed. Thankfully no one was hurt.

Me and SO were pissed.

Oh but in MIL eyes it was because SO called Fluff and he got so excited he pulled free. It's SO's fault not childs. Now don't get her started on tactlessderina doesn't actually train fluff. (Child agreed)

I interrupted her hourly entitlement to explain that child was already told no by me. I also explain the collar issue, again to MIL. Regardless of me and SO Fluff still could have escaped or choked. Better SO then another Dog or truck.

MIL: Fluff just needs a choke collar to fix his pulling. You should give Child Fluff, he takes more care of him then you do. They llllooovvveeees each other. 
 
Tactlessderina: Good luck with that, I will be more then happy to call the cops if any of that happens. Child doesn't need MY dog he has his own(Mdog). He can walk and play with her, especially since she so well ""trained"" I'm sure she doesn't pull on walks. (She does btw)

MIL: Well its MY SONS dog, so you can't do that. MY SON won't let you. Mdog(8y) is too old to play with child, he needs Fluff. Mdog and fluff get along as well.

Tactlessderina: lol good for you. I get Fluffs papers and chip information ready then. Just so you know, MIL SO doesn't have his name on any of them, not even a vet bill. Unlike how I have only so much say with you living here right now since its 50/50. I have full say if you hurt or take MY dog. Fluff is 150% legally mine. As for Mdog and Fluff, they don't get along and I already made it clear. Mdog is not allowed around Fluff or in the wild of the house unsupervised. I took fluff and walked away.

The end. 

Her face was priceless BTW."
872,"This happened on Friday. I was so raging mad about the whole shituation that I couldn't type the words with out crying.

Last Friday Pandora announced to all her friends and family of the book of faces that against all the odds she was going to be a Nanny again. All her kidults did the not me thing. Her stepson did the not me thing. It didn't take a genius to work out who was left. So loads of people were congratulating her and my DP, totally ignoring me.

The thing is I'm not pregnant, and that's not for lack of trying. So her telling the world that I am has quite honestly broken my heart. Especially when I found out the reason why. Friday, Pandora asked if DP would be able to meet her for lunch the next day. DP in a truly spectacular moment of DUHHHHHHHHH said sorry can't OP has an ultrasound appointment.

So from that she has assumed that we were pregnant, and keeping it secret, which meant if she wanted to announce it first and steal the thunder, she had to act fast. But you know what they say about assuming Pandora - it makes and ass out of you and DP. The worst part is that the ultrasound was to see if there was anything physiologically that would be preventing me from getting pregnant, and to count cysts on my ovaries. And on Saturday I got to see the empty space that is my uterus, and it just rammed it all home.

I was to upset friday to deal with it, so told DP to fix it. His fix it was to comment that we are not pregnant. So Pandora told him to stop being so coy, its out of the bag, and to her friends that the scan is booked tomorrow. Then started texting and calling asking if she could come with us to see HERRRRR Baaaaaaaaaaby. At which point I broke down, and we switched off his phone. DP and I had a good long chat about him sharing my personal information with his mum, because even though it just slipped out, and he didn't mean to, this has caused a lot of pain. He bought me cake. I forgave him on the proviso he stopped being such a wet blanket when it came to his mother.

As for Pandora, she was still insisting to all and sundry that I was pregnant. Usually I let DP deal with her. Not my circus, not my monkey. This time however, I was feeling extra salty, as anyone who has had to have a transvaginal probing when they are not pregnant will tell you. So I commented.

""PandoraRealName. For the last time. I am not pregnant. Not sure why you think I am, but get it out of your head. I don't understand why you felt the need to publish this on facebook without asking DPrealname or I if it was true, then insisting we were lying. You have really hurt our feelings doing this. We thought you had learned after the last time you posted my private personal business on here. You are not involved in any of my medical decisions or any or our private life. Also, how narcissistic do you have to be to announce someone elses pregnancy before they do?""

The reactions were varied. Some calling me a liar and mean and defective (the usual Pandora cheerleaders and sycophants). Those weirdos were also sending private messages to both DP and I.

But a good number calling Pandora out for her behaviour. INCLUDING HER OWN MOTHER. Which almost immediately resulted in the post being removed. Her mum has called to apologise and ask if I'm okay.

Pandora is back in time out, and my parents are so angry at her that any chance of me having a proper wedding are quite literally shot to hell, not that I want one since we plan to elope when the time comes. Pandora has been posting a lot of memes about liars, and narcissism, and people being selfish. The most recent reads Its sickens me that there are people who can make up as much lies about someone and make themselves look so innocent and they destroy someones reputation all because they are jealous and pathetic and so many people believe them without finding out the truth. We are just eye rolling, and ignoring. We have no intention of speaking with her until she apologises, and for long enough to pass that we can make her look an idiot to the sycophants who still believe we are pregnant and hiding it. So far we have had 2 baby grows, a hat that says I love my nanny and a pair of booties posted through our letter box.

So that was my weekend, how were all of yours?

ETA: To all the commenters telling me to get off facebook (in spite of the no advice flair) - I get a lot of people hate social media and if not for the fact I have friends and family across multiple continents and timezones, I would ditch it. But if I did that, I would lose contact with a friend who lives in Alaska, friends who live in the Caribbean (lucky devils), and my great aunt in Australia. I would also lose more than 10 years worth of photos and memories, and worst of all comments and messages from my Nan, who passed away when I was 18. I dont use facebook to post my daily adventures like Pandora. I don't share memes and air my dirty laundry. My strict work social media policy prevents that. In fact I have probably made 7 or 8 posts in the last year, and never about personal things, usually funny observations like the time I saw a man eating a lettuce like you and i would an apple or the strange things my 4 year old niece comes out with. I dont have twitter or instagram, and never have. I only have 5 snapchat friends (none of whom is Pandora). I have her restricted on facebook to shield myself from her bullshit, but I'm far far stronger than anything she can throw at me, because in honesty, people I cared for far more have said far far worse things to me. I was in an abusive relationship from the age of 19 to 21, in which the man I loved tore parts of me to shreds, and his mother did the same. I actually find Pandora a sad pathetic excuse for a woman, and an even worse excuse for a mother, that even when shes spilling poison, it doesn't even scrape the sides of the barrel. I have had counselling for depression and anxiety, for pain, and for dealing with infertility. I have had a lot of experience with people like Pandora, who have such low self esteem they need to hurt others. I won't be deleting my facebook account. Pandora has been restricted, and is in time out for being a witch. When she apologises, she will be on an info diet. When I do fall pregnant, she will be the last to know. I am playing the long game with her now. She will find out about any child we may have via facebook, in a post following its birth with no real information, beyond hey guess what we had a baby. She will then be deleted, knowing nothing. For this recent act, her punishment is knowing nothing about her first biological grandchild."
873,"My SO has avoidant personality because he grew up with a narcissist father and a mother who has been extremely toxic to him (in my opinion).

I've recently learned that my own mother is a covert narcissist and I can see so clearly now how manipulative my MIL is too. She might not be a narc but she's constantly giving my SO very harsh critism and judgment. She's often making him feel less and he always has to be there to listen to her complain about her life. 
I understand we all have problems but she's putting an insane amount of pressure on him. I don't think he can truly rely on her for real motherly love or support... But I understand that it's hard for him to understand the level of toxicity.

My MIL even made my SO think that I was a gold digger. I've done everything in my power to be kind and positive torwards her but I'm rewarded with passive-aggressiveness most of the time. I know he doesn't tell me even 1% of the things she must tell him. I know this affects him greatly and just reinforces all those self harming thoughts he has about himself, which later come as an attack to me.

How can I help him feel better when I have another force out of my control pushing him down... If I say anything about his mother he gets defensive and I don't think I've been able to truly talk about the effect of her on him because... Because mothers are ""sacred"".

I just feel like anyway I approach this situation is just somehow wrong... I just don't want him to feel worse."
874,"Choosing ambivalent about advice because I do enjoy advice but we have it pretty handled (you never know when a good idea pops up!).

Prior to giving birth, both husband and I were researching a lot about SIDs. I really didn’t know too much about it, and when we took an infant care course, we were shocked when they recommend temperatures in the low 70's (\*F). Not a problem for us, we like things cold and it pushed us to replace our windows, which were technically closer to Saran Wrap then actual windows.

When I first got pregnant, my MIL kept bugging us about infant care books. Repeatedly, we said, “thanks, we don’t need one, we’ll be taking a parenting class” because I’m a learn by doing/classroom kind of person, plus my OB gave me a lot of recommendations, plus online resources. I don’t need to buy a fucking book that tells me how to breastfeed and change a diaper, lol. She kept insisting on her and us having a proper book so we all know what to do, so she’s “up to date” on information. Fine, get one, no one is stopping you, we said! So she finds a book, texts it to us and we pretty much respond with, “nice, glad you got it”. I then proceeded to get a super long text about how sorry she is for boundary stomping, that she’s just trying to heeeelllllppppp, that she’s trying to be a wonderful grannnnnnndma, that she wants to be prepared. I pretty much responded with, “What is going on that’s making you not chill out about this, all you have to do is relax and you’ll be a fine grandmother”. She responded with, if I recall correctly, “Thank you :)”. It was never mentioned again…. LOL.

We’ve only seen them a few times since the birth, which haven’t been very pleasant. I’m the one who posted earlier about her wanting screaming baby pictures and is now (very) upset that she’s not babysitting once a week at our inconvenience. But I’ve been kind of brooding about the fact that she was so pushy about the infant care book, to get “up to date” and “be on the same page” as us, AND want to babysit…just to have her, during one of our postpartum visits, say this about SIDS safety guidelines:

“There’s just so much information to overwhelm new parents”

Actually, they are very fucking simple. And helpful. And lifesaving. And backed by research. But IDK, what do I know, being a first time mom.

The conversation pretty much went on for a few more minutes about how strange it is that safety recommendations change, kids were fine in her day, blah, blah, blah.  But she seemed almost as if she read the book and didn’t care too much about the information inside, and wanted to complain how unreasonable it is for her to have to follow it.  

DH and I have finally noticed what the hell might be her problem - she just wants to make drama.  I'm not even certain she wanted to babysit in the first place, just wanted to argue with us, make us feel like the bad guys.  Her last communication to us was her trying to change the whole daycare thing around to the fact that kiddo can't handle car rides (she can handle them, I'm really not sure where she got that idea other than us mentioning how inconvenient driving in traffic to their place would be once a week...).

Also, as a small update, kiddo is doing great in daycare and comes home happy and I feel like my life is coming together a lot more! I’ll also mention (just in case it comes up), that NO MIL, is NOT allow to babysit or have unsupervised visitation. We have one more visit with them before the holidays start, and their behavior then is going to determine our level of involvement in the holidays, and since she’s incapable of chilling out, I have a feeling we are going to have a small family Christmas without the extended family around."
875,"I flaired this success cuz it does contain a small bit of success... Anyway. Check bitchbot for my first post pls as i am on mobile and not sure how to link it.

Well today we were supposed to meet with the public defender on my fiances case. It was super important to us as we recently discovered we will not be eligible for any programs to help get us into our own place as long as that stupid assault charge is on his record. So we dressed up (even had a pretty swanky hotel room for the night to prepare thanks to sometimes yfil). We head up to the courthouse only to find out they dug up some crap from a year ago where my fiance said some stuff in anger about his mother. So they added on a charge of menacing. I think they did this on purpose cuz they knew we intended to fight this crap. The lawyer tells my fiance that we have to come back in a month again since they rolled both charges into one case. And he also said its not in his best interest to fight this. Uh scuse me bitch? Like no. What is NOT in his best interest is eating an assault charge that he doesn't deserve for defending himself against being attacked and HAVING HIS FINGERNAIL RIPPED OFF that is not only preventing us from getting helped but also from getting a place on our own and could get in the way of getting employed. Unbelievable. So that part was bogus.

The reason i chose to flair success tho....and to end on a slightly happier note... Sometimes yfil actually took the day off work to give us a ride to court and was there to testify to his wife being the aggressor AND he is willing to testify to the years of abuse at her hand. So. He may not have been willing to stop it but at least he is trying to do right now. And my fiance is getting a shiny spine where his father is concerned. He used to just kinda have these rose colored glasses when it came to his father. But he finally has started to speak up for himself to fil. He even told him he doesn't want to hear about the drama and bullshit that goes on in their home due to his fil choices to keep her around. He was basically like i have no sympathy for you and i couldnt care less about her. This mf (fil) had the nerve to send fiance a meme that said ""no matter what level of crazy she has you still love your mother"" . y'all. We flipped when that happened. But thankfully after being told to quit the flying monkey bs he has stopped. So at least a relationship with his son matters enough for that. 

Sorry there isnt much meat to this update. I really didnt expect us to be rescheduled again but i wanted to post something cuz of the great support and advice my first post got and in case anyone was wondering what was up with finger biter. Thanks for letting me rant. I really hope things go our way next time."
876,"I have posted here about my yesnoMIL, but my super-hell-no-mother asked about me for the first time in 5 months, and it was still about her. “Does your sister miss me?” she asked my sister. 

I asked myself, do I miss her? I see her in the mirror sometimes, just a bit. I can think of maybe one positive interaction we’ve had in the last 5 years. I’m sure there’s another one or two but it doesn’t come to mind. I think of how free I feel not having to constantly worry about her, how I had to downplay my relationships with others so she wouldn’t get jealous and fight with people I care about (she did anyway, and screamed at them not to talk to me), the constant preparation of “so, my mom is coming... it’s okay if you don’t want to come, if she tries to kiss you on the mouth just turn your head, she will say something weird...”, the constant apologies “I’m so sorry about my mom the other day...””I’m so sorry she blew up your phone, best to just block her because it won’t stop.” And that’s nothing compared to the abuse I endured when she was bigger than me, or when she’s actively psychotic. 

It’s been 6 months or so and I don’t freak out when my phone rings anymore. I don’t ughh when my text tone goes off. I don’t have panic attacks. I don’t cry for way too long over all the worst moments in my life that she loves to berate me with. 

And my son is safe. He gets to live in a world where she doesn’t even exist. 

Lately things have been getting better with MIL, my heart is still broken from what she said, but I can sit with the emotion and not let it overpower me. And I haven’t had to hear from my own mother, except her many persistent FMs. I have a newborn and my life is the calmest it’s ever been lol. What a world. 

Nah. I don’t miss her. Part of me feels like I should, and I thought I would by now to be honest, but I just don’t. I don’t know if I’ll ever talk to her again, but I don’t feel like it right now, and that’s how I’ve taken it, day by day."
877,"Good day, friends! An older, already-handled story for today, but I do love advice so feel free to share.

So Jan Snow always had an issue about DH and I living together before we were officially married. She always claimed it went against her (and therefore DH's and my) morals as a good Christian. Interestingly, our pastor somewhat disagreed. He suggested that it would make it difficult to maintain the self-control needed to be chaste (lol, like we were doing that anyway), but there was nothing Biblical that specifically prohibited cohabitation.

DH and I signed independent leases on housing right before we started dating. I lived with one of my female friends and he moved in with four of our other friends (one of whom was female and we never heard the end of it from Jan Snow). Once we got together, though, we pretty much lived together. We alternated which house we stayed at, but there maybe two nights that year that we didn't spend together. So we had arguably been living together for a year before we were engaged.

This past summer, we had originally planned to pick up internships in DH's home city and spend the summer on the east coast. This included the time right before our wedding. Now, a church friend heard about our search for housing (I was fighting staying with the ILs because I just knew three months in their house would be disastrous for my new marriage) and offered, as a wedding gift, to allow DH and I to live in her basement apartment rent free for the time we would be in town. We sat down to hash out the details and I mentioned the date that WE would be moving in. Church friend seemed mildly uncomfortable, but didn't say anything about it. However, after that meeting while chatting with Jan Snow &amp; co., shit hit the fan.

Some quotes:

""That's not what God would want you to do.""

""We've raised you better than this.""

""You know it's wrong!"" (This one is directly related to Jan Snow's nickname, as mentioned previously in another post)

""You could do us just this one favor!""

And my personal (least?) favorite:
""It's only for two weeks!""

That last one pisses me off still. Yes, bitch, it was only for two weeks. But it was two weeks before our damn wedding when I was a stressed, anxious ball of mess and had never spent more than two nights away from my man. So climb down from your moral high horse for two weeks and deal with it.

Lucky me, DH has a spine of steel and that day it shone. They pulled him aside to attack him and try the triangulation tactic and it didn't work! DH held firm that we had made a decision and would stand by it. MIL cried and FIL made sure to express their disappointment many times over. We did end up deciding to stay in separate rooms at the ILs house for that two weeks before our wedding before moving in together, though.

Now, we ended up not living there due to the church friend retracting her offer (another story for a different sub), so the ending is actually pretty great. Instead of us staying with the ILs and moving in together after the wedding, we decided to stay in our college town for the summer (in a gorgeous rental under BOTH of our names) and just move in together. So their plans backfired spectacularly.

I made sure to post all over social media about our house and how happy I was to be living together, and made sure to send them photos of us repainting our new bedroom the week before our wedding. You may or may not be able to see the condoms on the nightstand if you look close enough.

Jan Snow enjoys bitch games, but she plays against a pro, and she always earns herself a prize.

Funny thing, though. We did end up staying with them for a future visit. They had redone DH's childhood bedroom to be a guestroom with a queen size bed ""for now that you guys are married"" *eye roll*. FIL went on at great length about how carefully he built the bedframe with rubber liners so it wouldn't squeak, as he remembered the early days of marriage. I dragged my newly-minted DH upstairs quite often for fun times (I'm a weird-flex-but-okay kinda gal). And FIL was right! The bed didn't squeak at all!

Too bad the floor did. Also too bad they were watching a movie directly downstairs."
878,"UPDATE: MIL came over for dinner, ate what I made but still said she wished we could have had pizza, but I guess this is healthier. I made a killer meal with spaghetti squash, sauteed chicken, broccoli and a lemon garlic butter cream sauce! She then got on to talking about last Monday, and I called her out for WALKING IN THE FRONT DOOR! and she dead ass looked me right in the eye and said ""I didn't just walk in, and if I did I apologize."" I had to walk away, I went upstairs and took a hot shower and just cried because I was so furious! 



A quick recap of how I feel about JNMIL.....I HATE being around her, she gives me anxiety and my DH knows this. She has medical issues that causes her to be on O2 24/7. 

Me and DH had a son 3 months ago, and she gets to come see him once a week (which is more then I would prefer but hey, gotta pick you battles, right?!) 

Anyway, last week I was finally getting around to decorating for fall/Halloween. I was downstairs on the basement putting a box of stuff back down there and when I come back up, my MIL is walking in the front door! My heart just about stopped and I had to walk into the kitchen so I didn't lose my shit right then and there. Now, my front door isn't usually left open, but since I was putting decorations on the porch, the door was open.  Of course hubs was sleeping (he worked overnight) so I had no buffer. She immediately sit down I  from of son's sign, which he was sleeping in, and tried to wake him up. Barely said two words to me. She then goes on to ask me about babysitting. That is a hard NO! She says ""well maybe just on the days that DH has to work overnight then babysit when he gets home, I can come over and watch DS. DH will be upstairs if I need help!"" 1. IT'S NOT BABYSITTING IF IT'S HIS OWN KID! that drives me nuts, but whatever. 2. HELL NO! I don't trust her at all! She can't even walk up the 10 stairs to our house without getting so out breath she has to sit on the landing of the staircase before she can sit on the couch. 

I told her I would have to talk to DH about it, I'm not giving an answer without talking to him. We're a team, a partnership and we make decisions together. (This was literally just so I didn't have to deal wit the backlash of telling her no on the spot, let hubs deal with it....it's his mom) she then got all snippy with me, accusing me of keeping her grandson away from her and goes to storm out of the house. Says I came over to ask you and DH in person but I guess you'll just make up some lie because he's sleeping"" I calmly said to her, you make up these stories in your head and immediately think the worst in people. I didn't say yes, I didn't say no, I said I have to talk to hubs. We are married for a reason and make decisions about our family together. Now please leave so I can finish decorating. 

Fast forward to last night, she is coming over to visit this evening and told DH she wants to order pizza for dinner. everything is always about food when she comes over, I think it's her way of trying to stay longer. Anyway, he told her that her that we're trying to eat better, so I was going to make dinner (I told him I was! He didn't volunteer me) she got all pissy about how she just wanted pizza and why can't we get it just this once when she's here. We can't because we don't want to, and we just had pizza on Sunday during the football game! Also, none of your business! You're coming to our home, to see our son. You'll eat what I make you or don't eat at all."
879,"Hi all, LTL, FTP. This might be a long one cuz I have a lot to get off my chest. I apologise in advance if the formatting is wonky.

So I've been with my DH for about 12 years now, coming 3 years married. My relationship with my mil has been going downhill ever since we got married and moved out.

To set the stage, we're Southeast Asian and are Catholics (will be important later). Here're some of the things (probably not in chronological order, but I'll do my best) I can remember her doing that truly irked me and sometimes made me feel disgusted to my bones:

**Pre-wedding**

* Had lunch at the airport and my then-fiance said that the place we were going to operated like another restaurant, where you were issued cards and those were scanned at the stalls you ordered food from, then you paid at the end of the meal based on the credits racked up on said cards. She screamed that he never brought her to this restaurant (we didn't cuz she doesn't like Western food), stomped her feet and said that she ***knew*** he would not take care of her once he had a girlfriend. I had no where to put my face, guys. I was so freaking embarrassed. (Apparently DH made a promise to her when he was like 5 that he would always take care of her even when he had a girlfriend/wife. And she's been holding it to him ever since. **HE WAS 5**.)
* Went on 3-week trip to Melbourne. All she wanted to do was eat Chinese/Asian food, then complain that it wasn't nice and expensive. Once, she even threw a silent tantrum because we wanted to eat at a roadhouse and she didn't. She ended up drinking water the entire meal and sulking. Thereafter she rushed to buy sushi (and of course complained it wasn't nice).
* In the same trip, she kept insisting that I wanted to do/see things (which I didn't want to do but SHE did). She also threw another tantrum when I mentioned that I **NEVER** said I wanted to go out shopping with her in the streets of Ballarat in 40-degree weather (also the shops were mostly closed). She pretty much screamed that the whole world was against her and that we always made her out to be in the wrong.

**Wedding planning, the day of, and shortly after**

* Initially she said she wouldn't interfere and let us do whatever we wanted. I wanted a small, cosy wedding with only people I actually knew. Chinese weddings are usually large affairs with both sets of parents inviting pretty much everyone under the sun. My idea was a church ceremony followed by a Western sit-down dinner. Cue MIL insisting on a full 8-course Chinese dinner at a hotel and it absolutely blew our budget.
* Chinese weddings also usually have traditions that somewhat blur the line between customs and religion. Here's where the Catholic part comes in: she insisted we do things like having someone comb my hair by the window in moonlight while reciting some blessings and to receive blessings from a moon goddess? She even printed out a whole stack of documents on the wedding traditions she said I HAD to follow. But thankfully DH had a shiny spine and we sat down together, highlighted every single line that had any mention of receiving blessings from a deity and said that we're Catholic, we only need God's blessings. Cue butthurt and her saying we should take all the blessings we can get, regardless of source. (Ironically, she was also the one who insisted I converted to Catholicism so that we could have a full Catholic wedding mass, Communion and all).
* For the wedding mass, she initially bought a fucking white dress. A WHITE DRESS. I sent her daughter to her as my mouthpiece saying that white was for the bride. So she changed to a red dress. That obviously clashed with my tea ceremony gown (tea ceremonies are where we offer our respect to our elders by offering them a cup of tea the day of the wedding and younger family members offer the bridal couple tea as well.)
* She insisted on having a tea ceremony at her place where there was no one for us to offer tea to expect my in-laws. The rest of her family would be doing the ceremony at the hotel just before the dinner. We acceeded. We rushed. We reached her place, only to find out she was still getting her hair and makeup done. There was no area designated for the ceremony. And because the ceremony there was so short, we wasted a lot of time doing nothing. Time which I had paid the photographer for. We could have done an outdoor shoot with my bridal party!
* She also pissed off the photographer many, many times by calling him a ""camera man"" despite him correcting her countless of times.
* At the wedding dinner, she also flashed my MOH's husband many times as she was wearing a high-split skirt and she has absolutely zero decorum.
* During my speech, I told my parents that they had not lost a daughter, but gained a son instead. (For Chinese families, many consider the girls to be married out into the husband's family and is not theirs anymore.) She then told my parents, ""You're so lucky! You gained a son!! I only gained a daughter and I already have two!"" Much wow.
* At the end of the dinner, it is usual for the bride, groom and their parents to stand at the door to thank the guests for coming. For some godforsaken reason, she decided to plant herself between me and my parents.
* We had booked a trip to Bangkok as a minimoon shortly after the wedding. Of course she had to follow. She insisted it was her own separate trip. She then insisted we meet for meals. I just wanted to be in a country she wasn't in. I guess that ought to have been a red flag of how much she wanted to be part of our marriage. So that's another trip I'll never get back.

**Married and living in her house**

* I was pretty much living in a jail with no room of my own to go to.We were still living in her house as we were waiting for our own to be ready. It was really tough living under someone else's roof. I remember our first Valentine's day as a married couple. We'd decided to just order in cuz we knew restaurants would be fully booked. She insisted on us waiting for her to get back before we ordered the food. So we did. She finally returned, ordered her food and proceeded to wolf down a couple of slices of bread and declared she was full and didn't want to eat dinner anymore.
* She would keep trying to brainwash me not to move out of her house as ""she would be very lonely"". Who asked her to keep having cold wars with her husband?
* And when I'm around, she'd hold conversations in Cantonese cuz she thinks I don't understand. And I know she's talking about me. I understand enough to know.

**Pregnancy, birth and confinement**

* As we'd been together for so long prior to marriage, we decided to dive straight into babymaking. We finally got our positive HPT after 9 months of trying.
* When we announced our pregnancy, the first thing she said was ""You should thank me! I've been praying to Mother Mary to give you gift of motherhood!""
* She kept trying to touch my bump despite me being uncomfortable with people touching me. And she'd keep her hand on me for sooooo long, trying to feel my son move. (baby hated people touching too, so he cooperated and didn't move as long as her hands were on me, and would start kicking again once she was gone lol)
* She kept insisting that we visit a fengshui master to calculate my son's name. We rejected her saying we were Catholic. She implied we were bad parents because we weren't doing our part to give him the best headstart in life.
* She insisted on coming to visit the day of the birth of my son despite us saying no. And she came all the 3 days I was there.
* She also plastered pictures of my son all over facebook immediately after his birth, when I had yet to announce his birth. I then received texts from friends asking why I hadn't told them I'd given birth. (She also has this strange habit of leaving comments on my social media posts like asking why we didn't invite her, even once telling my DH that his uncle had died in a completely unrelated post.)
* During my confinement where was I battling slight PPD, she decided to text me asking who came up with his name and that it sounded like 'depression' in Chinese.
* She has asked my husband multiple times if she could be his primary caregiver by way of him living with her on weekdays and we'd take him home on weekends. Obviously we've rejected because we very much want our son and we want to be with him as long as can.
* She has also said to my son, ""Oh you poor thing, your mother doesn't want you anymore cuz she's sending you to infant care so early. You should come and live with grandma instead"". Because of this I am very hesitant to her having unsupervised access to him cuz I don't know what shit she'll say to him. She also speaks to him in Cantonese cuz she thinks I don't understand it.

**Now**

* As a result of all of that, I've decided to minimise contact with her as much as possible. She's now butthurt that she doesn't get to see her grandchild as often as my parents do (they help to pick up my son on the days I'm going to be working late because they live so close. And obviously I trust my parents a lot more than her).
* She has tried multiple times to get access to his infant care so that she can ""play with him when she is bored"". Obviously we're not putting her on the list of caregivers that can check him in and out of school. DH deflected and said that the school has a restricted number of caregivers on the access list. She insists that she should be on the list, and that the school shouldn't make life difficult for parents and let maternal and paternal grandparents have access.
* On the days that she does come over to supposedly visit her grandchild, all she does is charge her phone and play games on it. I'm not sure who or what she's bonding with.
* Her favourite daughter is now her flying monkey and is constantly sending DH barrages of texts on how we're hurting her feeeeeeeeeelings and we're not including her in our lives because we're faaaaaamily. She used be his favourite sister so it's sad how that relationship's being affected as well. DH is getting more and more frustrated with this situation and we're trying to figure out how to get her off our backs.

Do we just bite the bullet and schedule weekly/bi-weekly visits? But she gives me so much anxiety and I end up in a very bad mood in the days leading up to her visit and I feel like I am not myself every time she is around. Or am I the JN instead and I should just suck it up and accept that she's never going to leave? I'm so tired and drained and I literally feel dread in my soul every time she texts me asking if she can come by that weekend.

It helps that DH doesn't like his mother too and is very on my side regarding contact with her, but his FM of a sister is really getting on his nerves and there's apparently a lot of text drama that goes on that he doesn't tell me about.

I know I am very obviously playing favourites with my son's grandparents but I really can't help it when she's done all that shit.

Thanks for reading this far y'all. It feels good to get this out there."
880,"I need to preface this story with the fact that I had heard things about his mother from his friends before we started dating. However, I didn’t let that stop me. 
My boyfriend and I started dating in January of 2019. We were both 17 and seniors in high school. When we first started talking, he said he wanted to go to a school that was 1200 miles away from home. You’d think that would be an instant turn off, but it wasn’t, because coincidentally, by some act of god, I was going to a school down the street from that one. We both applied to our respective universities and both got accepted. We started to plan moving, housing, ect. Until one wary day when a I got a text from my boyfriend telling me that his mother said that he was not going to be going to this school that he wanted. She had decided that he was going to be going to Community College 25 minutes from home. There was no leeway, and since he was only 17 at this point and his parents had access to his savings, he had to go to the school they decided.
As much as it broke my heart to leave, I did not let this stop me. I moved to my dream school, 1200 miles away. We decided that we weren’t going to break up as we were very happy together and we thought we could make it through. For his 18th birthday, my (travel agent) grandmother bought him a plane ticket to come see me. I thought this experience would be amazing because it was the first time we’d ever be alone together for 4 whole days and we had never had a chance like that before.
Fast forward a bit, and two weeks before the trip, MIL decides she is going to go with him. She does her usual screaming at him to pack his bags, all of this bs. They finally come down to where I live now. She sets some very strict rules on sleeping arrangements. No one is surprised by this. But I promise, it gets worse. 
The first full day of them visiting, bf and i take a nap since we were up late watching a movie the night before. We wake up to a text, in a group chat, with his mother saying “You guys are lame. I’m going to the pool.” 
She comes back upstairs at some point, huffing and puffing and angry that she was alone. Keep in mind, this was her choice to accompany him.  
She keeps this passive aggressiveness up for the next 2 days. Finally, Saturday night, she makes a decent decision. I live in Orlando. MIL decides we’re going to Epcot the next day. MIL is an irish catholic alcoholic. Epcot is doing the International Food and Wine festival right now. Regardless of the alcoholism, I think to myself, this is a good thing. She can’t be angry and passive aggressive while we’re at disney. Boy was I wrong. 
The day started off great. However, the more MIL drank, the angrier she got. She was pissed that some ride she used to love got taken down for Frozen Ever After. She took this as a personal attack and hugged and puffed for the rest of the day. She did the same thing when the Land, the literal lamest ride on earth, closed before we could get to it. Literally was mad all. damn. day. At one point, we said that we were hungry and we were going to go get some food, and she told us to go without her, and then while we were eating, she texted us asking if we had “ditched” her. 
Finally, the last day of the trip rolls around. I’m super sad because I don’t want BF to leave, since i won’t see him for another month or so. We have until 2 o’clock to check out of the hotel for their 7 o’clock flight. BF and I pack all of our stuff and go down to the pool around 11. It hits about 12:30 and I tell bf that we should probably go upstairs in 15 so we can make sure everything is ready before we have to check out for them to leave. No more than 5 minutes go by before I hear stomping and then an angry and condescending, “TIME TO GO.” and then more stomping. I turn around and MIL is in a nightgown, walking back up to our room without us. We get upstairs and she is scolding both of us for being in the pool for so long. Once again, as if anyone asked her to come. 

Fast forward 3 weeks, to tonight. Haven’t seen bf since that day, still talk to him and facetime him every day. Tonight, we’re doing our usual nightly routine which includes an hour of R6 Siege. Through his headset, I hear MIL open the door. Now this is an important detail: it is 10:45pm on a tuesday night. Any 18 year old in the world is awake, and the ones at my school are probably all getting drunk and high. 

MIL sees BF playing Siege with me, and says, very loudly,
“SERIOUSLY?!”
bf: “What?”
MIL: “Don’t you have class at 8:30 tomorrow?!”
bf “...Yeah?” 
MIL: “It’s time for you to go to bed.” 
She then walks out and slams the door. I feel anger and second hand embarrassment for bf, but I know she’s always like this. 
Now, the worst part of this whole story. She texts him 5 mins later. 
“I will have no issue removing your bedroom door if this continues to be a problem.” 

TL;DR: My boyfriends mom is nuts and thinks her 18 year old son is 10."
881,"Obligatory LTL, FTP, on mobile.

This is about 5 years old, so no advice needed, but happy to take snappy come back advice :)

We ended up announcing my pregnancy very, very early. We'd had losses, so this scared the ever living crap out of me, but my defacto mother (not my actual egg donor's) health had taken a turn and I desperately wanted her to know. After we had shared the news with them, my slightly FOGgy, mostly DearH felt guilty about having shared with my family and not his, so we call and share the exciting news, with me feeling sad because his mother is a huge gossip and I knew, deep down, that that would be the only other announcement we'd get to make to people who didn't already know. His dad, who's lovely, makes all the right noises, and then my MIL pipes in. 

""Well, that's huge news. You know, just like someone dying."" 

Luckily, both DH and FIL both piped up with ""except not at all"" before I'd even picked my jaw up off the ground, and my husband ushered me off the call to go find some lunch. It still makes me want to face palm every time I think about it."
882,"This isn’t really a rant. More of a BEC. I hate “K” in text messages. Pet peeve of mine. My in-laws use it often, was actually the first minor disagreement with my DH while dating. Put an O in front of it. It enrages me, unreasonably. It’s unreasonable of me but again. Pet peeve. 

My in-laws are aware of this pet peeve. They used to do it all the time but I shared a book of faces comedy video about hating it. Then had an in depth discussion at Easter (as a result of the video, all talk good natured) of how it just rubs me the wrong way and how previously, I have instantly responded to my DH and my BFF that “I hate that.” No one messages me “K” anymore lol 

My DH has been in a weird place with his parents. My MIL in particular is taking offense at his stand offish behavior (normal for him and their relationship). We had a group text message for an event. It was at least 25-30 messages long. She responded to every other message with “OK” if warranted. All whopping two of my messages were responded to with “K”. She’s punishing me for his behavior with “K”. 

I don’t even think she dislikes me. She just wants me to reign my DH in which is not my job (or even in my capabilities, that would take years of therapy) as he has a lifetime of issues with her. She’s super passive aggressive on a good day. I noticed the use of “K” only in response to me in the text. I did not engage (because really, my pet peeve is stupid). But I think I’m gonna share that comedy video of people responding “K” again... 

DH told me I’m overthinking which is fair. But when every other message on the 25-30 message thread was responded to with “OK” and I’m not making DH do what she wants, I get a “K” after lots of talk of how I hate that in his family. I wonder.

I’m not even mad. That level of trolling is actually admirable."
883,"Thankfully, my MIL isn't very involved in our lives (her choice), so hopefully I won't get to post here very often, but I've only been married a year so we'll see.
The one thing that she's done that has really gotten under my skin happened a few months ago, so I don't know if I need any specific advice, mostly just venting because it still pisses me off.

It was when my son was born (my first child, DH's second) I was in labor for two days and in the hospital for three more because of complications. Everyone in my family visited us at the hospital at least once and then helped us get settled when we went home.

A week after my son was born, my MIL (who lives in town) finally came to visit for about half an hour. At this point, she decided to tell me specifically that she hadn't come to see us at the hospital because my son ""wasn't her first grandchild so it wasn't that important.""

For the record, my son is her third grandchild, and the only one who lives in the same town that she does, and that's the only time she has visited him. I can't say that I consider that a bad thing."
884,"This is my second post here I think, and this conversation was a few weeks ago but it still annoys me a little. 

My(22F) mother(48F) inherited her choleric temper presumably from her dad(82m), who is also very quick to yell at you over things you did not know would anger him. (For example, this weekend I was at thier place and borrowed his key, both of us were on the go and he told me first to be back by 4pm so I can let him in, then recanted that since he remembered grandma would be back by 3. I then got home by 3, had to leave again to get something for her but she was at home to open the door for him. When I got back he yelled at me for 3 minutes because I was not there to open the door and it took a while for her to get up. ) 

A little backstory: 

On Easter my mother got mad at me about moving a table. I posted about this on AITA i think, but to make it quick: My dad needed another table at the grill, my cousin helped me get a table from the porch over to him after I took the things that were on it ( a lamp, a figurine, a gardenhose end and a few misc garden things) and placed them on the bench next to it. When I went back to bring the things that needed it inside, my mother noticed the missing table, came over and yelled at my for throwing her things on the ground so carelessly. She punctuated her words by taking things from the bench - including a former, now not anymore, working lamp- and throwing them onto the stone ground we were standing on. Then she stomped away like a toddler not getting his icecream. (the next day grandpa also yelled at me for doing something both him and her do on the reg, so I said fuck it, made my dad drive me to the trainstation and left the family easter get together a day early, much to my moms rage) 

&amp;#x200B;

To the now:   
A few weeks ago I thought hey, we are both calm and in an okay mood, lets talk? and we got to the topic of easter. I said, I think you handled this very badly, and it hurt me a lot to be yelled at by you and you throwing things on the floor is not a great way to handle people doing something they did not know you wouldn't like.   
And all she said was, she doesnt remember that. She remembers Easter, and she remembers me being a little snotty bitch and leaving early because I can't handle adults telling me what to do (thats refering to grandpa yelling at me). She does not remember throwing things. And even if she did, I should have behaved like and adult and stayed and let my grandpa continue yell at me because he is my elder and you show your elders respect.  

All I said was i don't see why I should respect people that dont respect me and was once again called a brat, thought okay whatever and left the room. She called after me if I was now ""offended and having a tantrum again""

&amp;#x200B;

So. here I am now. I am very happy I now live in a student dorm and not with my parents anymore because at least the yelling is getting less frequent. It still frustrates me to no end that both her and her father will behave like little children and then turn around to tell me to act more like an adult and stop running (a.k.a. leaving the room)away from them"
885,"\*Disclaimer- TP Patrol has been cut off for almost 4 years now. 1000% no contact. She is still actively stalking and harassing, but she is greeted with silence.

I had decided to go VVVVLC with TPP after a long, dramatic text from her in Nov of 2015. (I believe you can find that in my history). This recalls the second to the last time i ever spoke to TPP. There's not really much point to this, beyond to recall how TPP treated and spoke to me as a ""lesser than"" and how she'd try to rewrite history even with black and white proof in front of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around Christmas, I got the feels and was tired of everybody badgering me, so I texted her and broke my VVVVVLC (I will include the text conversations). I did it, because in the back of my mind, I knew she'd go hysterical and pitch a fit if I didn't tell her before I announced publicly, and well, I was right, but she apparently did it anyway. My brother snuck her christmas present into DD and made a point of continuously putting it into her hands when I wasn't looking. Then Tpp/grandma ambushed me outside of my house Dec 26. We bought a new car Dec 31, and her best friend works at the dealership. Here's the texts. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Dec 23rd ish: Me: *Thank you for DD's gift. She enjoyed it. Just so you know, so you don't here it from somewhere else as we will be announcing soon (but not yet, so please don't tell anybody) we are expecting #2 this summer. Merry Christmas.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Dec30: Mom: *I already knew from my instincts you was pregnant, no one had to tell me. You know I've always been pretty dang good at knowing things without being told. I am happy for you. I know how it feels wanting something so bad and not being able to have it when you want it. Give DD loves from Grammy.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Jan 1: Me: *I'm sure TPP's Best Friend already told you, but we bought a new car. I was surprised to hear her congratulate me on my pregnancy while I was there.*

&amp;#x200B;

 

TPP: *everybody needs someone to talk to. She's my go to. She love ya'll and DD and was happy for you, just like I am.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *I told you we had not announced yet. I found out you told Grandma when ya'll showed up here, now TPP's Best Friend, who else have you told? I do not appreciate that at all.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *You ever think I was excited I am going to have another grand baby. Even tho you won't let me see the one I already have. Excited for you that you are having another after wanting another so bad? you just want to find something to gripe at me and hurt me for. It doesn't matter what i say or do I never do right by you. I love you. I love DD happy new year. I wish you'd started  it out better.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Jan 2: TPP sends screen shot of my Dec 31 9 pm facebook post, announcing my pregnancy in the fireworks. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *You sent me you was preg jan 1st. It was going to get out then got mad at me for telling Grandma and TPP's Best Friend but yet a friend sent me this because I had not announced it. Look at the date You really know how to hurt your mom don't you? that was pretty sorry of u to do that. You really hurt me, Glad your happy you did that. Now you can be happy.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Sent screen shot of the message on Dec 23rd ish, where I had announced to her I was pregnant AND told her to keep her mouth shut. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *The date on that says December 23. I announced because it's MY pregnancy and I can. Six days after you'd told Grandma and whoever else. You'd already told whoever the heck you wanted to anyway. I'm not sure what the point of you messaging me today was besides to tell me i'm ""sorry"" for announcing my own pregnancy.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *that's a lie. I had not told them until the we day we after. But you put didn't want your own mom to know but announced it to FB? That is SICKENING*

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *I MESSAGED YOU AND TOLD YOU. I have the screenshot above that I TOLD YOU ON CHRISTMAS. Please reread and check dates before you go accusing me of things. SIX DAYS before I announced my OWN PREGNANCY. MY PREGNANCY. My body. Not yours. But I told you and also told you we had not announced yet (see the screen shot!) Yet Grandma knew Dec 26 and TPP's Best Friend knew Dec 30? Days before I announced? that's sickening, that you couldn't keep it to yourself even after I told you I hadn't announced. I'm done with this conversation.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

TPP: *you are right. You wanted to post that a few days after you told me. I'm sorry. But as far as me telling anyone but Grandma before the Post I DID NOT. Not even TPP's Best Friend. I told Grandma before coming by there trying to cheer her up because she had been crying for a week. We just left the cemetery putting flowers on graves and she wanted to see yall. Anyway good luck with your preg. I hope it goes well. No two ever goes the same so it should go smother. I love ya'll.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *TPP's Best Friend knew because I saw her the day I got my new car, hours before I posted that, and she told me congrats. So PLEASE just stop. I know you did. And then calling me sickening for announcing my own pregnancy. You've told me so many times Grandma can't keep a secret, so you telling her really made me mad.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Tpp: *I did not tell her till the 30th.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *A full day before I told anybody else. Doesn't matter. I told you we hadn't announced. I now know now it is. I'm going to bed.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

Tpp: *Cousin* (that Tpp and grandma have shunned from the family, and none of the rest of them will talk to) *told a family member right after you found out. Your dad and Aunt knew but you didn't want your mom and your only grandmother to know. Its ok op, I know how it is too. You find some reason to keep DD from me and any reason you can to hate me. And no, I didn't tell TPP's Best Friend before you post it.* 

(Keep in mind TPP stalks ""public"" book of faces posts by me, and then says a ""friend"" sent them to her. She'd seen my cousin comment ""Finally! I was the first to know!"" So this is where that came from.) 

 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *Keep lying Tpp. You just said you told TPP's Best Friend Dec 30. Ha I saw her the 31st. About 5 hours before I posted anything. and No, Cousin didn't tell anybody because guess what? Cousin didn't know till about an hour before I posted. I'm not sure why you feel the continued need to lie, but that's okay. Whatever. Goodbye.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Tpp:  *Cousin knew before anybody else. I've got no reason to lie. I have nothing else to lose. I do not have you nor dd in my life so what else can i lose. You not letting me be a part of ya'lls lives so I won't be part of the new baby either. So I've got nothing to lie about and nothing to lose. I am done. You know all about lies, don't cha. You tell them all the time. And apparently I'm not your mom because you haven't let me feel like i'm your mom in a long long long time. You made AUnt your mom because she will tolerate your bullshit and I won't. now you see how it feels. Not good does it. I will keep getting into your business because it's MY BUSINESS TOO!* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jan 18th: 

Tpp: *just wanted you to know no matter how mad we get with each other I still love you. Tell DD grammy loves her*

*Can I see a sonogram of MY grandbaby?* 

 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's the end. I didn't ever respond. I felt so removed from the situation I wasn't sure where to turn or what to do. Could she really think she had so much power over me she could make me believe something happened that didn't? Or that it's my fault she's upset for announcing my own pregnancy? Or she can rewrite history despite written proof?"
886,"TDLR: JNFMIL tries to give me her sales rep catalogue for a beauty brand, despite being told no in the past. I return it unopened and BF backs me up. MINOR SUCCESS 

 So my BFs mum (JNFMIL) has some justno behaviours for sure but he has a super shiney spine. 

Her behaviours, for example: 
She brought up his ex-fiancee within 5 minutes of meeting me;
She brings up the ex several times if she can in a conversation; 
When i mentioned i was going on holiday with my JYMum, sister and aunt and my BF said he wanted to go with me in the future she glared at me and said ""no (BF aka her son) if taking me there! You two cannot go before we go""   the destination could be quite romantic as a pair. My BF just rolled his eyes and shut her down. 
If she wants to go out for the day she will ring her sons and ditch her husband aka my FFIL. 
She will walk into my house, march straight in (shoes on despite us being screamed at as soon as my foots on her welcome mat). She will then sit where I clearly was working from home and demand a cup of tea! She was rarely invited or if she was would turn up an hour before my lunch break. I did shut this down very quickly. 

Anyway this is a story of a tiny bit of success. So earlier in the summer JNFMIL was behaving and keeping her distance. We were almost getting along which was good for BF as it meant less stress for him. Now JNFMIL is a sales rep for a beauty brand and sends out catalogues every month, collects the orders and then delievers them. I refuse to buy anything from her as I do not want a financial relationship with this woman. I have claimed that I break out with the make up so it has provided a pass too and easier to push this brand away. 

So my FFIL comes round to help put a TV on the wall and she has shoved a catalogue in with his tools to give me to me. I was not happy as this felt like she was just using our recently better relationship to get money. As he left I then passed FFIL the catalogue and said to him that I don't  want anything from the brand, as we have said before. It was clearly unopened. 

30 minutes later BF gets a text from his mum ""it is so rude she didnt even open it. We do more than make up you know!"" My BF replied ""We have told you multiple times no so stop pushing the issue. The answer will always be no"" 

She never replied.

I know its only a minor success but I didn't give in!"
887,"**TW for animal abuse and neglect**

An earlier post in r/JUSTNOMIL and a post in r/AITA made me think of this. This is on-going and makes me want to slap my MIL Wreck-It Rose for her stupidity.

My family is very much ""dog people."" We all have dogs (except for me because of my lease). We like to tell each other about different dogs we see, our favorite car game is pointing out the dogs in the cars around us, we LOVE dogs. What's more important is, we all know how to feed and train our dogs. We don't buy cheap dog food for our dogs and get them ""the good stuff."" My dad's dog is allergic to most grains and will have seizures if she has too much, so they get her the high-end grain-free stuff. Even treats can't have any grains in them. She's eight years old and she's sharp as a tack.

With how my family is with dogs, it came as a culture shock when DH entered my picture. He thought dogs were cute, but to him, they were all very dumb animals not worth your time. He's still getting used to petting them and is not a fan of them licking him. So when I went to his parents' house and saw all the dog figurines and magnets and how his grandparents acted toward their dogs (incredibly loving and acted more like my family) I was really surprised. His sister told me upon meeting her that their dog had just passed a few months earlier. She and WIR and FIL all seemed upset about it. SIL spent the whole evening (Thanksgiving) and the next day gibbering excitedly about the new puppy they were going to be getting.

It's Saturday after Thanksgiving, and they get a little chocolate lab puppy. Eight weeks old and super floppy and excitable. She wanted to be with EVERYONE. NOW. LOVE ME. I thought she was the sweetest and most darling little thing I'd ever met (so pretty much my standard reaction to meeting a new puppy). Everyone was all over her. FIL said where he wanted to put her dishes and her bed. All was well.

And then she had an accident in the kitchen. She's nine weeks old at this point, it's going to happen. But to WIR, nothing--NOTHING--more atrocious had ever happened in her house! She grabbed the puppy by the neck and shoved her face into the puddle until she was yelping, and screamed at her for ""knowing better."" Then she opened the back door and *threw* her out the door by the scruff of her neck.

I've trained enough dogs in my lifetime to know that you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT shove a puppy's nose into its mess. It's a puppy, it doesn't know it did anything wrong, and by the time its nose is being shoved into its own urine, it's probably forgotten that it even went to the bathroom. It's like shoving an infant's nose into its diaper. Even in the Purina puppy training video from circa. 1994 told you to absolutely not do that. Instead, you're supposed to move the puppy outside so they'll learn that that's where they're supposed to go to... well, *go*. When they *go* outside, make a huge fucking deal over it so they associate *going* in a certain place as being good behavior.

Seeing a nine-week-old puppy careening out the back door was horrifying to me. I just met WIR the week before, so I didn't know how to react. With someone I knew, I'd have lost my shit. Being that this was my boyfriend's mother and I wanted to have a good relationship with her, I sat frozen with my hand over my gaping maw as she scrubbed the floor while muttering obscenities about the ""worthless little bitch.""

Over the winter, the puppy was kept in the basement in a crate with a blanket and some food while nobody was home. They would bring her up for a little while to play with everyone, but if she stepped foot off the old comforter on the floor, WIR would grab her by the neck and put her back. If she would try to leave the blanket more than two or three times in a row, she was put back in the crate in the dark basement, where she would howl and scream into the middle of the night. The crying in itself is pretty standard puppy stuff: they'll cry until you either come get them, or they'll tire themselves out and go to sleep. Not this puppy. She would cry for six, seven, eight solid hours. I once got a text at 4am from DH that said he hadn't slept at all because she was crying the whole night. I suggested getting the loudest clock they could find and putting it with her in the basement to lull her to sleep. DH told WIR what I said, and she responded with ""I'm not wasting money on a clock for that dog! I'll get her to shut up myself!"" *Narrator: she did not get the puppy to shut up.* Several times, WIR tried to attain silence by yelling ""Shut up!"" down the stairs. Other times, she would stomp down the stairs and lock eyes with the now-silence, watchful puppy and would growl ""Lay down!"" at her. She would then stomp back up the stairs, shut off the light, and shut the door, and just as she was sure she finally had silence, the puppy would start *SCREAMING* because she was sure she would finally be let out to run around and play. Sometimes when this happened, WIR would stomp back down the stairs and kick the crate while roaring ""I said LAY DOWN!""

What I started to notice about this was, if FIL was in the house, she wouldn't do these things. He was the one who wanted to bring the puppy out to play with her. He would play with her non-stop and loved having her out. WIR would pretend to feel the same when he was in the house, but she would never take her out when he wasn't there. The puppy would be expected to lay silently in the basement with maybe one bathroom break after WIR got home from work and then FIL would take her out and play with her. She eventually learned to not go to the bathroom in the cage or else she'd have to lay in it.

It got to be spring, and WIR bought a nicely-made, insulated doghouse and a 10x10 kennel for in the yard. They got one of those wireless fences, and the collar was too big for her so they had to tie it on her. The first time she tried to run through the fence was the most painful noise I have ever heard from an animal that was not literally being torn limb from limb (livin' in the woods, y'all). WIR yelled at her ""That's what happens, you idiot!"" *She's literally never had this thing on, you bitch! How's she supposed to know?!* WIR set a couple bucket at the basement steps for her to eat and drink, but never bothered to show her where they were, so for a couple days, they would catch her eating grass and drinking out of a puddle. Finally, FIL showed her where they were ""again"" (as WIR told him that she knew where they were because WIR had shown her herself), and that dog buried her face in the water. It was like she'd never seen water before. I got pissed when DH told me that because she never would have gotten so thirsty had WIR just shown her where it was!

WIR has lots of yard decorations. The one she loves the most is her motorized water fountain. She lost her shit on the dog when she caught her drinking from it. Meanwhile the dog's water is old and hot and scummy and has bugs crawling through it and other dogs and god knows what else have been drinking it too. She's been convinced ever since that the fountain is going to run out of water and the motor is going to burn up solely because the dog drinks out of it. Evaporation is a concept that totally escapes her.

This dog is now six years old. She's incredibly territorial because she has maybe half an acre to run around in and she's never been allowed to leave it. Not even for vet visits, since the vet for the farm will come and check up on her at the house. Even those visits are few and far between because, unless she's dying, there's no reason for her to see the vet. There was a good while where they believed she was sick and the vet made some house calls, but he found that she was as skinny as she was because she was burning off the little bit of cheap food she was eating too quickly. He recommended that they start buying her food higher in fats and proteins so that she would put on weight. WIR started buying the better food, but still to this day bitches about how much money she's ""throwing away"" on dog food. She spends a whopping $45/month on dog food, last I heard. She stopped bitching about it in front of me when I told her that that's each *bag* of dog food for my parents' dog, and when she not-so-nicely asked why they would ""throw away their money like that,"" I said they'd prefer for their dog to not die.

When she's outside and either has food or the dog wants attention, she'll look at her at say ""Go lay down."" She then gets confused as to why the dog doesn't ""go lay down"" and will continue to stare up at her smiling. Maybe because nobody has ever worked with her to teach her *any* commands. FIL has taught her some, but with working odd hours and not being able to keep it up every day until she remembers, she hasn't built this log of commands she responds to like other dogs have. She can only sit because I worked with her myself until she got it, and would continue working with her every day until she remembered. But WIR is convinced and will attest to the fact that the dog is ""stupid"" because she can't follow commands *that she doesn't even know!!!*

For me, the worst part about all of this, and definitely BEC for a lot of it, is her giant collection of labrador retriever trinkets. Big-ass car magnet, sweaters, wall hangings, pillows, Christmas ornaments, an entire refrigerator'full of magnets, all saying shit like ""I LOVE MY CHOCOLATE LAB"" or ""LAB MAMA"" or ""LABS ARE THE BEST"" and the like. It bothers me so much that she has this wonderful, loving, affectionate, goofy, sweet dog, and talks to and about her like she's a burden and a piece of shit, and treats her like an irritating lawn ornament, but decorates her house and her car and her life like she's this proud ""dog mama"" to a chocolate lab that she's never put one honest ounce of effort into.

Side note: we included the dog in some of our engagement photos. Maybe I'll crop one and post it in the comments later. She was so good and made all the right faces ans was so excited to be included. 

TL;DR WIR got a puppy, abused her when she wasn't potty trained after a week of not even trying to house train her, left her locked in a crate in the basement and would scream at her to shut up when she made noise, occasionally kicking the crate in an effort to stop the puppy's crying, called her an idiot when she didn't immediately understand the invisible fence and got a serious electric shock, essentially hid the food and water from the dog, complained to me about how expensive her vet-recommended food was until I shut her down, calls her dumb because she doesn't know commands she's never been taught, but surrounds herself with magnets and decorations bragging about owning the breed of dog."
888,"I was going to move on to more MIL stories from the past-- But I have some current issues going on that I neeeed to share before I explode. The **NERVE** of this woman! Let's start with last week, shall we?

MIL was going on vacation with step-FIL. She sends my husband $50 online and says ""Have (me) feed my animals every day while I'm gone."" My husband says ""I'll ask her."" Considering she had already sent the money, I told my husband that I would. Even though it was really weird that she never once asked me herself. Fast forward to the day before she is leaving. She sends me this message with instructions on how to feed the animals and then adds ""BTW DH is to NOT be the one to do this. You pass by my town every day on your commute to work. YOU can do this yourself."" 

Excuse the fuck out of me? 

So I did it. I fed her cats. Without any pleases or thank yous. I still did it. Because that's unfortunately the kind of person I am. A pushover. 

Our wedding anniversary was this past weekend. Friday after work, I changed into my gym clothes and headed towards the gym. DH calls and informs me that his mother has the children and asked if I could pick them up. I said okay and skipped the gym. Get to MIL's house, got the kids and then we went to my moms hotel because she was in town for the weekend. Uneventful, right? On Saturday, MIL asked me to come over to get a pack n play that she wanted to get rid of. I told her no, DH and I were celebrating our anniversary and my mom was in town. I wasn't going to come over. She told me to come over anyway. I ignored her and didn't. 

***THEN YESTERDAY*** DH texts me and says: ""Everything okay with you and (me)? She wasn't dressed for work when she came and got the boys the other day. Something seemed off."" DH said he responded with ""Well that's her gym day and she didn't know you had them."" But my question is: what was she implying? Is she insinuating I am lying about my employment or is she trying to insinuate that I'm a cheater? What business is it of hers if I change my clothes? That is by far the most outlandish reach I have ever seen in my life. And to insinuate that on our anniversary of all days. Pretty sure I love my husband a LOT to put up with his bitch of a mother. 

Thank you for reading this far. I needed to vent."
889,"This is my first post on this sub, although I am a long time lurker. 
Sorry for formatting as I am on mobile (sorry for any typos as well) 

This happened a couple of hours ago, I have barely calmed down enough to slightly gather my thoughts. 

Background: This upcoming December my parents have booked a trip for us to go to Mexico for 20 days. 
I truly do not want to be down there for 20 days, I also wanted to spend the holidays at home for once. However that is not the case. My parents love to pick places to travel to and all on their own schedule. My siblings(18M, 14M &amp; 12F) and I are expected to comply and be happy about it. Never mind whether we want to or not. 
I know I sound a little spoiled or entitled but truthfully I cannot stand being around my family for so long. When we go on “vacations” we are expected to be together all day, everyday and go to every place together. My mother is a narcissist and so mean to me.  

Further on to my issue tonight, I decided to speak to my parents and ask them if they could possibly meet me in the middle so that way I would be excited about our holiday trip- rather than dreading it.
I asked them if they you let me come home halfway through. I offered to pay my way back and assume any extra fees. We travel to Mexico a lot to visit family, therefor I am comfortable with the airport and navigating it. 
They told me that I was not allowed to leave early and that I have to be with them everywhere. They don’t care what I have to say I am going and that’s final. They also said that for the next trip they’ll ask me about it before hand, but I “obviously am gonna say no I don’t wanna go because i hate my family”. So my dad kept saying ,”Well this is our last trip as a family, after this we will never go on a full family trip ever again because you so badly don’t want to be around us ever.”
Which I think is incredibly dramatic because I don’t hate my family, but I feel that being 19 going on 20 is old enough that I should be able to get a vote or a say in how I am gonna spend my time and with whom. 

So instead of a calm discussion with hope for success my parents started yelling at me and calling me names. 
My dad said, “oh so just because we won’t bow down to your will you’re just gonna be a bitch the whole time? That’s it, you’re just gonna be a bitch?”
Then proceed to say that I am nothing and do nothing. This all coming from a man who does not say more than 15 words to me a week. 
Then my mom decided to weigh in as well. 
She said that she’s sick of having someone like me living in her house and that I’m a mess with nothing to show for myself. When I brought up another reason that I wanted to come home-my best friend from grade school is being deployed Jan 1st to an active combat zone- I wanted to be able to see my friend prior to her deployment my mother started yelling at me saying, “This is why I can’t fucking stand you. You can ut everyone else above your family. Your real family. So if you come back and you see (Friend) and something happens to me while you’re gone it’ll be all fine because you at least got to see (Friend) right! 
If something ever happens to me or I die I never want you around, I don’t want someone like you around at all” 

After that i told my mom that that is the reason I do not want to spend 20 straight days with them. Because they talk to me like that and it is everyday. At that point I left the room crying. 

I’m currently hoping to see if I can stay at my friends home and slowly begin to move out prior to the trip. 
I’m hoping to solicit some advice about what I should prepare/get ready in order to leave. I do have all my important documents in my possession. I’m just unsure of what else to expect if I decide to up and leave soon. 
Thank you

EDIT: thank you all for taking the time to reply. I just wanted to say that I have been planning to move out by Summer 2020 so I have started the process of separating myself from my parents grip. I have a separate bank account because years ago when my mom had access to it she would constantly get mad at me for spending money I worked for and nit pick every transaction. That got really old really fast. They can’t track me anymore, they had begun to but I put a stop to that as soon as I possibly could. 
I luckily do have a car and it’s in my name and paid off. Thankfully I learned after the second time that if my dad or mom have a name on the title to my car they will sell it out from under me. While they did buy me my car I think it’s bad to handle a gift like that. Therefore my car now is 100% mine. I currently work and am saving up and am in school as well. My two biggest stressors are my phone plan &amp; insurance as I am still under them for both, however I’m optimistic that I qualify for Medicaid. 
Just some extra info. Thank you all again"
890,"So I found out StepMIL and FIL are visiting in a couple months. That’s fine. Our rule has always been at least 2 weeks notice and no staying with us. Both of which are being respected so I will give them that.

However, I’m religious. DH is religious. Sunday church is an important ritual to us and helps out weeks just feel better. I don’t plan I’m skipping while she is here nor do I expect her to come. But....

She’s told us that if we choose church over them it will be “very hurtful.” She’s openly hated our religion in the past. Like, full on said she was hoping we’d leave it. And that was unprovoked. She out of the blue said that she wanted us to leave our religion because she believes in God, but not organized religion or going to church. Well, I told her that would be a personal decision because I happen to enjoy my church and religion. 

Am I the asshole here? I’m not even planning on staying for Sunday School, just the sermon portion because I just don’t like missing it. It’s like pressing reset on my life when I go. My few routines I’ve got left since the baby got here are key to my sanity and church is a huge one. I k ow a lot of people don’t think this. But it helps significantly with my depression and anxiety to go. I get it’s an hour without my son as he is prone to sleeping like a log at church and I take advantage of it, but I really don’t care about hurting her feelings with how she’s talked about my faith in the past. She even at one point told me she had hoped DH would have married a girl who didn’t share his beliefs so he’d stop believing. I’m just worried I’m being unreasonable not being willing to skip a week.

ETA: thank you everyone. DH has agreed to handle this. Baby Boy will be coming with me and we are going, no matter the time it’s at. I really appreciate the respectful conversation and support as well. You all are wonderful, beautiful people."
891,"     This will have to be a few part post as it sounds too crazy to even be true.
     The MIL is gone! 54 years old and gone due to alchohol and iv drug use cirrohis. Sounds terrible, I know, but if you knew her, you would understand the abuse and horror she has caused many many people. I'll just give a few examples.
1. The first time I (DIL) met her She was sitting at her dining room table with empty pill containers as shot glasses. She proceeded to ask me to pay her 25$ rent so she wouldn't get evicted from her low income apartment. Which I did because she had a 12 y\old son in the apt. My SO is her oldest son. She was 45 then and looked 80. 
2. SO, the 12 y\old and MIL went on a float down the river. 12 y\old proceeds to walk backwards and ran into a tree (wasn't hurt) I let out a giggle as I would if it were my own child. Bad idea! MIL and SO yelled at me for being insensitive and I was sent down river alone. Got to the car and SO threw my things at me and called names. It should have been my first clue when MIL had a huge smirk on her face. She hated me. 
3. She gained disability (for drug addiction) and received a back pay check for her and her disable son (blind in one eye due to bb gun shot 12 y\old) 30,000$ for her and 7,000$ for him. She received his check first and proceeded to shop for herself new clothes. Meanwhile her 12 y\old had torn shoes and needed school clothes and supplies. I borrowed 500$ from the 12 y/old because I knew she would spend it on gambling and herself. I then took him to buy supplies and clothes with his own money. Sad. When she got her check. She blew it in casinos and who knows what. She did manage to buy a 2000$ car. All the money was gone within 2 weeks! (The 2000$ car was all He was left when she died) he wrecked it Driving it home. He is now 23 years old. 
4. Many many phone calls to my SO late at night wanting him to run her some toilet paper, gas, and anything else she could come up with to get him to take care of her. Many calls at his job. Many calls in the middle of the night because she would get drunk and fall. Broken wrist and bumps. Oh the calls!! I finally said ""NO more"". This angered the SO. That's his momma! Nobody says a bad word about her without him coming to her defense. I found it very strange. 
     Now you can kind of see what type of person she was. I tried to get guardianship of the brother to no avail. Poor kid. Never had a chance. 
     The last 4 year's SO has had NC with her. His vomiting every morning and stress hives cleared up. Hmm? I get a message from MIL best friend saying she's dying. Mind you, she's been claiming she's dying from anything and everything ever since I met her 10 years ago. So I let him know and both of us decided that it was probably just a ploy to get back in our lives so we did nothing. A month later he gets a call at work saying the same thing from the best friend. He checked into it and it was true this time. She was going on hospice for liver failure. My SO goes and buys a brand new car We cannot afford behind my back so his precious mother doesn't have to ride in our crappy car! He then walks out on me. Left! Gone! 10 years! I was in shock! This was around the first of July. She passed Sept 29. I have stage 4 metastatic terminal breast cancer. He left me stuck with a 3 bedroom house I couldn't afford alone or much less take care of. My head is still reeling. The MIL has always had an emotional incestuous relationship with her boys. Especially my SO. Sending inappropriate texts, comments and music to him. Any ideas of what happened? I have no clue. Its all so strange to me. We were getting along great. I'll be writing part 2 tomorrow. The death of a witch and revenge from the grave."
892,"Long time no post! I posted this as success but, it's sort of a mild success. I had a nice LONG break from my in-laws and it was wonderful!! So for a small recap, the last visit we think she sabotaged her motorcycle so it wouldn't start so she could try to stay longer, when I was trying to grieve from my mother's passing. So, they left her bike here and we had a shop come pick it up so they could work on it. It's been at the shop ever since.  


So, MIL &amp; FIL are supposed to come visit in September to help watch the kids since it's our 9 year anniversary but unfortunately, they had to post-pone that because FIL's classic car he's restoring wasn't finished (upholstery guy lost his sister in an accident or something). They get the run around from the guy and their ""We'll be there on the 23rd at the latest"" turned into ""Hey, we're going to come on the 30th and only stay until Sunday."" Mmmmk, I'm not very happy with this but hey, at least DH and I will get some time to go out to dinner on our own and the girls love their ""Mimi"".   


The visit goes really well. The only thing she changed was some small tin Halloween decorations that were on my steps, because FIL kept tripping on them (he's a big biker dude). She left the dishes alone, she left my room alone, she respected my rules and didn't boundary stop at all!

&amp;#x200B;

But oh hey, what are these stupid trinkets I'm finding all over the house now after their visit!!?! There was one in the bathroom, one on my side of the bed under the mattress, in the girls' rooms, in the kitchen, in the basement, etc?! Little patron saint charms. Guess what the one on my side of the bed was?? I had to look it up because I don't know them and it said St. Gerard fertility prayer for conception. Um.....sorry to break the bad news to you MIL, no more kids. The shop is closed on DH's end (we've had the verifying dr appointment to confirm that) and I have a IUD in."
893,"Wow! My MIL is on a roll.  I look at the text and think not the freaking time!  She is already invited to Halloween (I came to terms with that and my DD has an awesome costume / While MIL is all princess and cutesy, my 7 year old will be a Victorian killer with an axe.  DD picked it out!)  And then she invited herself to DD’s birthday party / which I haven’t even fully planned yet and we were going to see how she did for Halloween.  If she misbehaves, I am taking them off the list.  We live in a gated community.   They won’t be able to get in.  And now Thanksgiving.  My husband made it very clear he doesn’t want to eat his mom’s food.  I really don’t want to cook and host and we are waiting closer to decide what to do.  I have my parents and he has his brother who won’t see his mom anymore.  I said why not see them.  It’s all up in the air yet and so hubby said we will discuss it after Halloween to her which is true.  It’s really not a priority for us and we don’t want to lock into anything yet.  So this his mom’s response:  OK but I don’t know what other plans you could have but love to have you guys for Halloween I mean Thanksgiving

What part didn’t she understand? On well.. ignoring time!"
894,"So boyfriend and myself have been together a little under 4 years and aside from the issue with his mother we are a really strong and compatible couple. He’s 28 and I’m 25.

Basically the problem is that from my perspective his mother is driving a wedge between us. He still lives at home and his mother still controls his routine to the extent that he cannot skip a dinner at home unless he gives around a week’s notice without her throwing a fit. This means that impromptu cinema trips, dinners or any other event is basically off the cards, which of course makes having an adult relationship difficult at times.

When I stay over at his house not only do I have stay in the guest bedroom as she doesn’t like the idea of sex under her roof. Furthermore, I’m not allowed to stay in her house if she’s not around and if it’s found out that I have she’s angry and aggressive towards my boyfriend and his Dad.

Worst of all however is the snide comments she is making behind my back. She repeatedly has left me out of occasions by saying I’m “not family” and has made further negative comments about my nature and reasons for being with her son.  I don’t know all the details as my boyfriend has tried to keep me from the worst, however despite the fact that I’ve made repeated attempts to bond with his mother they don’t seem to be easing with time. I also know that when my boyfriend or his Dad try to defend me she cries and makes their life difficult by either being verbally abusive or guilt tripping. She seems convinced that in all this she is the victim here and all of her actions are justified.

As I have said I have tried bonding with her and have found out about her past so I know a lot of this is coming from crippling low self esteem and in so many ways I sympathise and want to help. However I’m now reaching the end of my tether, as is I believe my boyfriend. He has said he now feels like he may have no choice but to choose between myself and his mother, but of course I would never want it to come to that.

Does anyone have any advice for me or him?"
895,"I've posted previously about what my MIL did post partum which was 11 months ago (silent treatment, withholding my babies, not helping at all around the house, making me cook/serve her food, bad mouthing me to my husband behind my back, etc) and done a little other weird things since then but I have otherwise gone VLC with the in laws because of their behavior. My brother and his wife are throwing the babies their 1st birthday party where we are moving to because we move the week prior to their bday and they wanted to welcome us to their home state. MIL and FIL are invited to this, they received the invitation last week.

I opened the mail this morning and found this small package that contained a small gift (cards that were made by my SIL, who is JYSIL and I love her very much, she's an artist) with a handwritten letter.

Her letter is as follows:""Dear OP, since you enjoy gardening and cooking with your veggies, I thought you'd also enjoy these note cards that SIL made. I'm really sorry that our relationship has been on such rocky ground this past year. After getting counseling for myself and reading books about MIL, DIL relationships, I feel hopeful that our future interactions can be happier. Sometimes it's really hard to understand the different perceptions of others. Early in my marriage, I can remember my MIL's disapproval of how long I chose to nurse the girls. It was the right thing to do from my perspective but not from hers. In the future, I will try to understand where you are coming from in your decisions and not criticize. I may not always succeed, but that is my intention. When you share the babies via pics of videos, I DO appreciate it because it helps me feel like I share in their lives even if I can't be there. Having moved many times, I understand what a stressful time this is for you and hope it all goes as smoothly as possible. We hope you will be happy in (city we are moving to). We certainly will be happy you dont live so far away. Best wishes for the next chapter of your lives. Love, MIL's name""

So it sounds like to me, she still doesn't take responsibility for any of her actions, but only blames it on different perspectives. I think she is talking about not criticizing because our last interaction was her vehemently criticizing my choices in what I feed the twins. She made an innocent action for me reaching out by sending her videos, into her criticizing me and then berating us about something unrelated (wedding thank you cards from 2 years ago).

My husband would like for us to repair our relationship, but at this point, I'm under so much stress because we are moving across the country AND trying to sell our house here while securing a place to live over there, that I don't really want to deal with this. At all.  I also don't think this relationship will ever get better without a professional therapist mediating between us, has anyone ever tried this before? Unless she admits what she did to me and genuinely apologizes for it, I won't be forgiving her or letting her back into my life. Is this unreasonable?  How can I say ALL of this diplomatically? I do still have to see her at the babies bday party and I don't want it to be THAT awkward (because I know there will be some level of awkwardness no matter what). Has anyone's JNMIL woken up and changed?

Thanks guys!

EDIT: So just to add a bit of backstory to this, some have mentioned that she's going the extra mile by reading books/counseling. She always does this, reads ""articles"" to gain insight on things, she is ALWAYS on her ipad reading things and will even use this to avoid helping people in the house. Anyways, around April she sent my husband and I an article on traditional korean post partum care, which is in a sense crazy since I'm american born and have never been to korea (although my ethnic background is korean). She stated she gained so much insight on this and had wished she had read this prior to visiting post partum and it would have changed a lot. I don't know how her giving me the silent treatment, and not helping me out at all around the house, then shit talking me to my husband behind my back has anything to do with the fact that I'm korean.

Someone else asked if I had told them how I feel. Yes, but only briefly and they follow up with how they in fact were not hurtful, and that I was actually the one that hurt them. Anytime MIL or FIL say something remotely like an apology for the situation (not for what they did), they immediately end their email/letter with ""lets just move on"" or ""please let not go back and dredge up the past"" or ""water under the bridge"". EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."
896,"I’ve given a name to my JNS(tep)Mum: Lady Menopause, because it seems to be hitting her especially hard. 

Sorry, it got long. TLDR at the end. 

Quick context: my family is Orthodox and everyone from (home country) is also Orthodox. 

JYDad decided that we’d start our Sunday night dinners up again. I’m completely okay with this because since JYDad and Lady Menopause got back from their trip to (home country), we’ve been good. 

Nothing lasts though. 

I was hanging out in the kitchen with Lady M while she makes dinner and I brought up the celebrant we were thinking of using that was recommended by our venue as she’d been there many times before. When we looked her up I saw there seemed to be a photographer you could hire with the celebrant (that’s how this got brought up). 

Lady M questioned if we’d talked about having a religious celebrant. I told her no, because we didn’t want one. 

FDH isn’t religious and I only really follow being an Orthodox (VERY loosely) because it’s part of our culture from (home country) because everyone follows that religion. 

She started in on how I should look into it (spoiler: I won’t) because if I want to baptise my kids to be Orthodox, I have to get married Orthodox. 

I’m calling bullshit right there because it seems a lot of couples aren’t getting married and still having kids. Even baptised. 

Well, fuck me, because that isn’t right. 

I agreed to look into it to shut her up and left to join FDH on the couch. JYDad sat down with Lady M so I didn’t want to say anything, so I sent him; “Lady M’s saying if we wanna baptise our kids as (home country) Orthodox we need to get married (home country) Orthodox. I really cbf. Whatever”

It was chill again. We were all just hanging out. Lady M mentioned a couple of times that she’s not looking forward to B1 moving back in with them (he’s 29 and VERY dependant on our JYDad and no real help around the house (he’s actually the opposite)). JYDad tried calling B1 some more and he finally gets there. So we sit for dinner. 

Mac n cheese which Lady M has gushed and gushed about how good it is and instructing FDH on how she made it (granted he was actually interested in which cheeses she used). 

While we’re sitting our wedding gets brought up again and JYDad asks who we’re having MOH and BM. We tell them we’re not having any of that (we’ve got 25 people including us) because it’s just family. 

They start on how we need them because we need a witness. (We researched it and we actually need 2 in our state of our country)

Umm... pretty sure we can ask prior for people to be witnesses and not have them be part of the bridal/groom party (we’re going to meet with our celebrant on Saturday and discuss this stuff to make sure). 

Anyway, it ends up being brought back to the celebrant and Lady M says to both of us exactly what she’d just said to me privately. 

We really need to think about if we want a religious celebrant because if we don’t get married Orthodox, then we can’t baptise our children Orthodox and they can’t “receive their name”. 

Smart ass I am said that they’d get names whether they’re baptised or not. Lol. She meant the Orthodox name. 

To summarise the argument: 


•	FDH and I want our kids to choose their own religion; whatever they feel comfortable with. We got looks from my family as though we were crazy. 


•	Lady M questioned my beliefs and I told her I believe there’s something, but not a god. She then told me I just didn’t believe (this was repeated multiple times). 


•	Lady M questioned why I was letting before Easter if I don’t believe. I told her it was because it was our country’s culture. She just looked like I was talking crazy and B1 kept referencing (current country’s) culture (I want to smack him so hard). 


•	Theres was a minor interval for me when I went to the toilet (at least 10 minutes) and they were still going on about this shit. 


•	Lady M TOLD me I don’t believe. 


•	Lady M referenced our trip to Rome where we went to the Vatican and mistook my awe of the beauty of it for awe at feeling something spiritual and kept repeating this, feeling it to be true even though I kept correcting her. 

(Edit: she also told me I wasn’t Orthodox when I told her I wanted to be cremated. The look on her face was along the lines that I had major disfigurements on my face and she was truly disgusted)

Eventually JYDad had had enough and got up off the table and left telling Lady M her voice was all he could hear and Lady M telling him the same (I could barely hear JYDad over Lady M) and I took the queue to tell her I’d had enough of the conversation and I was changing the subject. I had to repeat this a couple of times (because she kept trying to continue the conversation) to which I just completely changed the subject and she shut up completely. 

We moved back to the couch and B1 told everyone he was leaving. We took our queue again and left too. 

Lady M followed us out (as she always does) and tried one last time to continue the conversation to which I loudly started saying ‘BYE!’ and we left. 

Side note: JYDad loaded us off with the rest of the Mac n cheese (half the very large pot) to take home because we’re most likely to finish it. 

Lady M called me at 9:16pm to ask if we’d heated it up yet, I foolishly said no and she started giving me instructions on how to do so. Bitch, please. She told me these exact instructions before on other dishes. I KNOW! 

And she told me she’d get JYDad to talk to me. I told her no, I had to get ready for work (night shift) and she still tried to drag the conversation on. 

TLDR: Lady Menopause pushes religion on us, looks at us like we’re crazy when we don’t agree with her opinion and B1 is a massive shit stirrer."
897,"It’s exactly as the titles says. About a year ago, she bought the house right next door on our small cul-de-sac. 

I don’t even know where to begin. She was looking to move down south where we are, which we were semi-okay with but then the house right next door went up for auction and she fucking bought it. I was steaming mad but there was nothing I could really do about it. 

So this summer, in June, she decides she wants to go up north for a week or so to visit and if we could watch her chickens. We agreed to get rid of her.She left in June and came back today. We were stuck watching her chickens for almost five months. My husband also kept up her lawn but didn’t weed, which she is very upset about. She hasn’t offered any money for the chickens’ food or time spent cleaning their coop and letting them out numerous times a day. When I told her how much the food was costing us every month, she said, “aren’t they such piggies? Hehehehe” 

This isn’t even the bulk of it. She gave us cockroaches because she had them and kept bringing shit over our house when we told her not to. 

I just want to pack up and go. I love my husband so much, but damn. I really, really can’t take it. 

A couple additional things while I’m venting;

-  she flipped out when FIL died because she didn’t receive anything in the will. She divorced him 20 years ago and cleaned him out then

- she shows up to my house randomly and walks right in if the door isn’t locked. 

- I pissed her off one time and she demanded a 20 page apology letter before I was allowed back in her house 

- she bought me new clothes that were two sizes too big and told me that I would grow into them 

- she sneaks up to our house to dump her trash in our bins so she doesn’t have to pay for trash service 

- she holds things over my husband’s head. If she wants house work or whatever done, she’ll mention something she did for him years ago. 

- she co-signed a car loan for us years ago, and when my husband was a couple weeks late on a payment, she went and had the car repossessed. 


Edit: I have gone and done it. I’m in trouble now with DH. I showed him this post and I told him I had a question to ask him and he said, “If you’re going to just be a fucking bitch, then I don’t want to hear it.” And he’s been ignoring me since. 

So I might not respond to anyone that quick. I’m still trying to clean the house rn because the exterminators are coming tomorrow for the roaches his mother gave us.

Edit 2:  Y’all I’m okay. I got upset a little after his comment but I try not to let things bother me.


I just finished cleaning. I’ve noticed my phone blowing up for hours and DH noticed as well, but we were busy cleaning. I was not expecting this type of response. I totally appreciate everybody and I appreciate all the supportive PM’s I’ve gotten. DH looked really upset and has been scrolling this post from his own phone for the past ten minutes. He’s pretty quiet and seems a little reflective so I guess we shall see? That’s all I have for now. 

I’m going to now try and respond to people."
898,"I recently gave birth to my first child. My in laws were terrible and highly obnoxious.

To begin, I found out my fil and mil planned on coming to stay in my home for 2 weeks directly following the birth at our Chinese wedding ceremony (im Irish, my DH is chinese). Dh's uncle asked my mil if they were going to visit the hospital when my son was born, and she replied that she was going to stay with us for 2 weeks. She did not discuss this with us. Later, when I told her that this would not be happening, she told me that she HAD to stay so she could boil eggs and dye them red everyday and set them around our house. While I respect their culture, it does not trump my need for privacy and family bonding time. If she had asked or even been slightly polite about the situation, I may have found a compromise. Of course they were ""so heart broken"" that I would not let them come harrass me for 2 weeks, because its all about them.

The next day she tells me ""i may not be coming for two weeks, but when the baby turns a month old you are going to have A LOT of people at your house."" In chinese culture they shave the baby's head at a month old and have a small ceremony. I had no qualms about shaving the baby's head or having my in laws visit for a day or two at that time, but i did not want my child who has not yet had his vaccines passed around like a football between every member of his family. Mil had already made arrangements for the entire family to visit without our knowledge. She was upset when I told her she would have to cancel everything.

When they found out what I was going to name my baby, they threw a fit for weeks and told me i was not allowed to name my child the name i had chosen. They pestered me to change it over and over.

Fast forward to the birth! The moment they arrive at the hospital mil sits down on the couch and says ""i hope you dont mind if we stay for the afternoon, we have nowhere else to go."" So rude. She is an adult and could have gone and had lunch or made some arrangement. Fil then tells me to get up and walk around! I refuse. Mil again brings up the one month visit, which Dh had warned her not to do. Dh then goes to change the baby, and the in laws literally RUN through the hospital room to hover over him.

Fil yells ""THERE'S POOP!!!"" I tell him no, it is not poop, it is ointment for his circumcision, and please do not wipe it off. He repeats ""THERE'S POOP!!!""  two more times, and I have to physically restrain him from wiping the ointment off. Fil then exclaims ""HES BLEEDING!!"" I explain to him that yes, after a circumcision there is bleeding. He ignores me and repeats himself over and over. He then tells me I am burping the baby too hard over and over, exclaiming ""THATS MY GRANDSON!"" until I firmly tell him to STOP and ask them to leave.

After all of this, I stupidly agree to let them come by the house for an hour before they left for home. They live 4 hours away and we didnt know when we would be seeing them again. I explained that I wanted to get home and settle in and I would call them when they could come by. Mil is texting repeatedly while Im still in the hospital ""it is 3 pm! Arent you leaving yet?!"". She is calling us on our drive home. Again, go have lunch or do something with yourself. So glad my memory of that first drive home will be tainted by her badgering calls. They came over for 30 minutes and left, thank god.

And its only getting worse! They constantly repeat unsolicited advice. At 7 weeks we had a visit for three days and I nearly lost my mind. We are not visiting for thanksgiving, as i need a break for them for an extended period. I want my son to have his grandparents in his life, but he is only 3 months old and doesnt know the difference right now and i just cannot take it.

ETA: Thank you everyone for the great advice. I feel so much better and equipped to deal with this bull. I am not alone!"
899,"I’m new here, but definitely not new to MIL maniacs. I’ve been dealing with mine for 11 years now...

For 2 years we were estranged from my in-laws due to the way that they unfairly treat husband‘s sister and her kids compared to us and ours. Theres a whole bunch of other reasons why, but just want to put it all behind me now.  —-Just trust me when I say I’m not her favorite daughter in law, and she’s always made that very clear. 

Since around this time last year, We have been trying to bury the hatchet, but still keep the boundaries we set. We let her come to our sons kindergarten graduation last summer, and we visited over at her house. Which is a lot for us after not having to deal with her shit for two peaceful years. 

Anyways, I *REALLY* don’t want her around on special days that take place in my home. I want to enjoy my kids and be present with them on their special day, and I can’t do that when she’s around. 

Typically we invite my immediate family over for some cake and presents. We don’t go all out for b-days, just my parents, my two sisters and their kids usually. The kids run around, the adults chat on the porch, it’s very relaxed and unofficial, but important to us non the less. 

So this morning at the ass crack of dawn she messages me on FB and asks when my sons b-day is because shes coming.  She hasn’t been to single one of my kids b-days either by choice, or because we weren’t talking to them...

This is rude right? Inviting herself to my house for a party I haven’t even planned yet...? My daughter b-day was last month and she didn’t ask about it until after the fact... and was hurt we didn’t invite her. I said it wasn’t personal, it was just a very informal b-day. 

I just don’t feel like I can enjoy my kids days with that drama looming over our heads... 

How do I tell her to gtfo without stirring the pot?


ETA: My hubs has always supported me 💯 he doesn’t want her around either."
900,"Idk where to start. 

My in laws always hated me (25f). They never wanted me to wed their son (30m). However, we got married and they were at least pleasant in my company so I was fine with that. They got super involved with me when I was pregnant but as soon as I gave birth I was again just someone they said hi and bye to whenever they'd come to visit. 

However, shiz hit the fan when they came over for my kids 2nd birthday. My family and my husband's family was invited plus some co-workers. The party was set at 3. They came at 12 and played with the baby all the way until 3 when the baby got tired so I took her down for a nap. My family had not arrived yet as my mom was working and she was going to be late, my sister was sick with the flu, and my brother was dealing with a new born baby. The coworkers who were supposed to come also said they couldn't make it last minute. My family came late but they all had valid excuses and the baby was sleeping anyway. 

30 minutes go by and MIL is already asking when I'm going to wake up the baby. I say I'm not waking her up because then she'd just be fussy from being overtired. but she keeps asking and asking. Finally after 2 hours my FIL gets up and starts yelling a bunch of mean stuff about me and my family and then promptly left with MIL just as my family was arriving.

I later told them that I wish they wouldn't have left as the baby was finishing her nap and I wanted them to celebrate with her but that I also did not appreciate what was said and that going fwd I wanted respect in my home. They. Blew. Up. Told me a bunch of more nasty things and that was it. 

I wanted to move on from this but I felt like I couldn't until they apologized for what was said about me and my family. I asked my husband to ask for an apology and they said no and then blew up again saying more mean stuff and that I needed to apologize to them because my family was late to the party. 

They now want to see my daughter and husband at their place (3hrs away). I do not feel comfortable with this. I just don't see how they can disrespect me and then feel entitled to spend time with my daughter. My husband thinks it's fine for him to take our daughter to see them and I just stay at home but it makes me feel like no one gives a care about me. Like, it's okay to disrespect me and say mean things about me because I'm nothing and they're entitled to my daughter. 


This whole situation makes me feel bad because I truly wanted to have a good relationship with them but I feel like the damage is irreperable and I 100% will never trust them to not talk negatively about me to my husband or daughter. As of right now I don't want them to have any contact with me or my daughter until time heals the hurt I feel over what they said. Only once I feel comfortable being around them again would I be willing to meet somewhere so they can see my daughter.  But that's just what I'm thinking. Im writing this post to help answer what I should do regarding them visiting my daughter or what my next steps to get this issue fixed should be?

Tldr in-laws have been disrespectful to me but still want to see grandchild. What do I do?

Edit: I want to thank everyone that shared their experiences as well as those that gave me advice on what I should do. I showed my husband the thread which didn't make him too happy. However, after reading your responses he did tell ILs that they will not be seeing LO and that they need to respect me. I feel... Proud? of him. I don't know how to explain it but at the same time I'm also worried that the rift this whole situation caused will effect our relationship in the long term. So far, no word from ILs but I can tell my husband is worried about it."
901,"I’m so happy and I wanted to share in this sub because we go through a lot with our MILs and there have been times when I felt like giving up in my relationship because I didn’t have the energy to deal with her. 
But DH grew a spine and went NC with her after the last call when she called me sick, obstacle and insisted for 20 min he should break up with me. 
We got married in a little town we both love, I told my parents who are very happy for us and encouraged him to share the good news with his; but said that MIL would ruin the special moment with her bad energy so he didn’t contact her. 
Today, because FIL follows me in social media, I asked him if he felt ready to share the news with him, he said yes and we recorded it as we recorded my parents reaction too. FIL is happy for us. Asked if MIL knows (they divorced since DH was 1 yo) and DH said no, not in the mood yet, so FIL said he’ll probably be in a lot of trouble. MIL is said to be this authoritarian type A personality with no filters, I think there’s a line between being rude and being type A. When I asked if he was planning to call today, he said he doesn’t want to do it because MIL doesn’t like him, I corrected him and told him she doesn’t like me, but loves him; he said that he loves me so if someone is against me he wants nothing to do with them. I feel bad because he’s the only child, but as I’ve read here “if you’re mean, you’ll get mean treatment”.
 So DH and I are enjoying the bliss of marriage (we were already living together and paying everything together, so getting married made it more official, but the commitment and love has been here before we signed the paper). 
I’m jumping in one leg and I wanted to share this with you, I’m thankful for all of your support on my precios posts. 
Wish you the best with your SO and MILs."
902,"There’s so much to say about how awful my MIL (and really the whole side of that family) has been to me since day one. There’s been non stop drama and disrespect (admittedly on both sides) but the way my MIL goes about things is just malicious. She’s so sneaky, petty &amp; backhanded about stuff that it makes me question my sanity. Am I being crazy? Am I overreacting? But clearly I’m not, as she enjoys the drama I believe. 

She has maintained close contact with my husband’s ex girlfriend the entirety of our relationship. She has blatantly expressed that the ex holds a place in her heart that I just can’t compete with and has reminded me of this countless times through out the almost four years I’ve known her.

I’m currently 8 months pregnant and this whole pregnancy has just been filled with anxiety and hurt. I don’t want to revoke her “rights” to my daughter, but I don’t want to let her have a relationship with my child after years of bullying and antagonistic behavior directed to me and my relationship with my husband. 

I’m also really mad because she hosted a baby shower for the ex but never even mentioned having as much as a dinner for my husband and I &amp; our daughter. We live in WA state, I’m from NC. My mother hosted a baby brunch for my family and close friends a few weeks ago. We flew to NC for that, obviously without inviting husband’s family (because why would we?) We actually still need several things on my registry though and not to sounds entitled, but everyone I know usually has a baby shower on both sides (especially in situations like this, where the families aren’t close in relationship or proximity). I could be over reacting about that but it still makes me so mad that she hosted a baby  shower for my husband’s ex girlfriend and her husband. 

Part of me is so bitter, I don’t want to let her have a relationship with me or my daughter. I don’t think she deserves it honestly. My husband is on the same page. He is really sickened over his mother’s behavior and has called her out multiple times over her absurd behavior. 

Anyone with a similar situation?? What did you do? What should I do?? U G H"
903,"**trigger warning miscarriage**
My JNMom &amp; I have a fun history of narcissist martyr behavior ; maybe I’ll get into that all later but for now I’m focusing on my current issue &amp; future problems. I’m luckily pregnant after having a miscarriage earlier this year, &amp; pretty much everyone in our lives is pretty excited. My JNMom is already trampling boundaries left &amp; right. First offense in my mind is calling my child *Herrrr baby* nope just mine &amp; DH kid. She auto-invited herself into my L&amp;D when the time comes, which just no. She gives me such anxiety &amp; pisses me off(sorry if that’s shitty to say but literally her antics make me so mad) I know it wouldn’t be peaceful for me for her to be there. She wants to come down to my ultrasound appointments to see the kid but mind you the whole time I’ve lived away she’s never made any effort to come see me &amp; I believe that’s something special for DH &amp; I. Who knows if we’ll go through this again &amp; I want us to be able to cherish it. I told her no, she follows up with “well make sure you get a really good video next to the machine because I want to hear the heartbeat” ummmmm I was going to do that for myself but where do you get off demanding this? She keeps pushing me to make my announcement on the book of faces and my other social media’s so she can post about how she’s going to be a grandmother like wtf. I was going to post regardless but why do you have to make your own post? 2+2=4 if I’m pregnant you’re a grandma I don’t see the point aside from feeding her own ego to rehash my post to gear it to her becoming a grandma; But I digress. JNMom wanted to come stay with me in my house three weeks postpartum “to help with the baby” while simultaneously getting a major surgery that would honestly render her unable to help me with my child, I’ll be recovering myself anyways, &amp; she’d be bringing another large rambunctious animal to add to my already mini zoo. So I tell her no that’s not a good idea, I can’t handle it etc. Then the subject of her being at L&amp;D or even visiting after the delivery I’m requesting everyone get the flu shot &amp; TDAP if they see LO before they get their own vaccinations. Just general preference of safety for my baby.  She flips I mean loses it “***I knew you’d come up with stipulations to keep me from my grand baby and I will be doing my own research because none of the other babies I’ve been around have gotten sick so I don’t see the point***” I just told her it seemed like she made her decision &amp; left it at that. 
I may be overreacting but from our history I know this is but the beginning of a long fight &amp; I’m proud of myself for even setting boundaries. This was cathartic to even share so I’ll take that release.

**Edit** I haven’t had a chance to reply to everyone individually but I really want to tell you all how much I appreciate the support. It’s reassuring it’s not all crazy pregnancy hormones but valid concerns on my part."
904,"My fiancé my son and I currently have been staying at MILs house for 4 months now. We are supposed to be moving next month. Being here has taught me a lot about my MIL. I noticed that my SO does pretty much EVERYTHING for her which sometimes interferes with our plans and causes us to use our savings which is for the move so we’re on a tight budget. My SO tells me to watch my spending and makes me feel bad when I want to do something for fun that involves money. That’s problem #1. #2 MY MIL interferes with me disciplining my now 3 year old son which causes him not to listen to me and I look like the bad guy. #3 I’m always there for my SO and what he’s going through and everything he does for her without running it by me until the decision is already made between them but when it comes to what I have to do / going on he tells me it’s not as important than what he has to do for her. 4, we wanted to take my son to Disneyland for his birthday which just passed and once MIL heard about it she wanted to pay for everything without asking me if that was okay with a credit card that’s not even hers, and fast forward to that day the tickets were purchased in advance for THE WRONG PARK which caused a big issue for us getting in. The whole time we were there MIL was complaining about everything for being hungry and tired to her leg hurting and needing my SO to push her in a wheelchair etc. I’m pregnant and I don’t even complain that much. My sons birthday was partially ruined. I was so upset I cried. There’s so much more to this it’s insane. #5 MIL prefers to speak to my SO only in Spanish especially when I’m around so I’m hardly ever included in conversations. 6, MIL has no sense of common curtesy and makes a lot of things about her. SO doesn’t want to talk to her about anything that conflicts with what she wants bc she’s allowed us to stay in her home and I hate to sound ungrateful or problematic. But my SO and I are constantly fight over this woman and stressing over her issues he takes his frustration out on me. He told me he would forever be her servant because she was always there for him growing up and that it won’t be this way once we leave. But I feel like I have no room in his life sometimes even though he tells me I wouldn’t be around if he didn’t love me. I’m so Fed up and I cannot wait to leave in a few weeks but right now I’m extremely stressed and hurt."
905,"We have stayed firm to our you come visit us b/c we are allergic to cats boundary.  And have invited Turditzen to our home several times but she's been busy. We even invited her to a family outing.  So DH gets a text that says she bought LO some cute clothes and to expect a special delivery this week what delivery slot time would be OK?  I was like how is she sending this via first class Fed Ex??? Upon closer read of her crazy text messaging she meant she would come by and drop it off.  (So she invited herself for a drop by) Now she's done this in the past with B-day presents etc and she has NEVER stayed for more than 10-20 minutes so its annoying but not a full visit .  It always makes me feel bad though b/c its an hour trip and I would never drive an hour one way just to drop something off I just won't do it.  Unless I'm being paid! So she's stopping by tomorrow with the gifts, at least she asked......ugh...Why does this feel like we were manipulated into this visit?  Or am I being a jerk? 

Also while On the phone with DH arranging this  he mentioned on her cousin dotes on her .  Turditzen immediately has to know when else we've seen SIL/BIL/Nephew(3)  and says no we hadn't seen them since we were all together in July but Nephew always ask about our LO etc.   Rolling eyes on the how dare you get together without me talk."
906,"Hi, I’m on my way back to campus after fall break. I finally changed my Instagram password in the car, so Picture Perfect most likely won’t see it until she gets back home from dropping me off. I know it’s going to cause an inevitable shitstorm, as so many things have already. 

Being home wasn’t completely awful, but it wasn’t pleasant either. Before I even set foot in the house she was asking if I got weighed at school (I’m on the smaller side and she fixates on my weight to the point where it has negatively impacted my body image). She made comments on my body hair, how I must not be shaving at school, more comments about brushing my teeth. Just a bunch of things that whittled away at me and made me wish I was back at school. 

Her behavior while I was at school was even worse though. She’s sent more long ranting texts like the one I described in my last post. She accused me of being “on something” after I got annoyed at her for accusing me of not doing something that I said I did. Multiple texts berating me if I didn’t respond or didn’t respond quickly enough. A few posts back i said I wasn’t going to allow her to see my grades, but she eventually guilt tripped me into allowing access. I eventually went back and changed the settings, but what I didn’t know was that the system would send an email to my mother telling her that her access had changed, so of course that caused another lecture. 

I want to just be, without having to worry about what I’ll get criticized for today or tomorrow or next week. I’m ambivalent about advice, this is more of a vent. 

Also, no comments about going no contact or getting a restraining order. They’re impractical at this point in my life."
907,"It is my Husband's birthday in two weeks and his mom, my MIL will be in town for two days and wants to take him out to Dinner for his birthday. I agreed to go with because I don't want her talking about me behind my back which she has the tendency to do when she is alone with my husband. I had the worse nightmare last night about the dinner which I woke up shaking and almost crying from. So just looking for some advice. 

Her latest and greatest thing that has been upsetting her is that I have deleted her from IG and FB and all social media sites since she wouldn't stop judging and asking about every single thing I do and picture I post, and I shouldn't have to be worried about what she is going to think if I post a certain picture. Three of the best examples of this are I would post a cute baby thing in my IG story and she would call my husband freaking out asking if I was pregnant and why didn’t we tell her. It was a picture of a onesie. No birth announcement nothing. I posted a picture of a puppy and we got lectured on that. I posted a picture of my sisters on sister day and didn’t include Husbands sister. And got lectured about that. Enough was enough. 

She has asked my husband on 3 separate occasions why I deleted her and blocked her and he hasn't given her an answer. He has just brushed it off every single time. I know that she is going to bring this up when she sees me. I know she will ask me. And I need advice on how to answer this question, because it isn't based on one single thing. I did it because she doesn't like me and she has made that pretty clear throughout the past 5 years DH and I have been together.  I am just sick of feeling judged and criticized on everything that I do. If I want to get a puppy you have no fucking say. The things I want to say when she asks me are, ""You ruined my rehearsal dinner, and made me cry and have nightmares the night before my wedding. Told DH not to marry me on more than one occasion. You whined and cried you and SIL weren't involved in wedding planning, but then couldn't even show up to my Husband &amp; I's wedding shower. You actually called my husband and ruined the surprise that my sister was throwing up a surprise couple's shower. You show favoritism like there is no tomorrow. You’re rude to me. You judge &amp; criticize everything I do. You made comments about my weight numerous times when you should be the one taking your own advice. I could keep going.."" 

I am just sick of her walking all over me. And I know I should just drop the rope. I just want her to be held accountable for her actions. She never has been, and we never bring up the past. We just act like it never happened and try to move on, and yet here we are. Continuing to let her treat and act this way and I am done. I just want to have a good answer for when she asks, why did you delete me, and I don't want to just let this go like I do everything else."
908,"So my boyfriend, (Let’s just call him J) has two younger brothers, C and JJ. C is 9 and JJ is 3. His grandparents passed away suddenly and his parents have been driving him to near suicide. They have 4 dogs that J has to constantly clean up after and take care of. His little Brother JJ eats through a feeding tube due to being born premature, so my boyfriend is bathing, clothing, feeding, taking to-and-from school, and is all around raising his baby brother. His middle brother, C, never has to do anything because he’s “too young” and when my boyfriend got a job opportunity out of state, his parents called the employer that was looking to hire J, and told them that he was “not good enough” and a “lousy worker with horrible work ethic.”

His mother is using the death of her parents and exploiting it to the point where she does nothing. She hasn’t been to work in months, his dad does nothing also. They both insist on him being lazy, when he wants to go out with friends or hang out with me because he doesn’t want to take his younger brothers to go hang out with a bunch of 18 year olds.

My boyfriend is jobless, due to his parents, raising a 3 year old full time, and has no social life anymore because he can’t do anything without having to take his brother with him.

Today, his mother told him that the entire house needed to be cleaned before she got home from work (she works from 7-5, and he’s on sleeping pills and doesn’t usually wake up until 10) and had to do this while not only watching his little brother, but cleaning up dog shit because his parents never potty-trained their dogs when they were puppies/when J was little.

We do have 1 friend that has offered to let my boyfriend stay with him if he needed, but he won’t take the plunge. His mental health is suffering and he won’t listen to me when I tell him to just write a note saying goodbye, pack his shit, and leave. They blame the fact that his younger brother isn’t in daycare on the fact that my boyfriend is jobless, when that shouldn’t be his responsibility in the first place. My boyfriends parents are overbearing on the idea that his younger brothers are his responsibility, when they’re not even his kids. My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years now and I’ve never once seen his mother spend time with her two younger sons, let alone cook dinner or do their laundry. It’s all been things my boyfriend has picked up doing himself because she’s threatened to kick him out if he doesn’t.

I’m writing this for some more advice on what we should do. He has a truck to leave in, that belongs to him, but it’s in his mothers name because he doesn’t have the money to pay the insurance. So if he walked out with the truck, they could technically report it stolen. Any help is welcome."
909,"Long story short, SO and I stopped living together a year ago and took a bit of a break after 7 years together because I had some mental health struggles and took the last year getting back on my feet. 

Now, in the last few months I have secured a job in my field, bought a car, my depression and anxiety are managed, and this past weekend SO and I got a new place together! I am overjoyed!!! SO was living back with his parents, and being there every weekend was absolute hell. Nothing worth mentioning because this is a happy post! 

The thing that makes me the most happy is our two cats. FMIL hated our cats and always kept them locked in SO’s room or in the unfinished basement. They got sick twice, and they stopped being affectionate, they were jumpy/would run away if you approached them, and peed everywhere. Now, 24 hours in the new house, they have done a complete 180!! I can tell the different in their moods. They are so happy!! They are having so much fun exploring, and now they are both sound asleep next to me on the couch- a place they weren’t allowed to be at FMIL’s house. Seeing them feel right at home makes me so happy. Sometimes I would cry listening to the way FMIL would talk to them/about them. 

I am also so excited to only have to see her at family get togethers, and to never have to stay at that house again for a weekend and feel uncomfortable the whole time. This is awesome!!"
910,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on this sub using a throwaway but I've been lurking for quite some time on my main account. I really don't know if this is the correct place to post - if not, feel free to direct me to another sub.

My SO and I are having family at our place this upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.

We've invited MIL/FIL, my parents, and a few members of each side of our families (grandparents, aunts and uncles etc.) There will be about 15 of us there in total, and my anxiety is already through the roof about it because of the way my MIL acts, especially when she is drunk. She drinks at every single family dinner, gets too drunk and says inappropriate things. She will slur her words, get sloppy and give people unwanted kisses/hugs, get loud and obnoxious and opinionated and she has ZERO FILTER. 

At first I did not even want to extend the invite to my extended family, which is sad because I love them all so much and want to spend the holiday with them, but I just didn't want to have them.. deal with her, I guess? I am not worried so much about my parents in this situation as they've been to events with MIL before and know how to handle her (my mom personally has shut her down a few times when she's started with bullshit) - however, this is the first time many of my extended family have been to a gathering with her that requires them to see her more than just in quick passing. I'm nervous because I know if she gets drunk (which she will) she will make things awkward for everyone.

**To give a quick run-down on MIL, she:**

* Verbally abuses FIL, in front of myself and SO/verbally abuses SO, in front of myself and FIL
* Blows up at FIL/SO for no reason then cries and plays victim when they confront her on her shit 
* Enters our home whenever she wants when we are not home just to be nosy and snoop around
*  Is a functioning alcoholic and cannot even eat a meal, go out to a meal, do housework/yard work/chores without a drink
* Gets drunk and makes inappropriate questions/comments to us/other family members 
* Constantly comments on the weight/appearance of others and belittles those who are not ""petite"" like her, including family members 

We don't keep alcohol in our house (for no other reason than SO and I are not huge drinkers - a few times a year socially, and when we purchase alcohol it's only enough for the event/party we'll be attending) but I know MIL will bring her own and get drunk at our house, or show up drunk. 

With regard to my SO - he will try to tone her down a few notches when she becomes belligerent, but sometimes will just chalk it up to ""this is the way she is"" and shrug it off. Both him and FIL have been verbally abused by MIL their entire lives and they've just become apathetic toward it because it's all they're used to. 

How do I handle this and keep her as under control as possible so I don't lose my shit/she doesn't upset or embarrass my entire family on this day??"
911,"So I recently accepted the fact that my mom is full on JN. I always knew that she wasn’t there when I needed her or supportive. 

Basically around 3 - 4 weeks ago my JNMom and I got into an argument over the phone where I had enough and spilled my heart out to her. I said all the things I had pent up for years. I did not tell I hate her or anything, but I did say we needed a break. She agreed. 

So 4 days or so after all of that went down she starts messaging me stuff like how she got a new car and then a few days after that about a tattoo she got. Then a few days after that she messaged again about another tattoo. There were a few other moments but basically it was all about her. Except one instance when she ask when my concerts were. It sounds caring but she uses it as a photo op.

I only replied to the first two messages other than that I’ve been ignoring her. I know that she is trying to rug sweep. It just hurts that she hasn’t asked how I am. Idk what to do I just wished she cared. 

I know I said advice wanted but some TLC would be appreciated as well."
912,"This is a story when i let my guard down and went on a ‘family vacation’ with my in laws. Usually we go with my family every year. 

My SO is the scapegoat child. That means whenever my in laws have a ‘family vacation’, we are not included. We’re never informed. There was one time his mother called him literally from the airport, just to brag about how they’re on their way to a vacation. She bragged about paying for his mooching older siblings, the golden’s F buddy, and the kids. 

When she sensed that my spouse was annoyed (understandably). His mom suddenly turned her switch around. MIL gave him a half ass invitation to join them. SO rejected it. (Because we cant just take day offs like that!) Then MIL made FIL bombarded my spouse phone to join them, then they offered to pay for my spouse plane ticket. 

I was laughing so hard when he told me, because they couldn’t make it so blatantly clear that they don’t want me around. All MIL’s whining about ‘Fah-me-leeey’ apparently did not include me. We could pay our way, but would you? Why would i want to spend my hard earned money with those toxic assholes? Anyway, SO still rejected it. Then from everything i heard their vacation went to shit. 
———————————————-

Came the next year, SO agreed. 

(Unfortunately for me.) 

This time, MIL offered to pay for hotel room for us. I was surprised actually. I thought i could stand MIL for three days. I was wrong. 

They’re staying in their vacation studio next to ‘what supposed’ to be our hotel. Our flight arrived late. When we arrived, MIL has checked into our room, used the pool, used the towels, and showered in the room. Even better, they left a golden ‘gift’ in the bathroom, because my in laws never fucking flush. 

Okay, whatever, they paid for the room. 

The next day, MIL announced that she likes staying at the hotel room better, and made us switched. Thats the story about how MIL paid for a half day hotel room for us. 

Even better, because MIL has the key to the place where we stayed. She kept coming in and out, and stayed for hours. I made the mistake of leaving my toiletries bag on all splayed out on the dining table while i was showering. I have a bottle of lube and condoms inside the bag. Except that, it was not used because his parents kept showing up. 

When we returned from the vacation, we used the lube. At first i thought it was just me, then my SO asked if i feel the burn. Holy fuck. It was burning! We opened the lube bottle and it smelled like hot sauce. FIL likes hot sauce. MIL carried his hot sauce for him in her purse. FIL is nice. MIL is a bitch. You can guess who is the suspect. 

That was one genital burning lesson to never. ever. fucking go on a vacation with my in laws ever again."
913,"My first post here. I (26F) have 2 MILs that I can’t stand and I don’t know if it’s me being over dramatic or if I actually have reason to dislike them.

One of them, MIL Prime, is sticky sweet on the outside but has a reputation for being back-stabbing, gossipy, and fake. She is the type who wants everything to appear to be perfect and if you don’t go along with it, you are on her shit list.

For instance, DH’s grandfather passed and at his funeral, DH (25M) was not talkative enough with the guests for her liking, and did not do the speech she had planned for him. She yelled at him the rest of the day post-funeral for not showing how involved he was with his grandfather and making her look bad.

MIL Prime constantly talks about how much she loves DS (1M) and the rest of our family. She talks a good game. We live a 3 hour drive away from her in FL. She has been to see us 3 times since DS was born. We have been to see her countless times as demanded. Each time she visited us it was for a few hours at most, whereas when we visit it is the entire weekend.

SIL lives across the country in CA, a 10 hour plane ride, and MIL goes to visit her and her other grandson (also 1M, he is 6 months older than my son) constantly and stays for weeks at a time.

Around the time of the funeral, which DS was not allowed to attend as he was sick, I confronted DH with how hurt I was that his family never bothers to visit us. He talked to his family and swore it would not be an issue anymore. This was in June and nothing has changed.

Recently, SIL bought a house in NC. MIL Prime and grandmother went to “house sit” the new, empty house. This is what they told DH. All of a sudden, we see videos and pictures of MIL Prime and grandmother with SIL and her son. It’s been almost 2 weeks of them there. Grandmother lives in the same town as MIL Prime, so when we visit her, we also visit grandmother. Grandmother has never come to visit us.

DH and I are not rich by any means. We live in a rented apartment and are often paycheck to paycheck. SIL on the other hand has married a very rich man, has 3 houses, several cars, and has her mother’s attitude of looking down her noses at us for working for other people instead of owning our own businesses (never mind the fact that her own business is funded by her husband).

I am perhaps insecure, but I feel like DH’s family doesn’t care for us as much because we don’t have as much to offer them. Often I get the feeling that they look down at us for being unmarried and not making “enough” money. They also treat DS as though he is not as important as his cousin. DH feels like I am being overly demanding and making mountains out of molehills. Basically I’m just looking for an outside view. Thoughts are greatly appreciated.

PS. Other MIL is certifiable and I will do a second post for her."
914,"I (27f) am 7 months pregnant with a son. The father, my ex, does not want to be involved. His parents do want to be involved, and I've talked to them and worked out a way for my son to be in touch with the grandparents but not the father.

The paternal grandparents live in another country, one that borders the one I live in, and they are about a 14 hour drive. The plan is pretty much that I will help them organise a visit every other month for as long as the kid lives with me, and phone/video calls on the months they don't visit. The first year of visits is already scheduled. They agreed to all of this, and actually suggested most of it. I did no haggling whatsoever to reduce the amount of time, and I suggested the phone/video calls.

They asked me about names, and I told them:

""I have a name picked out, one that I really love and want to give my son, which is Aiden. My family also have a long line of men named Matthew. I was thinking of making Aiden the first name and Matthew the middle name."" (IDR the exact phrasing but pretty sure that was it)

They replied that they were hoping they would get a say, or at least some suggestions, and said they didn't like my name choice. I said I was willing to hear their suggestions. They replied ""Charles or David.""

I said I wasn't a fan of either as a first name but I was open to Aiden Charles or Aiden David. They said it had to be first **and** middle name. So the names they were actually suggesting were ""Charles David"" or ""David Charles"". They said the order was up to me.

I said ""I feel like I'm being steamrolled a bit here. I am the mother of this baby, so it's my call. I am trying to be flexible, and I was willing to hear suggestions, but I'm not going with a completely different set of names. I'll consider using one of your suggestions as a middle name but at the end of the day I get final say, and I like what I picked out.""

They responded that I was being unreasonable. They say that both David and Charles are family names that they want to pass on, and that they need to be together, not just one or the other, and that if I go on to have other kids then I can name them whatever I want, but my currently unborn son will be their only grandchild and said grandchild already won't have their surname. They also say that they will not have a large role in the child's life due to their son's actions, and this will make their role seem ""less like an afterthought"" (their words)

I said my choice would not be based on what makes them feel better, and repeated that as the mother I get the final say.

They seem really upset and when I talked to a friend about it, assuming she'd be on my side, she said ""IDK, the baby will be with you and see your parents all the time, it wouldn't kill you to throw them a bone"" and then went on to say ""you agreed to about 18 years of visits, might be better to start it off on a good note"".

I thought that that was the best response in that situation, as I'm cautious about setting a precedent going forward. I'm worried that if they get their way in this, then they will try and overrule me with other big decisions in future.

Am I the JustNo? I felt I was being reasonable but now I'm beginning to doubt myself.

Edit: just to add - my ex (the father) is named Charlie and the dad (grandfather) is called Dave. They've already used both names.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in England, they're in Wales. There are no grandparent's rights where we are. The extent of the visitation discussion so far is us verbally agreeing to one weekend every other month and then saying they'd look at their calendar, there is no formal agreement, written or otherwise. They are not contributing financially. I'm pretty sure the closest Charlie can come to signing away his paternal rights is if I wither leave him off the birth certificate, which they can get him put back on through a very short and straightforward legal process, or if I get married and my spouse adopts Aiden, but even then Charlie will still be on the birth certificate."
915,"I don't even know where to start with this. I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 years and we recently moved in together, and we're both living with our parents before until he had to move in with mine for his own safety. His mom is completely nuts. There are literally hundreds of stories I could tell about her. She basically is a crazy ball of anger that puts on a facade, and every so often, she just snaps and let's it out in full force. When she snaps she screams at the top of her lungs insulting whoever is around her. These outbursts have happened countless times and are usually directed at my boyfriend. They use things to hold over him (when he lived at home they would use that as leverage to manipulate him, etc). The thing that made me draw that line was around 2.5 years ago when she started (or I witnessed for the first time) getting physical with it. She quite literally lunged and began attacking my boyfriend with whatever force she could manage. Her husband is scared of her and just stands there watching. After that my boyfriend stayed at my house for a while. All of this is accompanied by verbal abuse, blackmail, manipulation in any way she can manage. For example these episodes usually start with a ridiculous request, to which my boyfriend cannot fulfill, and then when he cant do it it's ""if you don't do it then *\_\_\_\_*"". If he still says no she blows up screaming, insulting, and ""kicking him out"", ""banned from the family"", etc. And the next step to this is a week later them pretending nothing happened. Not acknowledging anything at all. In fact they will usually be like 'how come I'm not seeing you much?"".....they pretend everything is normal. Eventually my boyfriend caves and just acts like it all is because it's easier than the drama. Things continued for around a year and a half with these outbursts about once a month. Until she had another much more serious one about 6 months ago. It ended with me calling the police. We didn't see them for quite a few months after that (but they pretended it was normal, telling us to come to a BBQ at their house literally a week later..). We eventually had to see them at a wedding about 2 months ago. They acted normal but I only exchanged a couple words with them. My boyfriend casually talked to them a few more times after that. A month ago, we bought a condo and moved out of my parents place. Leading up to that move, his parents attempted to make the move seem like they were kicking him out (but he didn't even live with them). They also own a small store, and left on vacation, telling my boyfriend to take off work (he works 50 hrs a week at one job, then does around 15 hrs a week freelance) AND to postpone our move so that he could run their shop for them. They booked their vacation 6 months ago and had plenty of employees - my boyfriend doesn't even know how to ""run"" the store. Needless to say he said no. They ""kicked him out"" and said they would tell the whole family not to speak to him. My boyfriend tries to explain that things aren't ok between them - that that night 6 months ago was very troubling and despite him trying to talk to them about it many times they refused. They say never to speak to them again. Shortly after, I receive a text. A very half-assed ""apology"" from him mom for ""accidentally hitting \[me\] on the way to hit \[my boyfriend\]"". I very politely told her she didn't understand the situation, but that I hoped when we moved to our condo and settled in that they can reconsile and that we would like to have them over for supper. Her next text was literally just an insult, saying there was nothing between her and her son, that everything was only wrong we MY relationship with him and that my ""grudge personality"" is the problem here. Again I replied politely saying there was no grudge, we just don't want drama and don't agree with how she treats us. She said ""you still didn't accept my apology. You want me to apologize again?"" &amp; Various insults. I reply a final time politely basically saying what I said before. That was where I left off. They have been acting normal to my BF again. Now my boyfriend's sister is texting him too, saying why are you making it a big deal, just pretend nothing happened and say it's water under the bridge....and I'm worried my boyfriend is going to just move on and pretend like it's normal again. I don't know what to do. I can't tell him to choose between me or his family. I've talked to my parents about it (obviously because my bf lived with them they knew things were wrong) but I didn't tell them about the texts and stuff. Even with only knowing part of the story they never want me to be alone with them. When they heard about the 2 physical incidents they never wanted me to see his parents again and encourage my boyfriend to seek therapy with them. He tried, they refused. Now the thing is his mom is asking to come see our condo. I'm genuinely scared to let her into our home. My parents know I'm reluctant but think they think we should have them over to see it (for my bf's sake, but with people around), but they don't know the extent of everything. What do I do?"
916,"I am trying to do a social media cleanse. I deleted everything, including reddit. But I’m back (with a throwaway account), because MIL is driving me up a wall and I have seemingly nowhere else to turn.

MIL *firmly* believes I blocked her. She is telling family and friends that I’ve blocked her. People are asking my boyfriend why I have blocked her and saying it really hurts her feelings. My boyfriend has explained to *her* that I deleted my it. My boyfriend keeps having to explain *to other people* that I deleted it.

MIL is also convinced that I’m isolating her precious baby from her. Her 21 year old son. Part of the reason I deleted it all was because of the post from MIL. *No one knows what’s it’s like to not have a relationship with your kids, no one knows how hard it is when they slam that door, oh, woe is me.* SO never slammed any doors! She just continues to try to have her nose in OUR business. “What’s in that IRS envelope? How much are your bills?” Questions such as that. If MIL wants to help that’s fine, just don’t be nose-y. That’s all I ask. Not to mention when we try to go and hang out with her, she’s either complaining that SO and I are never telling her anything or that she’s only behaving the way she is because she has no relationship with her son.

I have been dealing with childhood trauma and trying to navigate my way around adulthood without my parents. MIL and FIL were blowing up my phone while I was having a straight mental breakdown. Asking me to go out, to do this, do that. They are always doing it, always asking 20 questions. SO’s friends have even been like, “Why are your parents interrogating me?” It’s kind of embarrassing for him. Anyway, I *politely* declined and asked my boyfriend to tell them to please give me my space. That was a big no according to MIL, she completely shut down. She gave everyone the silent treatment for probably 3 weeks. If there’s even a hint of criticism in the air around MIL, the world is over. 

Background: MILs mother got into a pretty bad relationship one time. MIL and SO had to help her pack up her stuff in the middle of the night to get her away from this man. He cut off the phone, no internet, and she wasn’t allowed to have ANY contact with family. This mans “name” was Mark. MIL passive aggressively called SO “Mark.”

I also stopped having as much contact with MIL because for some reason, she chose me as her personal therapist. MIL was instigating tons of issues with my boyfriends ex and BM. So much that it wrecked my relationship. Every time I walked into a room there was a discussion about BM, what she was doing, how she blocked MIL on social media. BM and MIL both are very dramatic, so it was a constant war between them. I never involved myself in the drama, just tried to listen. But after hearing about it for hours on end for days at a time, it got to be too much.

SO and I are moving out really short notice. We should be moving out two weeks before Christmas. SO hasn’t told MIL yet because, understandably, he doesn’t want to deal with the out-lash. He knows we have to tell her soon.

Anyway, rant over. I’m going to burn my pumpkin scented candle, take some deep breaths and drink some tea. Thanks for listening, and if you have any kind advice, it’s welcomed.

This just in: MIL is upset SO and I are fleeting social media because “it makes her feel connected” *uuuuuugggggggggghhhhh*"
917,"Earlier I had posted about my FJNMIL who convinced my boyfriend to break up with. I’ve since deleted the post because my SO was getting so much crap and that’s not what I intended. We have been back together for 3 months and he has yet to tell his family. I keep asking him to casually mention we’re hanging out and I feel the more he talks about it the more comfortable things could go in the long run. 
Well last night he finally told me the whole story. I knew he hadn’t completely told me the truth but here it is....
My FMIL convinced my boyfriends family that I was abusing prescription drugs. Now I’ve learned that she threatened him if he did not break things off with me that she would build a case against me and the doctor I work for. Her boyfriend is a very “high power” attorney and SO felt breaking things off would keep me safe. 
Let me clearly state that I have done nothing wrong. Yes, the provider I work for doesn’t have a spine and hands out narcotics like candy. I do have a big concern with it, ethically, but my supervisor has specifically told me to not get involved and to not go against a doctors orders. 
SO dropped a bomb on me last night. 
He is afraid that if he tells his family, his mother will use her boyfriends legal leverage and is willing to fabricate and twist things into looking like I am helping him sell drugs. This is huge. Obviously she’s a monster and I am NC while he was LC. 
Last night we were talking and we’ve decided to go to the courthouse to marry. 
Not only do we know we’re staying together and would love to get married, this is the plan we’ve had. I never wanted anything big. If we marry, she would specifically be going after her own son and he wouldn’t be able to testify against me. We do want to get married and are going to just go to the courthouse to get it done quickly. Let me be very clear- I have done nothing wrong. 
SO says they are willing to target me and even fabricate things if they have to. 
He’s afraid they will get some one to approve  a search warrant and come in to my home. 
I explained to him they need to go before a judge to get a search warrant but he says lawyer boyfriend could easily obtain this cause he’s such “a hot shot” with friends in high places. 
I have nothing to hide but he is afraid they would plant evidence against me. 
I’ve reached out to my friend who is a defense attorney since I know nothing about this stuff and neither does SO. I believe they are just trying to scare him but his mother is nuts. 
Basically we’re having a low key courtroom wedding and telling no one. We are ready for it and it isn’t the circumstance we were hoping for but we’re in it for the long haul and feel like it would help the situation. We truly want to marry. I have no idea what kind of pull this boyfriend-lawyer has but it scares us both.

Update: thank you everyone! I assumed he would have no rights even with his “authority”. My SO has been NC for about 2 weeks since his grandmothers funeral and will remain that way. I am meeting with my lawyer-friend tonight and we will be looking into small cameras for the home. We live in a controlled access building so it’s not like they can somehow find their way in.

Update: Talked to lawyer-friend. She says there’s nothing to worry about because I haven’t done anything wrong. 
To everyone who says I need to quit and run, I am only doing my job and don’t have anything to do with the meds. What I do is write when they were last seen, when their last refill was and the quantity they got. For all medications- controlled or not. He takes it from there.

Update: I posted an update yesterday but mods deleted since it was about SO. I just posted it to r/justnoso 
SO broke NC to help his mom buy a car yesterday... it was like a month of NC and he didn’t even tell her. He wanted to “avoid the drama”. I get that his sisters wedding is coming up and he didn’t want to start a bunch of stuff and get her all worked up since she’s got so much else going on. That’s why I haven’t pressed the issue of him telling them we’re back together. Once the wedding is over, we were going to come forward. But going to help her? Noooope."
918,"FMIL surprised everyone this weekend by booking us for a 7 day cruise in 2021. She did this all without discussing it with anyone else. She picked the dates and duration on her own. Am I the asshole for being pissed off about this? 

I don’t want to take a 7 day cruise. It’s not my idea of a fun vacation. The time of year is not great for me work-wise. Also, I think it’s very disrespectful to not even discuss this beforehand with us as we are adults with our own lives. I’m 34 and my fiancée is 28. We have busy jobs and rarely take an entire week off for our own vacations. While the cruise is surely an expensive gift, I can afford my own vacations and would rather just pay for what I want to do. 

So now I’m in a difficult position of voicing my concerns and looking like a ungrateful jerk or just dealing with it spending a week doing something I don’t want to do."
919,"JNMom and JNDad are out for several weeks. Sure they left reminders plastered all over a house occupied entirely by adults, but I just shrug. 

They have been gone 2 days. I am mostly in charge at home. It is peaceful."
920,"To keep things sort of short for now, JMIL has planned a bday dinner tonight for Bf and I (thanks to this community) decided **not** to go. Honestly, it was a really rough decision on my end as I was afraid of hurting bf’s feelings, but I’ll mark it off as a success, one of my first actually. 

I planned for our old high school group to go out tomorrow for bfs actual bday so we can celebrate without JMIL (big thank you to those who recommended I go this route :) it’s helped my relationship as well as allowing me to stand up for myself). 

JMIL tried texting me today asking if I was going I said no. She immediately asked me what bf wanted for his bday I said a tattoo (she doesn’t want him to get a tattoo but he’s wanted one for years). She never responded after that and I’ve muted her contact. I’m ready for the quiet now at least until the holidays 🙌🏻 

*Side Note: last night I had to go to the immediate care center ($77) because I had a cut in my eye from the concert due to all of the dust, I must’ve rubbed my eye, causing the cut. Anyway, it sounds dumb but part of me blames her for my eye issue right now as well.*

I’ll keep the updates coming as holidays come closer. Thank you all so much, this community has been the best thing that’s happened to me this past month!"
921,"Hello helpful humans!
This community has been such a support for me and has, truly, given such wonderful advice.
I didn’t take it. Please read my previous posts for the back story. DH sent JNMIL an email in response to hers. Y’all had me convinced that a response was not a good option BUT it was very therapeutic for DH. The email was from both of us but, honestly, DH started to type and all of his repressed emotions spilled out. 

Right or wrong it’s done. And we’re yet to hear anything. From JNMIL at least! The FM are out in force! We know that JNMIL has played the victim to everyone and GMIL’s birthday is this month. We won’t be going to her birthday dinner but have asked to take her out for lunch. I don’t know how this is gonna go.. Of course we know that JNMIL has spoken to her mother, we know that she has been feeding GMIL her side of the story since before my birthday blow up. What we don’t know is how to handle any questions or comments. This is gonna be so difficult for DH if things don’t go well! Help!"
922,"Hello, 

This is my first post on here after reading many. I suspect I have a Narcissist Mil and am desperately seeking advice. My partner and I aren’t actually married but we do have a 1 year old son together.
 I remember the first time I met her almost 4 years ago now, I thought what a wonderful lady. She made me feel very welcome, she was warm and friendly. A friend asked me the following week “how was she, she’s scary isn’t she” I was confused and responded not at all she was lovely.... how naive was I! 
It wasn’t long before every time we would visit and that was every 1-2 weeks that she started really questioning me on my job. I would get asked, so what do you want to do as a career, where is your job going, do they pay you enough, they need to send you on a course, then would refer to someone she knew who’s son or daughter had a high flying job and earned lots of money. I started questioning my job and thinking what I was doing obviously wasn’t good enough. 
Baring in Mind that my partners family are wealthy, they live in a big house and she’s not very modest about that.  So this continued for months, I started dreading going over as I knew I would get asked the same questions. Never was I asked, how are you? How was your week it was always the same things. Eventually she convinced me I had to re write my cv and that while my partner was working out of town she would come over and help e re write it. I was feeling a little uncomfortable and decided a few days before that I didn’t want her to do this. I had messaged her thanking her but explaining I was going through some personal things and I was feeling a little stressed that perhaps another time. Well this did not go down well. She kept calling and leaving voicemails, she then called my partner saying somethings wrong with me. That weekend we then were made to go over to their house while she sat me down and said she was worried for her sons safety and that I had upset her.. she was so furious with me and I wasn’t sure what I had done wrong. From that moment on things never improved, when ever I saw her she would either ignore me, not engage with anything I said when we were all together I was very much dismissed. Some days she would seem to be ok and occasionally I would think oh she likes me again. I would go out of my way to please her, I bought her flowers to say sorry even though I wasn’t sure what I was sorry for. I started to not talk as much or voice my opinion I would just sit there and listen. I could sense something wasn’t ok but I thought perhaps I wasn’t good enough, maybe I needed a new job, to dress differently. I made sure I covered up my tattoos when I was seeing them and agreed when anything was said. 
My partner and I had booked a trip to Paris for my birthday, shortly after him and his family decided they wanted to breed their dog. They had agreed that the puppies would be born at their house as they’ve got the space and my partner would go over and help out. When our Paris trip arrived the puppies were about 6 weeks old, they’d known about the trip and it had never been an issue but apparently now it was. She was furious that we were going away, only for 2 nights. We had gone over to their house before the trip and she started screaming at me, demanded that I made my partner go over to their house more and that it was my responsibility to make him do so. I was in such shock I couldn’t understand why this lady hated me so much to warrant this type of behaviour. Again I said I was sorry and that I can’t control what her son does or doesn’t do. We left fairly sharpish and after our return from Paris had visited to yet again a cold reception. No asking if I had a nice birthday, no questions about Paris. A place I had wanted to go for years that had been booked for months. I thought maybe we shouldn’t have gone, even though they wanted the puppies at theirs and were all for them maybe I should have cancelled my trip and My partner could have gone over even though there had been times she would say “don’t worry about coming over we’ve got it “ I just couldn’t understand what was happening.  

Before the first falling out they had asked me if I would like to go  on holiday with them, I remember my partner  saying “you really don’t have too” and wondering why does he seem hesitant. It sounded like a wonderful idea and they quickly booked it for us all and refused to let me pay despite trying too. So a few months passed after the puppy incident and the holiday was here. I was so nervous about going, luckily I had started a course and I had to fly back early for that so only had 4 nights there. That was more then enough, now I am extremely grateful for the holiday the place was incredible and her face would light up when I told her how amazing it was. I continued to try and please her and make conversation but my input wasn’t heard. I spent most of the time quiet around the table. Questioning why was I there? She would talk about how much money people had or talk about people’s short comings and laugh about them.  I was relieved when I got on that plane home. 

Things got a little better for a while some times we saw her she would be charming and I would be trying to please still and other times she would look at me in this way and I would just feel sick to the stomach. This continued for months, I then fell pregnant .... a moment that should be filled with joy was spent worrying about how would she react. We didn’t tell them for 2 weeks and my partner went alone to give them the news. I know she cried and he’s not said much more then that. I assumed it wasn’t too bad so when we drove over there the following weekend for me to see them I didn’t expect what happened. 
The moment I walked in I got that look, if a look could kill I would have been dead. I knew it wasn’t going to go well, she wouldn’t even come near me. Her voice was angry, passive aggressive, I said hello, how are you? 
She glared and said how do you think I am? She then said you have to give me time, this is not what we had planned for “sons” life. 
 I was shaking by this point I didn’t know what to do or what to say I felt so trapped. I remember crying and saying how can I bring a baby into this family when it’s like this. A comment she has used on me time and time again as apparently I offended and upset her by saying that as in her words she had a very loving family. 
We eventually left and I was so worn down I didn’t know what to do, I spent a week in bed sick with morning sickness and also wondering what can I do.  Her husband had suggested she came over to our house and we talked things through, so she did just that. She turned up, started crying telling me how she’s loosing sleep, how she’s had enough troubles with her son and that she can’t be made to feel like this, I said sorry again stupidly and ignored how she had been to me. I just thought if I agreed then things would be better. I limited contact and the times we did see her she would look at my growing belly as if I had a parasite. I remember being at a family event and she turned around and said. “I hope you have a girl as I hate the name you’ve chosen for a boy”  I just sat there feeling numb. 

We had made a choice that we didn’t want anyone at the hospital after I give birth, mainly i didn’t want her there after how she had been. Everyone knew our wishes, the day came or should I say days. I was in labour for 43 hours, exhausted, hormonal and then my partner got a text from his dad saying his sister and mum wanted to come to the hospital. When my partner said no we’ve already told you he called him a selfish prick and that it wasn’t fair on his mum or sister. I felt so bad I ended up agreeing that his sister could come as she was due to go back to uni and wouldn’t be back for a month but his parents could meet him when we were out- the next day. 
And that they did, they came round. She had that look again, as she held him she didn’t smile once she said “ well it’s done now” 
Words can’t explain how we both were feeling by this point. 
My partner went back to work after 2 weeks and I remember she asked me to go to her house so my son could meet her friend. She picked me up, drove me there. Spent the afternoon any time he cried she said you need to feed him, you need t change him. I just went and did everything she said even sometimes just sat in the other room and cuddled him so I didn’t have to be in the room with her. 

Things got worse again by the time my son started on solids, she would comment that he doesn’t need me as much and that my milk wasn’t enough for him. She tried to feed him roast beef at 6 months old and when I said no she just kept saying how her friends kid was eating ribs at 6 months and laughing. Any opportunity she got she was saying what he should or shouldn’t be eating. At one point during this dinner he chocked on something she gave him. We left after that I couldn’t sit there any longer. My partner the next day spoke with his dad and said that we respect advice but that she needs to rein it in a little, this didn’t go down well. Apparently when her husband told her this she went hysterical so much so he thought he would need to take her to the hospital.  
Again like before we had to meet up with them, they said they wanted to come to ours but I refused. I said we could meet at the common near our house- mutual ground. She turned up with glasses on, she was crying. Saying this is to much for her, that she’s not done anything wrong. Even her husband this time said I was overreacting. Like always our feelings and request was ignored and we left feeling like things had been swept under the carpet. 

She got better for a while and then again as always the comments would be made, I had started to try and ignore them. Smile and nod. I thought we were getting on ok, and then my sons 1st birthday came around. She was late to the party and when I tried to hug her and ask he she was she walked past shaking her head and spoke with other family members that were there. Then she started to have a nose bleed and there was a big scene. The only time she spoke to me for that whole party was to come up to me and say” you need to give Your son some water” I had just fed him breast milk I knew he was ok so I said I’ll go take him now and she said no I’ll just do it and walked off. 
He then was getting tired from all his playing so I put him in his pram to have a rest and nap if he would, she walked up to me and said “you’re putting him to bed on his birthday, aren’t you doing his cake” I said well he’s been up for a long time he’s having a rest she walked off. 
Guests had started Leaving and I was talking with some friends, she comes up to me and said. You need to make sure people are taking cakes, I said people will take them if they want too. Again she turned around and walked off. 
A day that should be enjoyable I just felt deflated. The next day was his actual birthday and I had said they could see him that we would pop over, well I was too angry to see her so my partner was going to pop over with him without me. They called and said no we are coming to you, he said no I’ll be at yours. Even they text and he said that he was going to theirs.. they didn’t listen and they turned up at our house. This ended in an argument and her crying again. 

During this whole time our house has been renovated to sell, my partner and his brother bought it as an investment. He lives with his girlfriend so we’ve been living in it through out the whole process. We went away the day after his birthday for a week and his brother decided that he wanted the estate agents t come and take photos for it to go on the market. Now the house was left tidy before we went, maybe not photo ready but we didn’t know that was happening. So we come back from holiday and everything in our house has been moved. They’ve even gone into my underwear draw and moved things around, into my vanity cupboard and moved things around. Those things did not need to be touched for photographs. While it’s appreciated they tidied other things y personal belongings didn’t need to be. We decided though to let it go and just try and ignore it, the house would be sold soon and we could go separate ways. The next day his brother then posted message in the family WhatsApp saying the house was on the market and well done everyone  for their help. 
His mum then sent a long text, congratulating the boys, their dad, her daughter and his brothers girlfriend, not one mention of me. Nothing. 
I thought that’s it now, I exited the group and haven’t had any contact since. 
My partner has said to them this is enough now. 
 
There’s also a lot more things like his brother and gfriend have only been together year and half, they’ve already all gone out with the parents for dinners and stuff. They only met my mum once before our sons party and she refused to talk to my mum. 
His brothers girlfriends parents are wealthy and also own horses not that it should matter but to his mum it seems too. She’s always so lovely to her and when the three of us have been in a room together I get ignored while she just asks her loads of questions and anything I say is quickly moved on from.

So after all of this I have decided I no longer want to see her, I have said I’ve made a choice to go no contact. His dad said I am wrong and that it’s in my head. Please advise me and tell me I’m not wrong? That I have made the right choice. I’ve been so depressed through this all I had to see a therapist who by the way said she was a narcissist so that’s why I’m posting on here. Please help me x"
923,"TW: controlling behaviour

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 28 year old lesbian. I came out at 16, so mum has been aware of the lesbian part for a little under half my life. I had dinner with her yesterday to introduce her and my brother to my girlfriend of a year.

Our waiter was a boy who was clearly in his late teens. I'd say 20 at absolute oldest, but realistically this boy was 16-19 years old. When he poured us all water, he took maybe a couple of seconds longer to pour mine than he did others, and when he came to check on us he usually ended up stood near me or looking at me, as we were in a booth and I was on the outside and therefore closest to him.

Mum took this as her cue to tell this teenage boy, in front of my girlfriend, that my 28 year old lesbian self was ""available"". The waiter looked really uncomfortable and I just held my girlfriend's hand tighter while saying that I am not ""available"", not because I thought the waiter would actually use the information, but more to remind my mum.

The first waiter probably asked to switch with someone as we didn't see him again after that and another guy, at least closer to me in age, took over our table. Mum then tried the exact same thing with him, and when I again reminded her that I am not ""available"" she told me that ""you should keep your options open""

Towards the end of the meal I excused myself for the bathroom and my girlfriend came with me. We should not have left mum at the table. We came back, mum asked if we were good to go, and we all left. My brother grabbed my hand and pulled me into a hug, and as he did that he, secret agent style, slipped the receipt into my hand. When we got into the car I looked at the receipt and mum had written ""call me xxx"" along with MY NUMBER, clearly intending on leaving it behind for any male waiter who would take it.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 14, and mum is on the controlling side. I never got a lot of it, but my brother is ""her baby"", so he's not allowed a phone or a bank account and she's said he's not allowed to get a job until he finishes his education, which includes if he goes to university. If he does go to university, he'll be expected to live with mum and commute, even though the closest university is an hour and 2 trains away.

I need to stay in touch with my brother. I can't leave him with her. Dad ducked out after I moved out, so it's just mum and my brother in the family home. Mum is my only method of communication with my brother. I tried giving him a small, basic, pay as you go phone meant mainly for texting, but mum found it. He has a laptop but she goes through his browser history and put in some sort of child lock which stops him from going on certain sites, even in incognito mode. He has a facebook account he can access at school or the library, but school is 8-3 weekdays and the library is 8-6 Monday-Saturday, so there's a lot of hours where he has no way to contact me.

&amp;#x200B;

If this were just about me I'd have cut contact with mum yonks ago, but I have to consider my brother, too. My girlfriend says that she supports whatever I want to do in regards to the whole situation, and he's welcome in the spare room any time. Mum disrespected me, my girlfriend, our relationship, my sexuality and nearly got me put on the register all in the span of a couple hours. I can't just let it slide, but I can't go full no contact, or even low contact, as the only time I get to see my brother is at these dinners, which are once every two weeks.

What do I do?"
924,"**TL;DR My SO has totally succumbed to N-Mom’s abusive tactics and guilt-tripping, moved out of our shared home, and is now unemployed and living in their childhood bedroom at MIL’s home to be brainwashed full-time. Lots of WTF and where do we go from here??**

We aren’t actually married, but my [27F] live-in partner of 2 years [26NB] has just moved out of our apartment and back to their hometown on a massive guilt trip from their narcissistic mom.

Let’s call my partner SO, and their mother Fakey McCancer.

To be fair, Fakey McCancer isn’t in perfect health, she has had COPD for years. She’s also refused to quit smoking or do anything prescribed by her doctor to help. For example, she’s supposed to use an inhaler, but would rather SO worry and nag her about it for years than actually do anything for her health. She’s far from frail or sickly, however. She’s 60, strong as hell, and constantly moving. She’s fucking fine.

Fakey McCancer had one very nasty divorce and one very lucrative tech career. She retired at 40 because she was rich and depressed. She now flips furniture and micromanages SO’s life for fun. She has a habit of making plans for SO’s life, and absolutely flipping her shit when nobody follows her plan.

SO went mostly-NC with her a couple years ago for this reason, and things have been great I’m her absence. Recently she wormed her way in by playing nice and claiming she was finally quitting smoking because she was getting worried for her health. Contact seemed minimal and their phone calls were mostly her telling funny stories about goings-on in SO’s hometown. It seemed harmless. Until she started visiting.

Fakey McCancer claims to like me, but she also had a full-on panic attack when she saw my clothes in SO’s closet (before we moved in to my apartment together).

SO is relatively ambivalent about her more dramatic behaviors, and calls her out frequently for being a narcissist and a gas-lighter. However, SO is still tremendously susceptible to her guilt-trips, and readily admits as much. I’ve seen SO both call out her abuse, as well as suddenly become a panicked, obedient child in the face of her demands. It’s really difficult to watch my shrewd, emotionally-competent partner be completely leveled by this woman.

SO’s research contract with a local university ended recently, and SO has been searching for work/attempting to change career fields. I knew it might take time for SO to find work in their desired field, and was absolutely willing and prepared to support the both of us financially, without so much as a second thought! SO is a fantastic partner, and is the most intelligent, capable, and kind-hearted person I’ve ever met. Of course I want to share everything and more with them! And of course I expressed as much. And this was our plan, as we want to spend our lives together.

Fakey McCancer, however, has other plans. She has been in SO’s ear for months, telling them that me financially supporting us would ruin the relationship forever, and that SO would be terrible and selfish and absolutely shameful to “take advantage” of me financially in that way. *Move in with Mom*, she said, *you’ll save money, and find a job faster, because if you stay with OP you’ll get nothing done!* Bitch, what?

SO wasn’t totally convinced, but I could tell they were having doubts as the end of their contract neared, and with no job prospects to speak of. Ultimately, we continued living together (although Fakey McCancer definitely expected them to drive to her city immediately upon their final day of work, despite SO insisting this wouldn’t happen).

Finally, about a month later, Fakey McCancer asked them to come home and help her with something one weekend. I didn’t think much of it. During that visit, I called to chat and SO sounded very weird. They started telling me they needed to move home ASAP that very week, because their mom was under the impression (HER OWN) that SO would be moving home with all their stuff when they came down to visit, and she was very upset that wasn’t the case.

Uhhhhh, what the fuck?!

I was literally dumbfounded. I reminded SO that my birthday was the following week and we had plans. That seemed to snap them out of it momentarily, and they texted me that Fakey McCancer was eavesdropping on the phone call and we’d talk later.

When SO got home, they apologized for the weird phone call and springing that on me, but informed me that their mom was probably going to die soon and they needed to move home and help her. They sounded panicked as they said explained that they could still leave before my birthday, and just drive back up a few days later to celebrate with me over the weekend. They could alternate living a week at their moms (~5 hours away) and a week at my place.

Do you hear how completely insane that sounds????

During that visit, Fakey McCancer had been dramatically preparing her will, and had made SO sign a bunch of estate-planning documents. She had made SO take her to the doctor, as she was suddenly “dreadfully ill” (according to her intuition) and suddenly realized her kids were right and she needed the inhaler all along. She told SO she *needs someone there to tell her when to stop working every day or she is going to die.* Somehow, she frames this as being merely a temporary inconvenience that would inexplicably save her life, or make her final days more peaceful, or otherwise somehow absolve SO of not paying enough attention to the dying woman who birthed them. I can’t believe this shit.

TWO days after my birthday, SO moved out.

It’s been really shitty. Fakey McCancer has not “slowed down” her furniture flipping hustle like she claimed she needed to, for her health. In fact, every time I call, she has SO hauling furniture and unloading trucks with her, etc. She eavesdrops on our calls constantly, and gloats into the phone *”Sorry I’ve been keeping SO too busy to talk to you! Love you sweetie!”* because she knows we’ve been arguing about this. She’s still fucking chain-smoking. She doesn’t use the inhaler she made such a fuss about.

We don’t usually fight, but this will be my hill to die on. SO is telling me they are getting depressed there. They are constantly too busy or tired from Fakey McCancer’s “assignments” to apply for many jobs (shocker) or do anything but sleep. Fakey McCancer is trying to convince SO to find a ~more lucrative~ job in her (higher cost of living) city, rather than move back here. SO wants to come home, but is completely distraught that their mother is dying after they’ve “spent so many years dodging her calls.” She’s feeding SO bullshit that I’ll resent them and break us up for financially supporting us.

I’m so mad at both of them, but I also feel so upset and powerless, because SO is so brainwashed by this woman. Luckily, SO has a second interview coming up with a company in my city, but of course Fakey McCancer is already freaking out because the benefits supposedly aren’t good enough.

How the fuck did this happen to my otherwise perfect relationship?!??????"
925,"First I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who commented and offered support on my last post I couldn’t have ever imagined that so many people would see it and offer so many kind words. Since my husbands passing I’ve felt really alone and especially horrible because of my egg donor and I’m eternally grateful to you all.  

If you don’t feel like readying my last post a brief synopsis of it would be that my husband passed away when I was 21 and my mother chose to go on vacation one day after he died. 

This is an old story now so I don’t know that I need advice but it’s been really cathartic to tell others my story with my mom so here is a story that took place about three months after my husband died. 
     After my husband passed I moved away to a different state for a few months to live with my father and to take my young son somewhere that didn’t constantly remind us of the life we once had. I eventually decided to come back home to be near my friends and family. I only went to our old house three times after he died all three immediately after to grab some clothes for my son and myself and just a couple personal belongings we couldn’t be without. Entering my home was gut wrenching and physically painful so I really avoided it but when I came back I had to find a new home for us and I had to clean the old place out. 
      My best friend managed to go in and box up some and clean out a little but I had to do the brunt of it. I went and tried to do as much as I could in about three full days, going through everything and dividing it up and making hard choices no one in my family offered their support or help my mom even said I was a baby for asking for help when I said it was too hard to do alone. After I finished getting all that I needed out and cried my heart out I planned on coming back in a week to deep clean everything for the landlord. At the time my JNstep grandma had been slightly offering her support and making it seem like she genuinely cared and I was grateful beyond belief. My 80% JYMil works for a cleaning company and when I mentioned to her my plans to return and deep clean the house and asked if she could watch my son while I go over she insisted that she would go in and do it for me that she would take all her professional stuff with her and shed take care of everything for me and that is exactly what she did, she spent a whole day doing this and I know it was probably hard for her to also be there but she didn’t complain not even one time about it. 
  
I know I’m bouncing around a lot so if you’re still with me thank you and I promise I’m getting to the point soon. 

I was with my JNmom one day not too long after this and she had asked me to get her phone and see who had texted her. When I went to her messages I noticed my name in the preview texts with my JNSgrandma so I clicked to see more which I recognize that, that was a breech of privacy but I couldn’t stop myself. What I had read made me physically sick. They had been texting about how I am selfish and useless because I forced my JYMil to clean the whole house alone and my mother even went as far as saying “it must be nice to have servants” my blood boiled and I couldn’t help but immediately cry. My husband had died only months prior and they had the audacity to break me down and acted like I was such a horrible person for accepting help. The thing about his death is that it was very sudden and very traumatic for me I developed PTSD and was struggling to make it through the days. I was walking zombie and I was taking everything one second at time so it stung so much and it wasn’t just one text there were so many more including ones disrespecting my late husband and saying so many horrible things I took pictures of the texts to even be able to go back and analyze it more closely. I confronted them both separately and they both reacted like I was the crazy one and I was the one in the wrong and even convinced others that I was the problem. I’m NC at this point with them both my step grandma for about two years now but my mother more recently after her not showing up for my son. 


Sorry this is so long if you read this whole thing thank you so much"
926,"Y’all. This woman. This turned into a real novel of a rant so, I’m sorry. I said no advice because the current situation is mostly handled but if you have insight or opinions feel free to give me your two cents. 

FH and I have been together for 5 years. Prior to that we were in high school and dated on and off for 4 years. So we’ve been close for the last 9 years. We are finally engaged and planning our wedding for next fall. We decided in June to start planning and just recently got “officially” engaged. I knew it was coming but it was super sweet and we were happy to finally share the news beyond the few people that knew when we booked our venue (my JustYesMom, my JYsister, and three friends). 

FH had called his JYgrandparents (fathers parents) and told them. I insisted that he had to call his mom ASAP and tell her unless he wanted her to find out via book of faces. He tried for days and couldn’t get in touch. When he finally did and told her, it was like he told her what he had for lunch. No reaction. Didn’t care. We both expected this. I figured she’d either blow up or show no reaction. Now that I’ve posted it on bookface for cousins and such to see, she has not so much as liked the post (and honestly I’m loving it because EVERYONE on her side of the family and FILs family has loved it and are giving us such sweet, well wishes and she’s being bitter in her lonely little corner). 

This woman hates me. I watched FSIL, picked her up from school, drove her to hockey practice, brought FH to work at the job MIL got for him that he didn’t want (because it wasn’t on the bus route and she worked there) that she then refused to drive him to, cleaned her house, cooked for FSIL, and watched their dog. All of once I asked if my dog could stay there for a long weekend while I went to the beach with my mom for my birthday. I never asked anything of her. 

But, I came in and stole her son-husband. FH couldn’t get a full time job, go to college classes, move out or do really anything (never allowed to go anywhere after school in HS) because he had to be home to raise his sister while his mother went to college and worked 60 hours as a waitress (and now that she has a degree? Works 60 hours as a waitress.) But then I came in and saw a 19 year old with no education or real job. I got him a better job where I worked, helped him buy a car, moved five hours away, helped him get a better job and a better car, helped him pay for trade classes, and now we’re planning on getting married and buying a house once I’m done with my masters next fall. She lost her second parent, so I’m the devil. I also refused to bend to her every whim and demand despite also spending all my free time caring for her other kid, and therefore I am, in her exact words, a selfish bitch. 

So, I’m here to rant because during the original phone call, MIL commented that she thought their elderly dog was starting to act a little senile. She’s around 15 and while she’s MILs dog, my FH was always her person. My dog passed away last November and it’s been really hard on me and FH asked if he could bring his dog to our house to get some of (what are looking like) her last days in. We have a cat now but his dog is some sort of chihuahua mix who has no teeth and almost no vision and our cat is scared of everything. I agreed because I figured they’d be fine, our current set up makes it easy to separate them, and we’re planning on getting another dog soon anyway, so getting the cat used to a dog is a good idea. 

MIL takes this news of taking the dog as an opportunity to see FH. We moved back home last winter and are currently about 15 minute drive from MIL. FH still never goes to see her for a multitude of reasons. None of which is because I hate her, but of course she sees it as me keeping him from her. She called and asked if FH wanted to get dinner when he came to pick up dog as we started a 3 hour drive to visit a wedding venue. The venue was somewhere I love that I don’t go often so I had an itinerary set for the day that was open ended, no idea when we’d be home. He told MIL he’d talk to me and see if we’d have time to do so. She immediately snapped and said he didn’t have to get my approval for everything and we aren’t attached and don’t have to do everything together. She “just wants to talk to him! I can’t talk to my son? I want to go just the three of us (meaning SIL)! Or two of us!” I’m a foot away from him in the car and can hear the whole conversation. He snaps back at her that she can talk all she wants but she doesn’t need to try to get in his head or speak to him alone. She starts getting mad and he just hung up on her. I was silent for a moment and then said “you know that’s not a normal reaction right? Like, you’re a grown man and we’ve been dating and living together for years. A normal mother doesn’t want to isolate her son and ‘talk’ after she finds out he’s engaged” and he said “I know it’s weird it’s like she’s...possessive over me.” And I said “well, yeah. Duh. You’re her real husband. I ‘stole’ you.” To which he shouted “YUCK PLEASE STOP”. Thankfully, FH doesn’t let her get away with this weird behavior, especially not anymore. He started to say he should just go over and deal with it to which I said “you can do what you want but I’m telling you that she cannot just speak about me like that and then be rewarded with alone time with you.” He usually takes the route of just appeasing her to shut her up but he actually agreed with me on this one. He hasn’t spoken to her since. The downside is that we still haven’t been over to get the dog, but we can plan to do that when she’s not home. I’m just relieved FH is making his spine shiner with every argument they have. I’m sad for him though, that he has no close family that is happy for him."
927,"Fuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkk. Me and my D(ear)H have known for a while now that his mom has bad baby rabies. But last night she took it to a whole other level!DH called her because he has a weekly call to his parents. No biggie. The call actually started off really nice! We were both chatting (we had his parents on speakerphone) about the weather and stuff going on in their town. It was a good, healthy phone call.

**was** (-\_-)

The topic of Christmas came up and MIL wanted to know where we'd be going. Now, me and DH have decided not to travel. I only get three days off and I'd like to save my vacation time so that I can later visit my older sister (who is having her baby in December).DH let her know about me wanting to visit my sister (I know, I know, we gotta work on grey rocking and info diets) and that's when the baby rabies showed itself in all its crazed, manic glory.To make it simple, I'll bullet point the crazy:

* MIL asked numerous times when we'll have kids (even though she didn't have DH till 36)
* MIL ""joked"" about me *stealing my sisters child to bring to her because my sister doesn't need another one*
* MIL told us ""well, you need to have a kid or I'll be in prison for stealing one! hahahahahahahahaha"", to which I replied, ""well, we'll see you in prison"". 
* MIL started describing the features she wants ~~her~~ our baby to have. (I'm a certain ethnicity and I think she's in love with the idea of a ""mixed baby"" even tho I'm the palest person in my family lol any baby I have with DH will be a pretty white baby).
* MIL kept referring to the (theoretical) baby as hers. Which we did actually call out and she backtracked and said, ""oh obviously I meant my grandbaby"".  

And the particular joke that creeped me the fuck out:

MIL: we'll I'm praying for it. 

DH: you do that. We're not having one yet.

MIL: I have an in with the big guy hahahahaha

Me: No.

MIL: well, it won't be your will but it'll be His will hahahahaha

(super mad at myself for not replying, ""well thank god for abortions"" lol that would've pissed her off so much)

I know both me and DH need to stop responding to her in this way and ultimately need to sit her town and tell her to stop. We were both just, shocked into silence. Who fuckin says things like this???? Who fucking hears their DIL say they don't want a baby right now and just thinks, ""i'll just pray to make this happen against her wishes""??!!! This whole phone call stressed me out so much that I developed a cold sore overnight. She's really given me a glimpse into what she's gonna be like when we have a kid and it makes me so stressed. I think I want us to send a text to her outlining that 1.we don't appreciate the baby comments/pressure, 2.last night was inappropriate/crossed several lines, and 3.that we will not put up with it at thanksgiving. Any help with drafting this text would be helpful. Also, help with ideas for consequences if she boundary stomps again during Thanksgiving. They live in a small town up in the mountains with like, maybe one hotel (that i doubt we could last minute grab a room) so we wouldn't be able to leave her house.

EDIT: spacing

EDIT2/UPDATE: Hi everyone! Thanks so much for all your supportive comments. Me and DH have crafted a message to send to her tomorrow. I'll see about making an update post that'll include our message and MILs response.  I know everyone is very concerned about my birth control, but I want to  reiterate that she has had no access to it as she lives \~8 hours away. When we visit, me and husband will safeguard it."
928,"\[The flair says 'Advice Wanted'. I'd prefer to say Advice Welcome. I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but I'm not opposed to thoughts. Saying I'm ambivalent just feels little crappy.\]

Last week, I posted about my MIL (along with FIL) writing my wife and I a nasty email about the fact that we’re unable to accommodate family for Thanksgiving, because we’re already accommodating family for Thanksgiving.

Here is the link if you’d like to read up on the drama: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dcfiym/were\_accommodating\_my\_family\_for\_thanksgiving\_my/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dcfiym/were_accommodating_my_family_for_thanksgiving_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I’m providing a bit of an update on the situation. When I arrived home the evening that we’d received the email (Wednesday), I told my wife I was going to invite them over on Friday evening so this could be discussed face to face. These we’re accusations that questioned my responsibility as a parent and a homeowner. I take them very seriously and, for now, it has truly altered the relationship that I have with my IL’s. 

The text that I sent was very polite, but generic. The response was a simple “Ok.” Fine by me. I was pissed and had no interest in any sort of back and forth.

By the next afternoon (Thursday), they’d sent a text saying that they really didn’t want to have to come over. Reminiscent of the childhood whine, ""Do I gottaaaaah?!"" They didn’t want anything to be ruined for our weekend (they were going to watch our daughter, while my wife and I celebrated our anniversary) or for the Thanksgiving holiday. They just wanted us to know what they thought about how things are happening right now, because they “care”. 

How about: Go. Fuck. Yourself. 

You call in to question our choice to move our daughter into her new bedroom to make room for her not-yet-born brother in the nursery and because that impacts the availability of rooms in our house for the accommodation of others (something we’re not obligated to do) that makes us “selfish, helicopter parents”. Now you want everything to be just fine and dandy? Suuuuure!

I smell fear.

MIL doesn’t want to sit and be told that she was wrong and have to swallow the fact that she knows that she is. She would have to give up her victimhood.  FIL has a role to play here, as well. He likes to think he can offer up parenting advice that even the worst of parents would find to be common sense and look like he’s a parenting sage.

So my wife and I had to resort to writing an email in return. I’d planned on having them in the house to speak to. I was so pissed about it that I had to get what I wanted to say out of my head, so I typed it out in a Word document. I’d organized them like notes for a speech and had even prepared to walk into the room with a book or magazine in hand, just so they didn’t see my remarks printed out. I so wanted to tell them, in the most polite way possible, how it was going to be. They couldn’t even handle the idea of having to sit and listen to what we had to say. My notes were incorporated into the email along with what my wife had to say. That was it. I know we won’t hear a thing about it. It just gets sent out, read, and then life floats along like this didn’t happen.

That *reeeaaalllllyyy* changed things for me. My wife is used to this shit. Her family, somehow, has managed to remain close despite veteran-level narcissism. She’s used this sort of shit happening and blowing over, with valleys of peace in between. I’m not. This is the first time in the 9 years we’ve been together that something like this has involved me to such an extent. They don’t just get to shit on me and pretend like it didn’t happen. I’m not ok with that. 

They still wanted to watch our daughter over the weekend, while we celebrated our anniversary. I told my wife if she felt strongly about it, then we would do it. Otherwise, I didn’t want our daughter there, I wanted her with us. If we’re such an imposition for them with our in-house decisions, why would we drop our daughter off with them?

In the end, we dropped her off for the night. I spoke only when necessary and made myself scarce otherwise. I made sure to thank them. That was it. I had nothing to say. It was the same routine the next day when we went to pick her up. Except this time, I extended my hand when I said thank you. My FIL shook it and grumbled, like I was the one who fucking did something.

They watch our daughter on Thursday. I’m building up some extra leave time by working over, before the baby is born. I’m normally home when they arrive and I’m the first one home before they leave. Not this time. I will make sure I’m gone before they arrive and I’ll leave work at a time that I know my wife will arrive before I will, which is typically about a half hour after I get home. That way they’re gone before I get home. I don't want to have to exchange false pleasantries with them. 

Something will come up again in the future when they notice I’m not interacting with them. As far as I’m concerned, until Thanksgiving, I have nothing to say. You basically questioned who I am as an adult and then force me to defend myself via email. Which is basically like ignoring me. Until I get to be heard face to face and/or an apology, I’m fine letting this relationship whither."
929,"Well, DH is back in the FOG, but doing more to stick up for me and has come to an understanding that I am not sacrificing my mental health to make ""mommy dearest"" happy. He stays off my back, but its nothing me how much he is okay with her just going on with him like she didn't almost drive his wife and mother of his child to the brink of death. But that's more of a rant for JustNoSO. I'll get to how it relates though.

DH has started accepting help from his parents again, much to my disdain. I have nothing to do with it though and I'm just waiting for UAV to hold it against him. This most recent thing is they came by our house (didn't come inside) and picked up some propane tanks that we needed to have recertified and refilled. They picked them up last night and brought them back tonight. When they left, DH came in with two toys that they had gotten for our son when they were still watching him. One is a rocking horse that is kind of bulky.

Last time I saw these toys was in July at their house. DH told me that they were in storage. This just ruffles my feathers a bit. 1) UAV has always had a habit of just bringing us stuff we didn't ask for. I even remember specifically telling her not to get my son any more toys because he had too many to fit in our small home and then a few days later she brought us a big bag filled with toys for him and just said, ""I couldn't help myself"". It was not discussed before hand if she could bring these to us. It wouldn't be really a problem if they were small toys, but the rocking horse is bulky and already, I have kept having to push it around and out of the way multiple times to get to stuff in his bedroom (the only place for the thing). If I had known they wanted to just give it to us, I would have told them to just keep it in storage.

This brings us to number 2. Why wasn't it just left in storage? If they didn't want it with their stuff, they could have just put it in ours. It just doesn't make sense why she had to take it out of storage and bring it to our house. And number 3) we will soon be finding out if we are getting custody of my husband's two daughters and we need all the room we can get to be able to house three kids in our small home. I have a theory though about why she did it this way.

When she found out that she would be taking care of DS a bit, she went out and bought every usable toy at every Goodwill within a 50 mile radius. She bought so many toys for him, there was hardly any room in her livingroom anymore. Great, loving grandparents and all that and it would be kept at their place, so no issue with me. But now, after she has realized that they likely won't get more than the couple of hours a month they get to see DS when DH is home and goes to visit them, she has a bunch of useless (to them) baby toys.

I think she is going to try and start bringing a majority of those toys to our place to leave instead of putting them in storage. I think part of it is she still wants to be the ""loving grandma that spoils her grandbaby"" (but will bail on her other grandkids when things don't go her way) and that's why she doesn't want to just put the toys on our side of the storage and be done with it. She needs to show off that she is generously giving us these toys that she spent so much money on.

I have a feeling that this is just the first of a long stream of her trying to give us all these toys that we do not have room for nor want (DS has PLENTY of toys, trust me). And of course, I worry about DH not standing his ground against his mother since he's slipped back in the FOG and will just accept whatever she gives (because I can't take anything from her while I'm not talking to her) even if I tell him not to take anything for all the reasons listed above. I feel the pot stirring with this.

Tl;dr - UAV just gave us some large toys that she had previously gotten for DS. She said they were in storage (which we share with them) and instead of leaving it on our side, she decided it was best to bring it to our home, where we don't have a lot of room for it and don't want it. She has a crapton of toys and I bet she will be doing this with all (or most) of them. My theory is she still wants to be ""loving gma"" and show off how loving she is by giving them to us in person, while quietly shifting them out of her home and not asking us if we even need to want them."
930,"Previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ddipe9/druggie\_diva\_wants\_to\_buy\_my\_lo\_a\_birthday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ddipe9/druggie_diva_wants_to_buy_my_lo_a_birthday/)

So I spent time hemming and hawing over and dragging my feet over what to do, when I already knew what I have to do. But I think I needed time to process, because I really never wanted to reach this point at all, and I kept hoping if I just did not react, she'd stop. However, she's not going to. What kicked me into gear, however, actually turned out to be innocent, but I realized I need to take action because she won't stop. My husband and I shouldn't be having panic attacks over things like mail with my family name on it, and getting a card from a relative who 100% supports us, but who also has our family name (it's an unusual non-white family name) isn't healthy or normal, and I have to do something. 

So what I did first was, after posting here, I had a long talk with some of my closest friends. One offered to be the go between, but I feel terrible putting them in the middle. So today I downloaded an app where you can get a free number if you use it frequently, and I texted her. I used a different area code to hopefully throw her off (though I won't hold my breath) and I told her that I had been informed she wanted to get a birthday gift, but I didn't think that was appropriate, all things considered, and I have no intention of ever contacting her again. I also said that if she continued to do this, even through other people, that I would be forced to escalate things through the court system. I then blocked her. I took screenshots of the texts as well, for my records, and then I'll delete the app in a bit. 

I also discussed a C&amp;D with another friend, as I have no money to spare for a lawyer at the moment, and she said things like that you can send yourself. So I looked up a template, filled it out, and I'll be mailing it via certified letter this week. If I have to I will follow through with what I told her and I'll take the next steps, but I'm hoping that the addiction will take over and she will drop it instead of risking everything as it stands. 

I've also had to come to terms with the fact that I'm not going to repair any of the relationships on her side of the family, barring my grandma and maybe a few cousins, because I wasn't the one who damaged them and I am not the one who is acting the way Druggie Diva is, let alone trying to rug sweep her destructive behavior. I can't change them, but I can work on accepting that they were never the people I thought they were, and that they were only really there as a matter of convenience on their part. I am not responsible for their behavior, and I'm not accepting the blame. 

It's been a bad brain day, but I feel like I handled it well. I think it's natural to be sad, all things considered, and that I am going to mourn them, much like I did with my jndad and Druggie Diva. I have a therapist who can help me work through these feelings in the meantime. 

I also went over my plan with DH in case she does show up. I'm hoping she's not that desparate, but I guess we'll see. 

Thank you everyone who has helped me with this. It's not over, and I feel like it never will be, but I'm trying my hardest to keep moving forward. I can't provide for my family if I stay stuck in the past, so I'm trying my best to do that. I feel like I'm slogging through hip deep mud, but there will be an end to all this eventually. 

I don't really need advice, as far as I can see I've got things pretty well covered, but if anyone can think of anything I am more than willing to listen. 

I know Druggie Diva's behavior is not my fault, but I still feel responsible. Going NC with jndad first helped show me that it doesn't last forever though. At least there is that."
931,"TW: ableism

Growing up, mom would pretend I wasn't disabled. She'd get real angry when I wouldn't do chores and I said it was because it hurt. She knew I had fatigue, but took me on long walks/shopping trips/etc. and would yell at me for sitting. On the other hand, sometimes she would flip out because my pain looked ""valid"" enough that she'd force me to the ER. It wasn't something they could help with, which I told her, but she took me and afterwards got angry for ""having to waste the trip."" So basically she flip flopped on whether I was disabled or not, and punished me either way.

Recently, she had a bad accident with spine damage. She says that just standing is exhausting and her arms are on fire. She apologized for dismissing my pain back then.

I don't know how to feel about this."
932,"So, I have been married for 4 years, together for 5 and we are expecting our first child in a few months. 

I’ve really disliked my MIL from the start but never thought about it too deeply, just never met someone like her in my life. 

In the early days, she used to offer to pay for my husbands haircuts, but then tell him how to cut it/try to get me to agree with her about his haircut. That never worked. I always supported my partner or brother in law/sister in law when she’d try to control or manipulate them. 

Since I am from another country than my husband and his family, we ended up having two weddings. Initially, I thought I’d only have 1 wedding, but from the start, I saw that wedding wasn’t actually mine. She started playing songs she thought we should use the morning after we shared our engagement news, she chose the type of music to be played at the reception, picked my wedding meal, told me “salads were not nice enough for weddings” despite going to other weddings and the first course was almost always a salad... you get the picture. For her speech, didn’t say a word about me. Just the life story of her son, the oldest, her golden child that I stole from her. She often made jokes about coming along on our honeymoon. 

Speaking of the honeymoon, she didn’t give us much peace as usual, but the worst was when she video called us on a FRIDAY night during our honeymoon! Needless to say, I refused to speak to her. That caused a huge fight between my husband and I because she started crying of course. 

Generally, my husband and his siblings avoid upsetting her at all costs. My SIL has been teaching me subtle things to get her off my case, and admits her mother tries to control everything.  It’s not wonder she married someone from another country to escape her. It’s hard for me to just sit by and give this 60 year old woman what she wants all the time because I see the manipulation, lack of boundaries and control behind her actions. 

I have been stressed about how’d she react about me being pregnant and how she’d behave during my pregnancy/the delivery. Of course she thinks she’s trying to name our baby despite my husband and I telling her multiple times that she isn’t picking the name/ we aren’t revealing it until he comes because we don’t want others’ opinions. It’s so weird, she doesn’t listen or something because she’ll repeatedly ask about the same things over and over again and then thinks it’s funny when her kids are irritated that she’s asked the same thing so many times and actually tell her to stop. She’s making my pregnancy about her as expected. Talking about what she did when she was pregnant and what she ate, etc.  I shared my registry with her as a nice way to include her despite it not being a cultural norm here. She refuses to use the registry  and wants to buy what she wants to buy for the baby. She’ll buy something and my husband doesn’t want to upset her but then he’s even annoyed because she wants more attention about incorrect things she’s purchased. She doesn’t care about my preferences or research, and doesn’t seem to get it that my husband and I are perfectly capable and don’t need her help on how to set our nursery or anything baby related. I have worked with children most of my life, my sister has two under two, not to mention I’ve supported my friends when they needed help throughout the years. I got this and when I don’t I’ll figure it out without her.

What do you all think? Is she a narcissist? Any tips on how to deal with her?"
933,"Does anyone have advice on how to get my mil to STOP bothering me about putting my 3 month old on a schedule? She has been telling me to put him on a schedule since she found out I was pregnant. Everytime time I speak with her, she tells me to do this. She never asks how the baby is. She has told me this, with no exaggeration, over 20 times. Every interaction we have she mentions it. I want to tell her she is totally stupid, and that I heard her the first 20 times, but thats obviously not a good way to go about it. She will be texting me tomorrow about it no doubt, and I'd like to have something to say that is firm but not nasty."
934,"Okay, this just happened so I'm a little frazzled. I don't know if I was being a giant b*tch or what. 

My SIL is pregnant (yay! I'm so excited to be an aunt!) I'm not on social media a whole lot so I don't know if she's posted many pictures of her pregnancy or not. My mother called me after I got out of class tonight and told me the next time I see SIL to get a picture of her. I guess my mother hasn't seen any pregnancy photos of her...
I told her I thought that was weird and I don't know if SIL wants pictures of herself sent out or if she's comfortable with that. SIL is a twig and isn't used to having a big belly like this (chubby squad unite!) So she may just be super uncomfortable. I don't want to put her in that situation at all. 
She said, ""Well I'm the MIL I get pictures.""
So I told her that's kinda a narcissist sentence. 
She got pissy with me and said I was being very rude. So I told her I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude and I'm not calling you a narcissist. I'm just saying that phrase, the way you said it, sounds narcissistic. Because it's not about you. 
So she just said whatever, I'm tired, bye.

Am I being horrible here? I know my normal meter is broken and I've been pandering to my mother's feelings all my life but at some point I have to say no, it's not okay right? I don't even think it was that bad??
Help me out here Reddit."
935,"[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/cq4kgm/the_step_momster_caused_dh_to_have_a_bad/)  Trigger Warning for the link, and trigger warning for post : Food aversions and issues.  Posted the flair as Update - NAW but I feel it's also a success in our agreement on something!!

D(ear)Husband and myself randomly got back onto this topic, as we discussed our plans to try to conceive, family boundaries we want to place, and approaches to parenting.  Food became the topic. I have been recently branching out to eating and trying food I've previously expressed that I don't care for, DH has .... well, not.  He tried for a bit, and then just fell back into old habits. That's okay, it takes time and I can't pressure him to do something before he's ready, especially with his history with TSM forcing him to eat a tiny green vegetable he didn't like.

He expressed he will have to ""suck it up and eat vegetables"" in front of any LOs we have. I told him we just need to find the type of vegetable he'll eat on a regular basis and switch it up with a certain type of salad he's grown to like.  I told him ""Sucking it up isn't healthy.  You need to enjoy the food you are eating, otherwise  you will be left feeling unsatisfied after the meal."" He agreed, and he said his default vegetable growing up was always corn (this is STILL my default veggie, so it's something we can both eat and enjoy).  He also said, ""I will NEVER force my child to eat something they don't like.  If we have to cook three different types of vegetables then so be it.""  I agreed with him, doing the dishes will suck, but it will be worth it in the long run.

I asked him about the times TSM made him sit at the dining room table for hours, and where FIL was.  Turns out this only happened when FIL was picking up shifts at a side job to keep them afloat, and it started before TSM and FIL were even married.  She was asserting herself as a parent in the wrong way, and FIL had ZERO clue his son was being forced to stay up for hours over this. DH has harbored a lot of anger towards her.  It also turns out he waited until FIL was home one evening to force feed himself so he would throw up on the table to burst TSM's bubble of ""Look what I got him to do while you've been at work, I'm the *peeerrrrrfeeeeeecccctttt* parent."" We also discussed what one lovely user pointed out : this reaction could mean an allergic reaction, and something we need to look into, he was thankful for the information and agreed to look into it.

I blurted out, ""Over my dead body will TSM feed OUR child.""  He replied with ""Absolutely, she'll never touch our child/children.""  (Funny side note : we call her The Step Momster among ourselves and with our best friends)

I was so happy to hear him say this, and he agreed with some other boundaries (posting pictures without permission on social media was the main one we spoke about, other than food).

DH has a shiny spine, but I'm worried about GMIL (FIL's mom) and SIL (TSM's bio kid) trying to force us to let TSM have a relationship with our future LOs.  DH and I originally weren't inviting TSM or her family to our wedding, but GMIL guild tripped us with ""She helped raised you"" and DH has no spine when it comes to GMIL, and honeslty, I don't either.  She is amazing 99.9% of the time, has helped us so much, welcomed me into the family, and spoils me like I'm her own grandchild.  TSM going to the wedding was absolutely the only issue we've ever had with her. And SIL ... well ... she's STILL pushing for TSM and Co. and FIL's side to be ""one big happy family"".  I honestly think she's seen too many Hallmark movies where there's a bunch of nuclear families always coming together and not having their own lives or holiday traditions.

We will cross the bridge with GMIL and SIL when the time comes.  I have TSM not giving DH a birthday card after we sent her a card and gift for Mother's Day, after we made sure she was treated so well at our rehearsal and wedding (went all out to get her Mother of the Groom stuff, matching the amount of stuff we got for the dads and my mom) in my back pocket as evidence that she doesn't deserve anything.  DH's birthday is one day away from SIL's, there's no excuse to ever forget it, and TSM remembers to get FIL Father's Day stuff (birthdays fall around Father's Day almost every year).

I just want her to know I'm keeping score.  She's playing a bitch game, this is her bitch prize.

Edit : words"
936,"My hubs brought up a good story- not a great memory mind, but a very good example of when Nomom’s mask slipped. Old story- so no real advice needed.


When I was pregnant with kid and everyone was excited. One of my siblings had asked in advance to know kid’s gender once we found out. Cool right?

Well not if you don’t tell Nomom right the freaken second you find out. 

 We had gone to the appointment like normal and were enjoying watching kid paddle around for the camera (not me so much since being flat on my back really sucked), when we caught kid’s gender and the tech had to step out a moment. So me being a diligent sibling I texted my sib what we found out.

Apparently sib held that over nomom’s head and gloated about this. Because we got multiple texts and phone messages to “call now” “call when you can” 

My heart sunk. I could already feel the outrage from my phone- how dare I? 

We waited until we got to the car and I called and I hear a teary wail “why didn’t you tell me?” Combined with “how dare you do this to your own mother” from edad. 

Like am I obligated to tell them immediately what we were having? They knew we were having a kid. At least I didn’t announce it to the book of faces- but how dare I tell Nomom last? Or at least have my feckless  sib know first. 

Thinking back on this now I really get pissed. How dare they get mad because I didn’t tell them the instant we found out. Wtf edad? Both of them came off as super entitled to kid and edad just got indigent that he had to deal with Nomom fall out. 

I’m glad we aren’t in their house."
937,"UPDATE: I DON’T KNOW HOW WE MISSED THIS. AWP gave DH a plastic bag the last time we saw her. We didn’t open it until recently. It was the top she wore to a themed party we didn’t go to......and what did the top say???? “Suck my dXXX!” But spelled out! Not with stars. Am I going crazy or does that send a....message? I asked DH why she would give us this top, and he said he doesn’t know, maybe to be funny. This is the same party she is complaining we missed (by saying she hasn’t seen us).

Hi everyone! Hopefully this one will be quick. DH and I went out to lunch with GMIL this weekend. GMIL is mom to my MIL, Amy Winepurse. 

GMIL informed us that she saw Winepurse over the weekend, and Winepurse was on her best behavior, except that she was complaining that she has not seen DH and I since our Wedding (reminder we have in fact seen Winepurse once since wedding). GMIL said, “They’re newlyweds! What do you expect?”

Also, GMIL told us that because BIL1’s bday is coming up, AWP texted GMIL to say:

“it has been (BIL1)-age years that we have done Santa phone as a family, and since DH married alletnomnom, this will be the first year we haven’t don’t it!” 

GMIL responded by reminding AWP that BIL1 is her first child, and DH was not alive (BIL1-age) years ago.

If you remember, the first time the holidays came up as a topic after DH and I were engaged, AWP told us “I will never give up Santa phone with my kids!!!!!!!!”

That’s all the info I got, but I feel a storm coming. What do you all think?"
938,My MIL shows up every Monday after she watches my niece (even though it’s naptime for some of my kids) &amp; always brings lollipops (4 per child in fact- which those all get thrown out) -My husband has asked her not to bring them anymore and she brushes us off. Well our children have mentioned their teeth hurting so obviously we start thinking well what’s not helping - so my husband calls and tells her not to walk through the door with any lollipops today or any day- she proceeded to tell him well then you better stop giving them muffins then those have a lot of sugar. Instead of saying ok no problem she tried to turn and point the finger at us - stay in your lane lady!!  We didn’t ask for your dietary opinion because if you were so concerned you wouldn’t show up with 5 million lollipops!! Am I wrong?
939,"So it all began when I was in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and we asked my MIL not to say anything. Long story short she posted it on Facebook and refused to apologize. She stated it was her first grandchild and she was spreading good news. Fast forward a couple of months and I was talking to her on Mother’s Day. I had asked her nicely why she didn’t tag me in a family picture and she blew up. She told me she tagged my SIL (husbands brothers wife) because she “considers her a DIL”. That comment HURT, but I didn’t start the conversation looking for a fight so I invited her walk around the Mother’s Day festival. Fast forward to my sons birth. She booked a vacation to Italy. For someone who was so excited about her grand child she has been remarkably uninvolved. Now my son is one. MIL went through 6 weeks of chemo, so I get that was tough. I tried to be there as much as I could, but she has grown more and more distant. She used to contact me every week or so now it’s every month. She comes over and acts like everything is okay, but there’s so much lingering tension. Additionally, my SIL (my MIL only DIL apparently) is now pregnant with her first. They are close in both proximity and relationship wise. I don’t have a great relationship with SIL either. I just feel like SIL’s child is going to be favored over mine. I feel ostracized from their family for not being religious, for not being raised in a small town, for being too liberal. My husband has my back at least. His relationship with his mom and SIL are so so, but better than mine. I just don’t know where to go from here. We are going to MIL family house this weekend out of state and I feel awkward as usual."
940,"This is a little update to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/corh99/my_mil_is_playing_mind_games_and_it_makes_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I am dyslexic and like to swear, have a fun ride!

To recap really quick, I'm NC with my MIL for 3 years now. My LO and DH are VLC. We let LO choose when to see MIL, and unsupervised visits are fine, as aunties often take this opportunity to visit LO as well. The 3 aunties are over a decade younger than DH so they are all just entering their mid 20's. They often tell me what MIL says about me, now that they have come out of the fog. MIL really showed her ass not realizing I gave them all a heads up I was going NC and why, then MIL tried to play dumb and the victim. 

ANYWAYS. So I found out from LO that MIL knows what's all over my IG account despite the fact she is blocked, and has not physically seen me in 3 years. As stated in my last post LO heard Aunties and Grandma talking so many nice things about me! LO elaborated (randomly, and unprovoked over the last month or so) that it was about how my hair looks so nice (I grew out my natural colour), that my yard work looks great, and that I am so talented with a hobby I do (that I took up after I went NC). Well isn't that just fucking interesting. Are the Aunties showing her? I mean, they are young and their mom is annoying. I don't really give a fuck if they are. But wtf? But what had happened 2 days before all this went down is a new IG account for MIL(the 3rd one in so many years) popped up as a suggestion for me. I clicked on it, it has no followers, and was not following anyone no one in common yet. Now the way these algorithms work is if you stalk an account enough, they will suggest that you be friends. My MIL ""forgot"" her password for her IG for the second time in 3 year, could not recover it for some unknown reason, and had to start yet another account. I thought I was being paranoid and self centered when I saw it pop up and blocked it. But add that to what she apparently was praising about me and it's just weird. Also add that to it's happened to her facebook 3 times as well. Groan. Her new facebook accounts always pop up for me as a suggestion too, but by then we have a bunch of mutual friends. It also makes me kind of happy that she is that desperate to see what I am up to? It's kind of pathetic. The best revenge is living a good life right? Bahahaha.

I had talked to DH about the game she is playing with the ""Say hi to Magpie for meeee!!"" and he didn't get it at first, how it was to make her look sweet, and like she was trying to be nice, and me look nasty and immature for not talking to her. I asked him if we needed to go over everything she did, the years of abuse, how horrible she was, how neither her or FIL took any responsibility, apologized to me, or even to him for putting him in between. I said the whole ""I said I didn't want to talk to her. You are allowing her to talk to me by passing on her hellos. If she actually wanted to be nice and fix things she would make a real effort. The only thing she cares about is appearing nice to you. It's working. You can't have it both ways. You can't tell me 'you said you don't want to talk to her' and pass on her messages."" That was his arguement for when I said if she wanted to be nice and fix it she would actually try to reach out directly to me, was that she couldn't because I said I didn't want to talk to her. That really got through to him. He said ""You're right, me saying hello to you for her is her talking to you. I'm sorry. It won't happen again."" I told him the ideal thing would be for him to stand up to her and tell her no next time she said it, but that I understand him not doing it. She just doesn't get it, and it won't make a difference. The big talk where he went over and told both MIL and FIL why I went NC didn't get through to them. They came away from that thinking DH was closer to them and that I was just having a tantrum! It really snapped DH out of the fog. So I told him if he doesn't want to say no, that's fine, as long as he doesn't say yes. Just do the non committal noise and shrug it off. 

So we are good on that front, and just the other day we had to stop by there to drop stuff off, and he was in there for several minutes, came out, and passed no messages. There was no grumpiness from the encounter. It was good! Her games don't work, when no one is playing, and it's especially fun when she thinks the game is still on!

Edit: the typos I could see. Lol"
941,"So, it turns out that my JNDad is not so JN as it may seem and that MomaRex has been lying to me since the beginning of this whole ordeal between my parents 4 years ago.

Am I surprised? No, not really.

Am I disappointed? Most definitely.

I have posted about my father before to give some background to some issues MR needs to deal with it. 

Mainly how she is obsessed with my alcohol consumption and is convinced that I will become an alcoholic like him and whatnot. I also posted last when MR announced that my father had a new baby which is true, a quick book of faces stalking can tell you that much. I also mentioned how my father had a psychotic breakdown 4 years ago that resulted in him losing custody and visitation rights to YS.

Most of that is real and the truth. MR can’t really hide that as I was a witness to most events that happened, but she lied about the little things. Things that I was not there to witness myself and I just had to take her word on it.

So, when I met with my father last Friday, we took the time to compare notes. It was clearly not our first rodeo as I had all the proof on my phone and he had his side of the story with receipts on his.

\- He is married to his mail in order bride, now referred to as my step-mom or SM. No, he did not get married on YS’s birthday, but on his sister’s (JNAunt) birthday (JNAunt and JNPGM are still pissed about it).

\- He has a job and has been working for a whole year. Therefore, he has been paying child support for the past year. Yes, he was unemployed for a few months between jobs because his industry is hard to find jobs now that Amazon has taken over basically everything and he didn’t want another job where his bosses were assholes. Also, child support is automatically deducted from his paycheck.

\- He has been in contact with MR. He has to declare his address and phone number to her whenever either change in case something happens to YS and he needs to be contacted.

\- He has been living in the same apartment for the past few years. So, he’s not homeless like she said he was.

\- Yes, he has a baby. No, she wasn’t planned and she is not a replacement for me or YS.

\- No, he has not been anywhere near the town MR’s lives in or the house since he went back to clean up after the tenant that lived in there since MR couldn’t get out of her lease and he no longer wanted to live there.

\- He is not obsessed with her and wants her back or anything like that. He is happy where he is now with his wife and the new baby. If anything, he missed YS and me a lot but understood that we needed to keep our distance and needed time and we would contact him when we were ready.

I’m sure there is a lot more, but it was the first time that we were seeing each other in 4 years so we obviously did not take the little time we had together to just talk shit about MR. We also took the time to get to know each other again.

I feel betrayed and oh so naïve for believing MR when she has a history to lie to me and try to brainwash me into hating my father, but I am so glad to be back in contact with my father. I missed him so much and life just wasn’t the same without him. I’m glad that he is well, alive and healthy.

I also talked to SM on the phone the next day and I am officially unblocked and friended on the book of faces and receiving pictures of my new sibling.

And, MR is now on a time out while I try to rebuild my relationship with my father and her phone number is blocked until further notice.

I will be discussing with my therapist this week how to proceed with MR and also how to tell YS the news.

Until then, thanks for reading."
942,"Tempted to flair this as ""Give it to me straight"" but I'll take all advice. On mobile, apologies for typos and other errors.

My SO(28) is the oldest of 5, put himself through school and now has a decent job and makes good money. My FMIL doesn't have a lot of money and needs help with bills. Her husband passed away a few years ago, they got a very nice insurance payment and used that money to buy a house. When bills come up and FMIL can't afford them while taking care of the other 3 in the house she turns to my SO and his oldest sister (26 and just recently married a very successful doctor) to help her with the bills. On its face I have no problem with this, but now I've been close enough to this family and I see the problems with their spending habits. 

FMIL will ask for larger sums of money for car payments / repairs, yearly taxes on the house, electric (or other) bills she can't pay on time. My SO feels obligated to help her because he's the oldest and in his mind it's now his responsibility to help his younger siblings get the best possible quality of care growing up without their dad now. As much as I think this is noble, I also happen to think it's shortsighted because we're getting married in a few months and he can't be spending up to $5000 on his mom's annual property tax. 

But now his mom wants his help to buy his 2 youngest siblings (18 and 16) new laptops. This I am very against. The 18 year old just got accepted to college with a full ride scholarship and money left over and the 16 year old has a perfectly good desk top computer all to himself. As well, there are at least 3 older working laptops in his mom's house that no one is using because they're ""old"". 

I. Want. To. Scream. 

The laptop I've been using is older then all other their old laptops but I've taken care of it so it's still in excellent condition. His mom wants his siblings to have either a new Surface Pro or a ThinkPad of T-series or higher and she wants my SO to pay for them. 

I've been trying to understand this, and I've been trying to find alternative solutions to buy brand new laptops but everytime we bring up a refurbished option or a joint payment option it gets shut down. To her, refurbished just means it's not as good as new and won't last and she can't afford to but half down on a new expensive laptop. 

My SO isn't sure how to get out of this because he feels so obligated to help and he technically does have the disposable income to pay for these new laptops but we have a wedding coming up in less then 6 months. We cannot actually afford this but his mom will not leave us alone. 

I've talked it out with my SO, and he doesn't disagree with me but he says it's not so simple for him to say no and I just don't get it because I don't have siblings or a parent relying on me. To which I reminded him that one of his sisters (24) is literally mooching off everyone and taking expensive international trips to ""find herself"" and the other also has a well paying job and very well off new doctor husband. This doesn't all have to fall to him. 

My question I'm trying to get to is, my SO and I are united in that we are not buying these brand new laptops but how can we tell his mom this so she leaves us alone?"
943,"This is a continuation of DH seeing first-hand how low key shitty JNMIL can be. 


My birthday was this past Tuesday, and I received ""HBD"" messages from many people. It was very nice and I was so appreciative! But you know who I didn't hear from? JNMIL. 


This past weekend, DH took me out to a nice dinner and we took some snazzy pics together. Many compliments all around-- except from JNMIL. Honestly, I didn't realize her silence in either event until last night.

DH was chatting on the phone with her for an hour or so. I didn't pay attention, as I was getting ready for the next day. But DH comes up to me after they hung up and said ""My mom says Happy Birthday. She says she's sorry she didn't say anything.""


Now, I know what some of you may be thinking.

""She said Happy Birthday, what's the big deal? She did what you wanted"" But that's not what I see.


I asked him why she couldn't just message me. He said she was busy and that's why. I countered that even JNGMIL said Happy Birthday. He didn't have an answer. 


I swear, the woman just cannot swallow her pride. 



Then he mentions her birthday is next week. I respond with 

""I'll be sure to message her and send a gift.""


He called me petty. And I said ""Yes the fuck I am.""




TL;DR JNMIL is too prideful to even say Happy Birthday


Edit: A lot of people think that because I'm getting her a gift and saying HBD, that it isn't petty. And maybe it's not.  But I'm not stooping to her level. People already see her for what she is, and I wanna keep it that way. 


Maybe I won't give her gift. But I will make it BLATANTLY clear I'm a better person. You know what? Maybe I'll give a nice gift to my SMIL. Since she's been more of a mother/MIL to us than Ally Alcoholic."
944,"I don't know how to deal with JNMIL, she is very sweet, she always does extra for making everyone around her feel welcome and part of the family. She treated me really well when I spent some days at her house to make feel welcome, but if there's one little thing that goes out of her way, she goes nuts and drives everyone crazy.

She is that kind of person that lives to complain. She needs to complain about anything, so if her life is great, she will pick up a fight with someone just to have someone to complain later to everyone.

She believes 100% in God, and I respect that, but all the answers she has for everything, is God! I have a serious nut allergy, I told her that and she said that I don't need to worry about that anymore, because God will heal me and I won't feel sick ever again. That no food from her house will make me sick, even with nuts everywhere.

I don't want to get married because I believe it's a waste of money and I don't need that to say to the world that I love someone. She was super stressed, arguing with everyone of the family everyday of the week before her nieces wedding, and during the party she came to me and asked: everything is so beautiful, don't you think? Doesn't this make you want to get married?

She never wanted children, but she had 3 because she believes women are made to be mothers. She always tell her sons that she never wanted them, but she lives them and she doesn't regret, but if she could go back to the past and do it all over again, she wouldn't have children. I don't want children, I never did, and I don't think I ever will, and guess what she tells me everyday? ""WHEN you give me my grandchildren, I will spoil them all"". I told her that I don't want kids, and she said that God will make me have babies and I will change my mind, that I will give her a lot of granddaughters and grandsons.

The last one she did was send my BF walls of text saying that he needs to stop spoiling me, because she doesn't have money to pay for our bills. She understands that he wants to be a gentleman and pay everything for me, but he needs to stop that. I NEVER LET HE PAY ANYTHING FOR ME!! I feel terrible that she thinks I'm using his money, even though I make more money than he does and I pay a lot of things for him. He pays 1/3 of our rent, and I pay 2/3 because we love our house and we want to live here, and it doesn't matter to me if I'm paying a little more, it doesn't affect me in anyway, and she had the nerve to say I'm taking money from them!

And last, but not least, we were talking about personal hygiene, I said something about how guys always have that last drop of pee on the underwear and my BF said he doesn't have it, because he always washes and dries after peeing. She looked at him outraged and said that this is gay, that men need to be men, and he needs to smell like pee. JYFIL said that he did the same, that this is basic hygiene, and she got out of the room complaining that this is gay and she needs macho men around her.

I don't know how to talk with her anymore. I try, but I just can't. Makes me sick to think about getting close to her and I don't know what to do. I feel it's rude to go NC since she didn't do anything against me, but I feel anxious and uncomfortable to have to deal with her."
945,"I want to rant but I could also use advice, sorry if I picked the wrong flair.

So I've been living with my boyfriend and his family for about 6 months now after moving out of a mentally abusive household (my foo). Everyone here has their moments where they can be impossible.. except my boyfriend's mother. She CONSTANTLY is impossible. She likes to make everything about her and only her. If people go out she gets really annoyed if they don't bring her anything back or if they bring her back something and it's not what she wants (even though she didnt ask for anything and she's Super picky). Things in the house have to get done when she wants and how she wants (even though she never gets off the couch) or she has a tantrum that sometimes includes throwing things. There is currently mold growing on the ceiling in the room me and my so share and we've talked to both her and my so's father about it they've told us they can't do anything about since they have to do the ceiling in their room first which apparently  has ""water leaks"" despite them not having a single wet spot on it. She won't let anything happen unless it benefits her in some way. She keeps telling my so's sister (who also lives here) that she shouldn't be using the mother's car to go out and see her so because it's ""unnecessary mileage"". My boyfriend's mother has tried to make me an sg at least a handful of times now. I'm very lucky though tbh because every time she tries to do that my so sticks up for me. When she can't use me the blame falls on her children (my so, and his sister) and her husband (their father). I'm not joking when say she blamed my so for causing ""all of her stress"" and screamed in his face last night when he was just sitting in his chair before she stormed off to her car saying she was going on a drive for some alone time leaving my so/her son ready to cry. After storming out there slamming doors the whole way she came back in with ""Look I dont want to be upset with you, you just need to stop."" . That had my blood boiling, my so did NOTHING; and I couldn't say anything about it. Theres an unspoken rule not to oppose or question her which she takes advantage of. If someone speaks back to her in any way she doesnt like she'll play whatever card she has to to get above them. 90% of the time she makes excuses to boss all of us around while she sits in her sunken in spot on the couch. She doesnt have a job and hasnt for a long time believing working is below her. She only has any money because she makes my so and his sister pay her 150$ either a month or every fortnight to continue living here. I'd be paying that amount to her to if I could have a job (on a tourism visa). She also expects whatever extra money they make if the get more money then they thought they would come payday. She takes cannabis oil for her illnesses that I wont get into and she *forgot* to save the 300$ it costs her to buy the small vial she gets, so now my so is going to pay for it for her. Is it really bad of me to wish she'd just f off? My so is a family guy, he likes his family and just wants peace. I don't want to break his relationship from his family.. I just dont know what to do or if I'm overreacting. Today she told me my so had apparently had a conversation with them about removing some furniture from the room and getting stuff she found online for free to pick up and putting that in where the old stuff was. When I confronted my so about this change that I wasn't told about (it's OUR room so i should get an opinion but didn't) he said he never decided this and the mother and his sister were pushing this on him. I only got to a picture of the ugly thing that the owner even calls a carcass that I'm going to have to look at for who knows how many more years right before they left to pick it up... What sickens me the most about this is what the mother said before they left ""The seller also has glass doors, you know what I LIKE, only take them if you think they look good"". (The carcass thing might come here with disgusting doors, great.). Also she wants to get rid of the dressers in my so and I's room that came as a set with the bed... 

If you guys have any advice or anything please let me know.. She drives me nuts and I dont know how long I can boil before I explode at her.."
946,"Just a little background: My husband has 2 older brothers and a younger sister. His mom very clearly kept having children until she had a daughter because she is her pride and joy while her sons are COMPLETELY forgotten about. JYFIL and JNMIL have recently divorced. JNMIL never sees her sons, doesn’t contact them except for when she needs things and they were raised in a household that doesn’t show affection so DH never realized how messed up the relationship was until we started dating. 

Anyways, DH’s birthday is today and one of his brothers and his sisters birthday is in 10 days (not twins just the same birthday). About 3 weeks ago his mom calls saying she wants to take all 4 of her kids and their spouses out to dinner to celebrate their birthdays. She just misses them so much and wants to all get together. JNSIL is single, BIL1 is married to a women no one is really a fan of (she didn’t come to this extravaganza) and JYBIL2 is engaged. 

We get there last night and she’s giving everyone hugs and kisses and is “so happy to see my babies!” We get a table and the first thing she tells the waiter is that we are splitting our checks. Maybe I’m being a brat and being selfish but don’t invite your kids out for their birthdays and spring on them oh your paying. She picked out an expensive restaurant that she wanted to go to. 

BIL1 is older and owns a business and can afford it so it wasn’t a problem with him, JYBIL2 just moved home from across the country and is currently living in his fiancées parents basement and both of them work retail jobs because they took what they could get to leave the crappy situation they were in before they moved. They are also planning and paying for a wedding. Between my husband and I, we have 5 jobs just to make it by. JNSIL lives at home with mom, rent free and has a decent paying job. But JNMIL pays for JNSIL. The two birthday boys get cards just signed “mom” while they birthday girl gets a card with a check in it. 

Again, maybe I’m being a brat saying it’s unfair. But don’t invite your kids out for a birthday dinner at a fancy/expensive restaurant at your choosing then make them pay for it! If you want to take your kids out for their birthday, pay for dinner and make it a gift for them. OR If you plan to make them pay, pick somewhere that isn’t expensive! I got a chicken club and water and my husband got a pizza and a beer and it was 70 just for the 2 of us! 

Am I unreasonably upset?

Edit: typo on cost of dinner"
947,"Okay so I have too many long stories about my partners family (step-dad in particular but I can't find a thread for that and quite a bit to do with his mum too so I figured it fit here?) I'm just going to start with a list of things. He we go 

TW: physical abuse (animals &amp; humans)

Little bit of background on his family, his mum had him at 18 and his dad is a drop kick drug dealer that abused his wife (step-mum). Mil married step-dad and had 3 kids (1 boy 2 girls, all under 12 atm). Has 3 Chihuahuas, 2 girls 1 boy.

-anti vaxx for not just the kids but the dogs too
- bought a cat for a Christmas gift only to hate it and mil abuse it (kicking, shoving, keeping outside for days, not feeding or giving clean water, not desexing it and have 2 litters very close together &amp; never went to the vet for the pregnancy) the girls ended up treating the cat the same way. {They gave her away when they moved to a nice old lady}
- mil having a very strong opinions on my anti depressant/anxiety meds and the contraceptive pill I'm on and getting mad at me for rebutting and telling my partner they're worried about him being around me because I don't seem mentally stable 
- charging him $200 a week in rent if he took a higher paying job instead of staying at a fast food place
- demanding all debt (from the rent, buying a car off them and other things) to be paid in cash and with a time limit 
- move 3 hours away and expect him to drive to them once a month 
- don't use shampoo or conditioner (kids hair is washed with lemons, dog shampoo or bicarb soda) because mil thinks shampoo and conditioner is really really bad for hair
- let the dogs have 3-4 litters within just under 2 years and only got the boy desexed (No vet visits for those pregnancy either)
- guilt trip him into feeling like shit because he can't see them all the time now or only spending a weekend with them (he can't take time off work because he needs money) 
- got hair extensions and turned then into dreads (both mil and sfil did this)
- wouldn't teach him how to drive and help him get his 100 hours up (australia) so my mum had to take him driving and helped him with his hours 
- when mil and sfil were only dating and SO was only little sfil would drag him by the hair if he didn't come when called, smashed his face on a table because he was being a kid and annoying him, belted him and slapped with shoes. Sfil doesn't do ANY on that with his bio kids
- almost zero discipline with the younger kids so they are constantly talking over everyone when people are trying to have a conversation 
- major conspiracy theorists, mil was watching YouTube and one day snapped and packed the family and dogs in the car and drove around for 2 months buying canned goods and water bottles and looking for places to bury them because she was convinced the world was going to end on Christmas day but they would be okay because they now live up in the mountains or something (No school for the kids in these 2 months)
- they all share toothbrushes too

And I think that's about it? Probably forgotten things but I'm sure you get the gist.

Thanks for reading, just wanted to vent somewhere. Don't even know if this post is allowed or not.

Edit: added something else I remembered"
948,"Hello again!

So my MIL, Jan Snow, has been placed upon and will forever (hopefully) remain on a permanent information diet. This stems from a lot of past events in which she's snooped, inserted herself where she does not belong, or changed things without telling us.

See, Jan Snow is a mildly-recovering helicopter parent. She hovers over everyone and everything and pouts and guilt trips when others don't do things exactly the way she expects them to be done. She's so bad about it that I often refer to her as ""Helicopter Jan"" in conversation with DH or my amazing SIL.

I'll admit, DH has previously needed some hovering. He has an attention disorder and is generally pretty forgetful. So I can understand why she felt the need to stay on top of him to get things done. But at some point, you have to let your grown ass son be a grown as man.

Some background: DH and I are in our 20s and both finishing up lucrative, difficult degree programs. We're planning to graduate in about a year or so, but have been in school for five years already. This is the first year that DH has filled out his own FAFSA and other financial aid documents. Previously, Jan Snow completed them without even telling him, ""because she knew everything and had more time."" This year is the first year he's done his own specifically because we got married.

How, you may be asking, could she complete these forms for him without his knowledge? Well, dear reader, it's because she had his master password. Read that again: SHE HAD HIS PASSWORD FOR HIS COLLEGE REGISTRATION AND FINANCIAL AID PORTAL. Now, I could understand her doing these forms for him at 17-18 and newly in college, because who ever really knows how to do those anyway? But seriously?? This actually started the only explosive argument that DH and I have ever had and was nearly the end of our relationship (before we were married, obviously). DH changed his password that day and learned to do his own financial documents.

Since then, and partially related to the premarital sex argument (see previous posts), we've kept the ILs on a fairly strict info diet. DH chats with his parents (Skype, of course. ugh.) every few weeks or so. We conveniently ""forget"" to tell them about major things in our lives. Recently DH has had to appeal a financial aid decision that would prevent us from getting any government financial aid (basically, we're taking too long to finish our degrees because we're burnt out, minoring, and freshly married) and we specifically aren't telling Jan Snow about it because we both know how much she would flip out and try to micromanage his studies. They didn't know he got a tattoo until I posted a photo of our matching ink on social media. They don't know about trips we're planning or holiday plans, or what we do day-to-day. SIL knows a good bit more, because she's awesome and would never talk.

But Jan Snow gets to know nothing."
949,"Hi all, it's been a long time since I posted, but if you recall the saga of Mad Dog 20/20:

* She's a bipolar alcoholic who we helped by getting her into rehab and letting her stay with us so she could get back on her feet after being evicted
* She decided to stay permanently in our city (4 hour drive from her hometown) and buy a house to be near her only child and future grandchild
* Immediately after moving into said house, she relapsed and started drinking again, so we went NC and told her we're happy to have her back in our lives once she's sober
* Months and months followed of her causing drama, leaving 100+ nasty voicemails for me and DH, then they finally stopped once our daughter was born. Haven't heard from her at all in several months

Now, DH is starting to feel the guilt. He really wants her to meet her granddaughter (now 5 months old) and I want to hold the boundary we set - NC until she's sober. I don't care if he wants to talk to her and see how she's doing but I feel like that's letting her win in a way. Because we left the ball in her court and a few months of silence is all it took for him to start reaching out again. Regardless of what happens now, I know the next few months will be rough because being alone for the holidays has always been her biggest trigger for drinking and refusing her meds. I really feel bad that she is so sick and feels like her only child abandoned her but sorry, that's not my problem. I am sticking by my boundaries and she can suck a dick if she thinks she's going to have a relationship with my daughter in the state she's in."
950,"All year I've been under the impression that we're traveling to another province to visit Coprolite's sick aunt for Christmas. Well the sick aunt wants to spend the holidays with immediate family only so plans have had to change. 

DH's brother lives in Colombia, and now Coprolite would like us to go there for Christmas with her. I'm very uneasy about this, traveling is difficult for me because of my ibs and I've told Coprolite this numerous times. I've done some research and it seems Colombia has very few public washrooms. I take cbd oil to give me some relief from the constant stomach cramping i have and wouldn't be able to bring it with me. I also don't get many vacation days from my work and I'm not sure i want to use my very few days for this, especially since I've already used 5 to go on vacation with them in the summer. Beyond all that it doesn't sound like the safest place. 

Am i being difficult or is it nuts to expect me to make this work? I know DH really wants to go and i don't want this to become a big fight like it usually does when Coprolite has her brilliant ideas."
951,"So today I decided to take DS (3yr) and DD (5 week) for a walk to my JYMums for something to do, it’s about a 20/30 minute walk depending on how much dawdling DS does.

We have to walk past SS’s house on the way and DS has recently started saying “Granddad, want to go to Granddad” every time we drive by because he remembers their front yard. So as we walked past DS decided he would bolt up their driveway and before I could catch him he knocked on their front door saying “Granddad! Want Granddad”

So here I am with DD strapped to the front of me, trying to think if I can just grab DS and run before they answer the door when he knocks again 🤦🏻‍♀️! Well luck was on our side and no one answered but I could hear shuffling around (it’s school holidays and SS doesn’t work) so I tell DS that we will come back later when Granddad is home from work. 

*side note that is relevant OH ended up sending his Dad a message asking him to pass along a Happy Birthday to SS because as he says, he loves her because she is his mum but that doesn’t mean he has to like her*

We finally sit down for tea tonight when OH gets a message from his Dad that SS sent.

“Thanks for the birthday txt and I love you and I want to sort things out so we can all be in touch more and thank Throwaway for coming over 2YSIL said she saw her leaving the driveway today”

OH just shook his head and said “I know her little game, I’m not playing it, she is the only one still carrying on because she hasn’t been told she is right. No one else is carrying on or cares anymore, if she really wanted to be in touch more she would have gotten 2YSIL to call out before you left the driveway, if she really cared and wanted to see her grandchildren she had an opportunity there and then to show it but she didn’t” he didn’t bother replying and doesn’t intend too.

Seriously the gall of this woman 🙄"
952,"So we visited my SO's mom today, and again she was her usual self with the snarky and condescending remarks about me but at this point I just shrug it off, whatever. She only does this when we're alone and BF is in another room with either his siblings or with the dog. 

Then she offered us all coffee, I politely declined due to the past experiences with her putting salt in it etc. Of course she got upset and gave an Oscar worthy performance of feeling betrayed and hurt that I think I'm ""too good for eating/drinking at her house"".

This is when FIL comes in. He's actually a really good man, he knows MIL hates me and if he is at home when we visit, which is unfortunately rare, he's always nice to me. He asked me what was wrong and I told him about the incidents when MIL gave me rotten/spoiled food and he was SHOCKED. He confronted MIL about it, eventually she did admit that it was on purpose.

FIL apologized profusely, BF was in shock about what his mother did and he apologized to me as well, and had a fight with his mom about it.

We left, MIL of course didn't apologize and even had the audicity to get mad at me for causing a scene. After we got home BF promised we won't visit his mom after this, only his siblings and stepdad at a café or anywhere but his mom's house."
953,"First post, new user, and I'm a scientist not an English major.  Please treat me kindly.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

I married my D(ear)H(ubby) a little over a year ago, and my MIL has been great so far.  We just bought our first home this year, adopted a pup, and I just received a full time job with good benefits.  His sister (SIL1) was engaged shortly after us, married the year before us (a choice I made just to keep the drama down), and just had their first child (Darling Niece) who is also the first grandchild.

&amp;#x200B;

Meat and Potatoes:

During SIL1's pregnancy, MIL kept asking if the DN would have blonde hair (DH, SIL1, and SIL2 are all blonde)  and I responded with, ""I don't know.  It depends if SIL's Husband has any blonde genes in his family, and if so it's about a 1 in 4 chance otherwise the kid will carry the gene.""  She then turns around and asks if any kid DH and I would have would be a red head or blonde (I'm a natural red head).  I respond, ""Probably strawberry blonde because of some recessive co-dominance going on.""  SIL1's baby shower comes, and I get asked again about the hair color and genetics except when I finish with my analysis of DN she comments ""I hope DN has fair hair.""  Then she asks when DH and I are thinking of trying, and I respond with, ""Well we just adopted a puppy that needs to be trained so not for at least a year.""

I being a little weirded out, tell DH that MIL's talk of wanting a fair haired grandkid before the first is even here is kinda stressing me out since she's doing this in front of my mother at SIL's baby shower.  DH takes it upon himself to let her know that it is stressing me out, and please don't mention it in front of me.

All goes quiet until just last week, nearly a month after DN arrives as blonde.  Well, nearly a month in DN's hair is starting to darken, and while visiting SIL makes the comment that MIL thinks that we'll be announcing a pregnancy soon.  (I have put on some stress weight, under 5lbs, due to the new job, and I have a naturally husky build.)  I told SIL that I don't even qualify for FMLA until late next year and we're even attempting until then, not to mention DH won't finish his master's until the following spring.  SIL acknowledges that we have a good plan, and we leave shortly after.

TL:DR MIL seems to want a fair haired grandkid, and with 1 month old DN's hair darkening, the comments and certainty that I'm preggo seems to be starting.

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to clarify D(ear)H(usband)."
954,"Hi! 

Little backstory: Married 10 years, 4 kiddos, always had a JNMIL. DH is good about acknowledging how nuts she is but chooses to leave texting open/unblocked. Me and the kids have been NC since June and DH has been VLC. She bounces back and forth between texts that act like nothing has happened, to begging to have contact, to the real crazy shit where she says that the kids and DH wouldn't be alive without her and she has a right to them (I could maybe see that argument to a certain point, but DH is adopted). DH doesn't reply and only shows me the really crazy texts and we have a laugh about it. 

So, yesterday we are enjoying a family day with friends. She starts this long sob story via text about wanting to see the kids and to at least send pictures if she isn't allowed to see them in person. (I put my food down with any contact because I don't trust her at all when it comes to my kids)  DH ignored it until we sat down for lunch and she started getting rude and demanding so DH felt like having fun and pissing her off. So he sent pics of his sandwich, soda and the top of the table saying ""here's your pics!"" We had a laugh and finished the afternoon hanging out as a family. 

That night a whole barrage of texts come through running the full spectrum of her crazy. I wanted DH to put his foot down and say there will not be pictures and to stop asking. He didn't want to stir the pot. I wanted her to know that she is not trusted even with pictures of the kids. And now I don't want to nag but I'd like him to tell her there will be no pictures and she has made her own bed.

Should I push the issue with DH or tell her myself or leave the whole thing alone?"
955,"Looking for some advice with some new developments. We agreed to Mediation with NMum and EDad for November to state our case on Grandparents Rights.

Previously, they have had access to my bio-Son on several occasions over the past few months via bio-Mum. With Mediation booked I figured this access might cease until a decision and arrangements are made, however I've found out on changeover today that NMum and eDad spent a few hours with my bio-Son at a play centre yesterday. They picked him up from bio-Mum, took him out for several hours, had lunch and dropped him back.

Do you think we should still go ahead with Mediation? The entire point of this Mediation is to resolve access rights, which they clearly have via bio-Mum. They've seen him twice in a month, I have the dates and activities involved.

Or, go ahead with Mediation and still bring all of this up and prove to the Mediator they have access and why the hell are we doing this? I'm very close to calling the Mediator and pulling out, as it's all voluntary and nothing is enforceable.

My small concern though is they'll still receive a no resolution certificate and take it to court. What they don't seem to realise is they are basically shooting themselves in the foot by continuing to do as they please, or as far as I'm concerned anyway.

Thoughts? Thanks all."
956,"**TL;DR -** My MIL is the most overbearing person I have ever met before, who thinks she's always right and everyone else is wrong.

**Back Story:** 

MIL &amp; FIL visiting from another country for 6 months to take care of their grandchild (not my child). Participants in this story are: me, my husband (hubby), my MIL &amp; FIL, my husband's brother (BIL), his wife (SIL)  and their kid. 

**Here goes..**

MIL despises SIL for some reason. I mean SIL isn't perfect, but like everything she does is wrong / bad / horrible. She doesn't raise her kid right, she doesn't know how to cook right, she doesn't know how to decorate their house, she sleeps too much, she doesn't do anything in the house, she's lazy, she's fat (MIL isn't going to win any fitness competitions either), she's stupid and the list goes on and on and on. 

MIL agreed to come to provide childcare so that kid doesn't have to go to daycare (daycare options are very limited where we live and the kid is still on a long waitlist) but now she is annoyed that she has to take care of the kid (I mean what did she expect when she agreed to this?). Kid apparently doesn't eat enough, doesn't behave herself properly (she's just over 1 years old, btw). Her kids behaved better, ate better, were talking / walking and doing all kinds of stuff by this age apparently. SIL &amp; BIL are trying to get kid to learn to eat by herself to improve her hand-eye coordination, but because she drops the food (because remember, she's A BABY), the kid is making too much of a mess. Apparently kid should be potty trained by now even though she's only a little over 1 and according to my first Google search, potty training starts at 18 - 24 months and can take up to 3 years. Apparently, she raised her kids so perfectly, which is why neither of them can cook anything more than an egg even though they have lived alone for several years. She used to force feed her kids until they threw up and then fed them more food because they threw up the food she just fed them (such excellent parenting right?). 

MIL hates staying with BIL &amp; SIL so every single chance they get, they come stay with me and hubby. My weekends are just spent entertaining them now. They've been here for 2 months already and at 1+ month of that time was spent living with us (even though they came to take care of their grandchild who does not live with me and my husband). MIL and FIL almost sulk when they have to leave our place. MIL was complaining that BIL &amp; SIL ""leave"" the kid with her and FIL and go off and have fun and don't bother to call to check up on the kid. ""They don't care about the kid, instead it's up to me to call them to ask when they're coming home"". It was my SIL's birthday, and they were just spending an evening with their friends...

When she's at our place, she feels the need to advise me / correct me and be just generally nosy. She went through my entire kitchen and rearranged my things while I was at work. She tries to force me to eat and when I say no multiple times, she either physically forces the food on my plate / in my mouth or just gives me a dirty look (apparently I'm too skinny... I should gain weight - but of course not enough to get fat like my SIL). She laughed at the fact that I fit into size XS and S clothing. She complained to MY mom about the fact that I don't eat enough, and then my mom became worried.

She doesn't like it because I like to clean up a bit before I sit down to eat dinner - to the point where she almost raises her voice commanding me to sit down and eat). I end up having to do all the cleaning after dinner, so I'd like to get some of it out of my way before sitting down to eat. I'm not stopping anyone else from eating. 

When making bread (which we make regularly at home), she commented that the brand of flour I use is very bad and that I should use a different brand  (before even trying it). Next time I needed to buy flour, I picked up a bag of the brand she liked. She first commented that the bag was too big ""Why would you buy such a big bag??"" (1. I use it regularly and will finish it before it goes bad, 2. buy in bulk and save $$$). Then she said ""actually the brand you bought before was good, why did you buy this brand?"" 

She constantly complains that the rice I have is too sticky / starchy, but never listens to me when I tell her to put less water when cooking it (assuming that she knows better than some kid who doesn't know how to cook). It's happened three times already where I tell her not to put so much water, she says she knows better, and then it ends up sticky, and then she says ""I should have put less water"" and then it repeats again.

She laughs at the fact that me and my husband have a low tolerance on spice. When we had guests over, she insisted on cooking and I spent the entire dinner topping up people's water glasses because their mouths were on fire. It's clearly not just us that have a low spice tolerance!

She will make a mess in the kitchen (drops something on the counter, which spills on the base cabinets and then on the floor). I will rush to get a wet cloth to wipe up and start wiping up the counter, when she points to the floor and commands me to ""wipe the floor"". I mean, I'm wiping the counter now, so like I will wipe the cabinets and floors once I'm done this. I haven't given her a reason to doubt my cleaning ability because I clean the kitchen top to bottom every single day after every single meal. So I don't see why she still needs to command me to do things as if I'm a child. In fact, I CLEAN BETTER THAN HER. She will so often wipe the counters (unbeknownst to me) and then when I go over it because I notice particles of food on it, she will comment saying that she already went over the counters so I don't need to do it, but like she can't clean properly because she doesn't have the best eyesight and can't see the particles).

Speaking of me being a child, apparently I'm too kiddish and a ""playmate"" for her grandchild. It's become a joke. Because I'm ""skinny"" (not true, I'm petite but not scrawny) and wear ""small clothes"", I look like a kid. Because kids like me and like to talk to me, I'm one of the kids instead of an adult capable of making my own decisions. She comments that when I drive, it looks like a kid driving a toy car. My favourite meal is something I've enjoyed since I was a young child. Typically this meal is the first kind of solid food introduced to a baby. It can be eaten as an adult as well, just with more spices and salt added to it to give it more flavour for an adult. She jokingly commented about how I eat baby food to a large group of people. I enjoy the food because it's comforting to me as it's something my mom used to make for me. 

I'm terrified of having children because I'm terrified she will insult them like how she insults my niece / her granddaughter. I'm also terrified because my parenting skills will be under a microscope. She so far likes me (especially more than my SIL / her other DIL) but I don't know how long that will last. I force myself not to sleep in on weekends (which is the only days I can sleep in) because I don't want to be dubbed ""lazy"" and that I sleep too much (which as I said before is what she constantly complains about from my SIL). I can't go out, or else she may say that I am abandoning them to be by themselves. Her constant complaining about my SIL is getting too much because what if she's saying similar things about me behind my back to them? 

 I think she means well (at least that's what my husband says, but IDK). According to my husband, this is just her personality - that she's always been a bit harsh / rough around the edges. I grew up with a mom who was nice and spoke in a soft tone (rather than a screeching banshee tone). Don't get me wrong, mom would know when to put us in our places when we were being little bitches, but she generally sounds NICE and acts NICE. I'm not used to this and I'm going crazy. 

I'm sure there's more, but after clicking on the keyboard for nearly 45 minutes, this is all I can remember."
957,"Garbanzo is my FIL's GF.  DH and I live with FIL (who is also very JN).  Garbanzo has been coming over basically every weekend since they started dating and has had me tearing my hair out for most of it.  I just don't know what to do with her to make her happy.  At first I tried  to be nice and hang out around them, but she mostly just wanted to hang out with FIL doing woodworking in the garage or watching TV in his bedroom.  Also refusing to eat most dinners I made.  She then straight up started ignoring DH and me when we'd go say hi when she showed up.  


In a previous post, I mentioned how she wrecked my cast iron, so I hid it from her after I fixed it.  Well, she also managed to burn a wooden spoon, melt a spoon rest, melt a spatula, and put kitchen things where they logically do not go.  The amount of times I have had to tear apart the kitchen trying to find something like a basting brush and finding it in the oven...wowza.


She apparently felt bad enough about melting the spatula that she got us a new one.  But she put it underneath our casserole dishes.  I only found it because I was getting out a casserole dish.  She didn't tell DH or me she got a new one.  I moved it into the drawer with the spatulas and spoons, not realizing I was supposed to thank her or leave it where she put it, since I didn't know she bought it, and I hadn't realized she melted the other one that looked just like the new one she got.


Garbanzo then tracked down DH crying when he was trying to leave for work saying I must have thrown it out and she felt uncomfortable being at the house if I was going to be an asshole.  He went and showed her that it was in the drawer it should be in, and all I did was put it somewhere I'd look for it.  In the house I live in, in the kitchen that I use almost every day.  More crying about how that's not where she put it and she didn't want to come over anymore if I'm going to continue being so rude.


Garbanzo, you are the one who started refusing to talk to me.  You are the one messing up my kitchen.  You refuse to eat food I purposely made vegetarian so you'd eat it.  Mostly, YOU DON'T LIVE HERE!  I can definitely be a bitch, but I don't see how putting things in their proper place in my kitchen is a problem worth crying about and calling me names.  Maybe don't destroy things in the first place?  Now FIL is mad Garbanzo doesn't want to come over anymore and DH is mad I even moved the stupid thing because I hardly ever use spatulas.



Ugh, do I even try and apologize?  I don't know how a cooking implement caused such a meltdown (har har).


UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who commented.  I promise I read them all, even though I didn't get to most of them...it's been a helluva week and not because of Garbanzo (it will be on JNFIL soon).  I'm glad to know IAMNTA and will take all suggestions to heart.  Garbanzo isn't here this weekend because she took a trip to see her grandkids, and next weekend we're all going to a family wedding (and DH's JNFamily might actually back me up that I'm not being the bitch here), so no showdown at the OK Corral yet."
958,"I have had a few posts about my mil wanting us to just borrow sil baby stuff when i was under rhe impression it was going to be gifted. Dh didnt understand my view but he still talked to mil about the highchair. She said, paraphrasing of course, that they we lending it to us with the understanding that it would be used and wear and tear or even damage wouldnt be held against us. I dont know if the borrowing clothes were brought up. Eitherway dh told mil that it made us uncomfortable (not sure if he really said us or just me but idgaf) and that the highchair would be best at sil house. So we arw returning the highchair and buying a new one. I took a couple things away from this

1. Dh doesnt understand my view but supported this choice so he gets points. I know this still frustrates him but he kept his word and said since it wasnt gifted we would be sending it back. 
2. Mil would rather keep ownership of something that isnt gonna be used than actually gift us something we can call our own. Just saying.
3. Mil appears to still be the high matriarch of their clan as dh didnt talk to sil who actually owns the stuff. Sil will have a chance to speak up when dh returns the chair. Either way, she is not my matriarch, i am empress of this family.

I know it sounds so superficial but i really saw this as a power play. That mil wanted control over what we used and how we used it. Well, i got a highchair in my amazom shopping cart and the 5 year old one she ""lent"" us is by the door ready to go."
959,"Bare with me, on mobile. I'll also be keeping it relatively vague in terms of something's just because I don't want to be identified. Please also bare with me on the fact I may be in a fog, I'm not entirely sure.

So recently my boyfriend and I have been going through the process of buying a house. We are very close to our closing date. We're both first time home owners and are incredibly excited to be moving out on our own and settling into the next stage of our relationship. SO and I have been living together at my parents for almost 3 years. It's been decent as my mom is very JY and my boarder line JNstep dad isn't around much. 

My in laws for the most part are great. FIL has his moments where he over steps, but when told will take a step back and half assed apologize. It's a lot better than where we were with him a couple years ago so I'll take it. MIL has always been warm and welcoming to me since day one. We aren't best friends but it's nothing to sit at their house for the afternoon and chat while SO and FIL work outside. I do think very highly of both MIL and FIL.

However, I'm unsure if I've just spent too much time on here and am looking for an issue, or if I have valid red flags popping up. When we told FIL we made an offer on a house his reaction was less than stellar. In fact, I bawled my eyes out and it took a lot of excitement from me. Later in the week he apologized, and told us he was acting out of fear for us but that he didn't know where we stand financially so he shouldn't have said what he did, and that he was very proud of us. He hasn't stopped asking if we need help packing, or how it's going with the lawyer, ect., he's now trying to be as helpful as possible, but staying out of way when needed. 

MIL, on the other hand has hardly said anything. No congratulations, no I'm happy for you guys, nothing of the sorts. I've seen her twice in the last 2 weeks and she asked ""what was new besides the obvious"" and that's all she's said to me about the house. And even though yesterday was a normal afternoon of hanging out with her, but in 3 hours she barely said anything, even though we have some really big things happening with the house this week. It's also been radio silence from her on SO's end too. If he hears from her it has nothing to do with the house. She's not being rude, per se. She'll talk to me if she needs to, and she still seems fine with SO. It's just no reaction whatsoever.

Her complete lack of reaction has me very on edge and I can feel the walls going up. I'm really not sure what to think and while I'm hoping that maybe she's just not sure what to say about it, I know it's not uncommon for some MILs to bring out the crazy when it's become clear that the girlfriend isn't temporary. Am I overreacting, or is there actual red flags popping up that I should be weary of?"
960,"Hi everyone,  I really just need to vent and need a bit of advice about my JNMom. I feel like I need to provide a lot of background info, so sorry if this is long.  

We are from Eastern Europe, now living in Canada. Essentially during the collapse of USSR my mom had to radically change her career choices and work extremely hard to get money in order for our family to have a financially comfortable life. I think because she was so focused on the monetary aspect of life for so long, she is not a good parent when it comes to emotional support or needs of other people. Her way is the only right way, and if I disagree she will not shut up about it. For example: when I was 17 i started taking birth control pills, and then about 6 months later I got pretty bad eczema on my hands. My mom was convinced that those 2 events were related, so she proceeded to tell me to stop taking the birth control EVERY. TIME. WE. TALKED. Didn't matter that 2 different doctors told her it was not related, didn't matter that I switched the pills brand a few times and my eczema didn't improve, didn't matter that I told her over and over and over to stop talking about it.

My mom is also a gold digger. She essentially hides her finances from men she is with, and gets them to buy her anything and everything she can get away with. 

I recently got married to my D(ear)H, a man with whom I have been for 5 years, and lived with for 4. We both have some mental health issues, he has pretty severe depression and has had troubles with keeping a job in the past because of it (essentially, he hated the job to the point of his depression worsening dramatically, so he could not continue to work there).   
During 1st year of our relationship, my mom ""joked"" that I will find somebody richer once I move to a different city and go to university. At the end of 2nd year, she told me I should ""reconsider our relationship"" because he is ""manipulating me"" and i should be with someone that can financially support me more. After 3 years, I went to therapy because she was too much, and put her on progressively more restrictive info diet. After 4 years, when I told her we are getting married, her reply was ""Oh, how come? What happened?""And then a week later she told me ""I think you should postpone the wedding and think about it some more"". Essentially she has an issue with us splitting all expenses 50/50, and told me I should not work so hard, and I should hide my competencies from him, that all men are lazy and that if I work too hard he will just work less and less and eventually i will be stuck with supporting an entire family by myself. This kind of broke me, and I had to once again reconsider how much info she should get from me. She got an ultimatum of ""either you come to the wedding and be happy for us, or you are not welcome there"".

We got married a year later, in the same month as our 5th anniversary of being together. I had not seen her in person for 2.5 years prior to this (only skype and phone calls), and she was trying so very hard to make our very small and very informal wedding more ""wedding-like"". She was told multiple times that ""this is my wedding and it's gonna be what I want, and not what you want"", but her presence there was just not pleasant. The whole thing thing was organized by my ILs, and they were wonderful and attentive to our wishes. My mom spent her time trying to commandeer people into moving things around to how she liked it best, and she kept dropping criticizing remarks to me in our language the whole time - ""why aren't you wearing more make up"", ""why isn't the groom wearing a suit"", ""what kind of wedding food is BBQ'd meats and potato salads"", ""you should be wearing a different colour"" etc, etc. 

So now she is on a VERY restricted info diet,  and I am maintaining VLC with her - she calls, i don't pick up. She texts, I reply with ""everything is fine"" and do not reply to any texts after that. Essentially i am just letting her know that I am not dead, and that's it. 

To be quite honest, it feels wonderful. I am taking a stance here and finally giving her nothing from my life.   
But. I really try to be a nice person. I have a lot of empathy, I have a lot of emotion, and on some level this is really hard for me. She writes me about my grandma (that still lives in Easter Europe), she texts like she is really worried when I don't reply. How do people deal with this stuff? I know I am certain I do not want more contact with her, but should I at least have explained WHY I went VLC with her? I kind of feel that I never really told her exactly what she has done to deserve this, and I just feel kind of guilty? I know that if I give her more space in my life the cycle will repeat and she will hurt me again, so how do I deal with the guilt of shutting her out?"
961,"TLDR: My MIL set her sights on a new member of her family, so we're in the clear! Meanwhile, I'm a little conflicted (but overall, very happy). 

Hi, my MIL decided to not acknowledge DH and I's firstborn son was her grandchild because we used a sperm donor. This lead to us becoming estranged and we decided to hide that our LO2 was naturally conceived. And by that I mean, we just didn't mention how LO2 ""came to be"". People just came to the same conclusion as last time. We also decided to move away from DH's extended family, which meant we also had to move further away from mine.

So, biggest update, I've recently had LO2. Me and DH now have two boys. It's been a wonderful/ stressful time. Between this and the very quick move, I feel like I could sleep through to next year. Sadly, no time. My DH is doing the heavy lifting right now, but it was a real struggle for us to get everything ready before LO2 was born- and we're still trying to get things sorted. Living within a city has been a big adjustment from before, but in a weird way I feel much safer. It'd be much harder for Donna to come to our house unannounced here, and not get noticed, if she ever had the idea.

In MIL-related news, she is very happily distracted by news of a new baby. Not our baby, who she is also choosing to not acknowledge as related to her, but my SIL's new baby. That's right, my SIL (DH' sister) has announced her and her husband are going to have a child sometime in the next year.

I always thought SIL was very firm about never wanting kids, so this is very sudden to me. Whenever I would bring up pregnancy, or wanting kids, she would always say ""better you than me"". Not in an unfriendly way, but I got the impression it wasn't something she wanted for herself. My MIL wasn't a fan of the ""live and let live"" mindset, so she would tell her ""It's different when it's *your* baby!"" or ""When *you* have a baby, *you'll* understand!"" In retrospect, I feel very bad for not calling her out at the time. 

SIL, her husband, my DH and I still see each other- though not at our new house and not very often. We tend to go to a place about half an our's drive away, while my parents make the drive over to watch DS. SIL and her husband seemed pretty happy when they announced the big news, but I can see the cracks forming.

MIL is coming to stay with them. This is not optional, which they said was fine to ""keep the peace"". I asked how long she'd be staying: at least a month. *At least*. I think I'd go crazy if my own mum (who is very respectful of boundaries) decided to stay with me for a month while I was adjusting to a new baby. Also, baby names. Donna has given a selection of baby names she would deem ""acceptable""- and all of them are family names (big surprise). She's bought them items for their upcoming baby, while they still haven't bought anything.

My SIL and her husband were very good about not quoting her directly, my DH's brother, not so much. He's got his own problems. His soon to be ex-wife is divorcing him and is refusing any contact with his extended family. She moved out about a week after they made the announcement, their house is now up for sale and she's apparently asking them to take a huge ""financial hit"" so they can get divorced as soon as possible. (I'm not sure what BIL means by this, or even how true that is, but he's been ranting about it nonstop to anyone who will pretend to listen.) I say, good for her. Donna, of course, is calling her every name under the sun, implying she was unfaithful (how would she know?) and generally trying to turn everyone she knows against her. I'm glad my soon to be ex-SIL is far away from the action. I'm also kind of glad Donna has another target to hate, as bad as that is.  

DH and I have a very strict ""as soon as you start passing on messages from Donna to us, we hang up"" rule with BIL, which we have had to enforce a few times before he realised we were serious. However, I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing when he mentions how ""happy MIL is now she's finally getting a grandchild!"" and how she ""can't wait to babysit her grandchild when the parents go back to work! Nurseries are so bad for young children!"" We used a mix of my parents and nursery when we decided DH was old enough. He seems fine, but hey, what would I know? We don't react when he tells us this over the phone and he moves on pretty quickly to whatever new drama is happening in his life before we say our goodbyes.

Me and DH are currently trying to decide where to go now we know our sons will have a new little cousin in their life. Yes, we want them to interact, but we also know who the favourite grandchild is going to be- and I will not tolerate that. Never. My DH wants to establish a rule of ""No Donna talk allowed"" when we visit them, or they visit us, but I don't think that's realistic. Donna is going to be staying at their house for at least a month, maybe longer. She is going to demand they give her every opportunity they can to babysit their LO. That child is going to know my MIL very well- how could we hide her from our children? At the same time, we don't want our children to be completely isolated from DH's side of the family. 

So my questions are: is it bad that I'm kind of glad Donna has two new victims that aren't us? Should we limit our interactions with SIL, her husband and their new LO so our children won't have to know about Donna? Is it possible for my children to have a healthy relationship with their cousin when it's obvious they're not the favourite grandchild?"
962,"Last week I got wonderful advice on this sub about my mother-in-law. Now it's my own mother (my wife's MIL) who is the issue. I'm writing on behalf of both of us. We share this problem.

&amp;nbsp;

My (35 M) mother and father currently live 1.5 hours' drive from us, but my mother wants to move to our neighborhood later this year. We are planning to have children, and my mother wants to be a big part of their lives. 

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is that I have a somewhat toxic relationship with my mother. She is fundamentally a good and kind person, but we got along like snakes and weasels when I was growing up. We've been getting along well for the last 5+ years, but this is probably because we don't talk much. I see her once a month at most and keep in touch with short, cordial emails. The winning formula is ""distance + cordiality,"" basically. 

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of the old toxicity remains in the atmosphere, however, and my mother can be difficult to take. Example: Like many Boomers, her fixation on shout-talking angry, resentful Fox News talking-points (to her unsympathetic Millennial kin) can take on an aggressive, unsettling quality. We have asked her *many* times not to discuss politics with us, but she seems to feel that the ""kids"" have no right to tell her what she can and cannot discuss. (As she wrote to me: ""I refuse to walk on eggshells around you."") So simply having lunch with my mother sometimes involves--as it did earlier this afternoon--listening to creepy rants about how Hillary Clinton has had many lesbian affairs, how AOC's followers want to eat babies... you get the picture, and you likely have a MIL like this yourself if you're in your 30s and living anywhere in the USA. 

&amp;nbsp;

I should mention that we also have a lot of lovely time together, often during the very same visits. We've become so accustomed to arguing over the years that arguments can burn out quickly and smoothly, with no lingering sting of surprise or unease. Nasty political rants give way to fond sympathies and delightful conversations about day-to-day things we can all relate to together (dogs, the crazy prices in our big city, more dogs, and so on). 

&amp;nbsp;

Beyond the occasional ""social toxicity"" and awkwardness, however, there is my mother's insistent way of foisting her opinions on others and mocking those who fail to heed her wisdom. She very frequently critiques the way my NY-based brother and his wife raise their beautiful child, despite the fact that they seem like terrific parents. My mother's satires of bourgie NYC parenting can be extremely witty and trenchant, but the main word that comes to mind is ""petty."" I don't want that kind of sharp edge directed at me and my wife, and neither does my wife. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even if my mother was willing to change her behavior, though, the fact remains that being around her makes me feel angry, tense, and anxious, much as I love her. The thought of her moving to my neighborhood is even a bit scary to me. I lose sleep over it and become depressed thinking about a future with her right down the street. 

&amp;nbsp;

She's a grown woman and she'll move where she wants, of course. I can't stop her. But how do I tell her *I just don't want her living nearby?*

&amp;nbsp;


Is there any way to tell her without seeming utterly cruel? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: MIL wants to move to our neighborhood; we vote ""nay."""
963,"I didn’t go into labor but MIL still managed to make the day as stressful as she possibly could. She shows up at our house  4 hours early and while I’m preparing stuff for the party in another room by myself. She follows me into the room and literally corners me where she starts questioning my pregnancy. “How far are you dilated, why hasn’t he dropped yet, when’s your next prenatal appointment?”  Like always, I just nonchalantly answer “I don’t know” to everything.  I tell her I’m pretty sure we’ve estimated my due date wrong in a sad attempt to throw her off the actual due date so she demands to know when I think it will be. “So will it be October or November? When?” She’s like some rabid animal over this baby. Again, I just shrug and busy myself with getting ready for the party. I was determined not to allow her to stress me out. DH  swoops in at this point and changes the subject. He announces that we’re looking at houses in cities on the other side of the country, several hours away from MIL. Yay!! I did not expect him to tell her yet.  This has been a huge secret and we knew she’d blow up when she found out. It was such a beautiful display of his new and improved shiny spine and the perfect way to distract her from new baby. He was so anxious about telling MIL and FIL  and I’m so proud of him. Her reaction and that whole story are too long to go into at the moment but it made the rest of the day so tense that I avoided her as much as possible. Even though it was tense I’m so glad he told her. It’s a huge step in the right direction. 

Thanks so much for all your wonderful advice and support."
964,"We moved into our first house last week and my MIL has been to visit almost every day - eek! 

The strange thing is though: she always goes to the back door of the house?! To make things even worse, she tries to open the door without knocking, doesn’t call to say she is visiting and then proceeds to shout “HELLO?!” At the top of her voice and keep banging on the door until I open it.

I have told her time and time again that I would prefer her to use the front door; to call first, and to use the doorbell but she refuses. 

Today she visited with SIL (when in her presence she seems to have more confidence and doesn’t fear upsetting me). As always, they went to the back, shouted and banged until I opened it and just barged past me - didn’t ask: “can we come in?” I was feeding my 9 month old daughter to understandably it took me a long time to get to the door.

When I told them both that I wasn’t expecting them, they should use the front door etc. I was told that it’s bad luck to use the front door in a house if you are a family member?! MIL also said I should leave the doors unlocked so she can let herself in - I politely told her no, as then anybody can let themselves in!

How do I deal with this?"
965,"My little girl finally arrived yesterday! It was one of the best moment of my life even though it left me feeling absolutely atrocious physically. Mentally I’m on cloud nine and I’m basically a child at the aquarium when she’s sleeping. We have her in our room in this clear plastic crib they provided and my goodness I can’t stop staring or wanting to hold her. We haven’t settled on an adoption family just yet so we are taking her home with us for the time being. We know that risks falling in love with her more (which seems impossible seeing as how we are right now but hey) we accept that though and are just wanting to do what’s best.

Now onto the in-laws and family.

So my SO agreed not to tell his family until we were settled in the post party (haha) room. However things changed when he saw her - it was like a light switched on in his head and he was so excited to hold her. Legitimately it made my heart do little flips watching him cuddle her and soothe her. He’s a natural with her and I have no doubt she’d be a daddy’s girl if she isn’t already (though she’s been really good with me too thank goodness haha). However SO was so excited he took a picture of our daughter and immediately sent it to his parents. At first I was a *little* upset since we only had to wait a little while longer (I wanted to wait as I didn’t want to have them try and bombard us with visits when I just pushed this *beautiful* mini watermelon out of me) but he explained how excited he was about her and I melted. His parents are very much JY most the time that I see them (if a little strange. His father is very.. stone wall but he has a soft and generous side even if he doesn’t talk much. His mother is a little crazier and has begun to display some of the more negative traits that one may find in a MIL turned grandma buuuuut so far she’s still very kind to me so no biggie).

Welp. Two minutes later as I’m holding our daughter my SO comments that his dad just posted a sweet message and a picture of our daughter to the book of faces. My stomach dropped. I told him immediately to ask him to take it down. It wasn’t so much that the message or picture was bad but we hadn’t even had a chance to tell family and friends in person let alone announce it ourselves online and I didn’t want people finding out second hand off a Facebook post. His father thankfully agreed but then kept asking when he could post about it. I understood he was excited so I simply replied that he was free to post when we made the announcement ourselves. Originally I wanted to do this in person but after the hectic ordeal at the hospital I agreed just to make a post on the book of faces and make plans with anyone who wanted to meet her from there so I wouldn’t have to feel overwhelmed. He kept pushing for it so I waited until we got down to our new room to post and simply added some of her details (first name, weight, time born. How much we love her haha. Nothing else though).

He reposted shortly after that a sweet message with the addition of her first name. Awesome. One trial over.

Then came his mother. She was waiting at the edge of her seat for me to give birth and was telling SO she would storm the hospital to meet our daughter right away. I told SO under no circumstances did I want her here right now and to not give her the password we have set on the room (which apparently doesn’t even work which is a major downfall of the hospital. SO left to go get food from the cafeteria- when he came back he told them my name, room number and the password and they just let him through *which was expected* BUT on his way past the desk he over heard them say on the phone “hey just asking does room #X have a password?” UM)

She didn’t like being told no by any means but accepted a visit to come in the next couple weeks upon my discretion of when I was ready (because I know by no means am I right now. OUCH). Either way crisis yet again diverted right? Right. Awesome.

Then out of the darkness comes the reason for this title. My family. Ugh.

I’d completely forgotten I still had family members on my book of faces. Thankfully my mother wasn’t a direct friend (I don’t think she has anything besides Instagram for stalking purposes and she’s blocked there too). But nonetheless my aunt saw the post and rather than text/call me or comment on the post she texted my mother asking about my baby. My mother immediately texted me saying so and telling me once again she “loved me” and wanted to “talk things out” because she wants a relationship with my daughter. I can’t tell you how fast my heart was racing. I practically screamed. I told SO to take our daughter while I did some crisis control.

I immediately tried to reach out to my aunt so I could at least try to see what info had been given to my mother if any (thankfully again I only posted the basics. No middle or last name, no hospital references even though my mother could make an educated guess - I never was able to change hospitals - etc etc but still I didn’t want my mother to know anything so her getting immediate knowledge plus the fact my aunt went to her and not to me made me panic).

I went about writing a simple message asking her not to share any (or any more) information with my mother. I simply stated I did not wish to have contact or a relationship with her and made sure to add that the reason was between her and myself (so no one can claim I was just trying to spread rumors. I’m not saying she did anything explicit. I’m not saying she did anything at all. No rumors to try to twist in her favor this way I think). I then reiterated that I do want to keep a relationship with the family (not really my aunt specifically but her two sons, my young cousins, I love to death and beyond so losing her would mean losing them; along with a handful of others I genuinely care about). I then slightly edited the message and copy/paste/sent it to the remaining family members as well as a few church members who have a decent friendship with myself as well as with my mother.

No one in my family outside my aunt #2 aka my mothers best friend responded. Aunt #2 said she completely would respect my wishes but I don’t know if I truly can any more. She hasn’t proven she would betray me by any means but I’m paranoid.. I guess anyone would be in this situation.. ugh.

I don’t know what else to do or if there is anything left needing to be *DONE*. Any tips or advice is welcome. Not sure how to handle this situation.. I just want my daughter safe from my psychopathic mother."
966,"Today my JNMIL told some family members she has an announcement... and then proceeded to literally say ‘DH is going to be a daddy’. No mention of me who was sitting right there. One family member actually said ok and OP is the mum right?!

EDIT 1: we live with the in-laws, I have done since we got married approx 5years ago. It’s up and down and DH is definitely in the FOG which I find hard to deal with 
I was fine with her making the announcement as it was to her brother and family who are really lovely. I just didn’t expect to be left out completely and made to just feel like the equipment incubating the baby or that somehow only DH was going to be a new parent and had managed to get pregnant by himself?!

EDIT 2: South Asian heritage, traditional inlaws... likely to be living here another two years due to financials. LO probably be 18m before we have a chance of moving out! Currently 6m pregnant

EDIT 3: DH is in the FOG and generally does not take a side although will listen to me vent and stay quiet. I was very upset over how she announced, as we miscarried two years ago and have been trying since, which she is also very aware of. He said he didn’t hear how she said it or notice anything!!!"
967,"It's been a while since I updated. The kids are fine. I could be better. No ambushes since the June ambush. I'm definitely on edge and expecting another ambush. I hate being so damn paranoid, but I have every reason to be. There were no warning signs before the ambush in June.                                         
           
There's a few things I could go over, but I'm going to stick to a recurring issue, unsolicited *gifts* with a catch.                 
                     
Since the ambush, Hag sent quite a few things.         
                
She sent DS1 a box of random souvenirs and a shirt for DuH from places she visited on her way back after her unsuccessful ambush. He asked Hag about the random little stuffed animal in the box, she said it's for DS1. So far, nothing for DS2.              
                                    
She sent a package containing matching outfits for DS1 and DS2 that say ""someone that actually loves me bought me this in (insert town here)!"" YES, THE SHIRTS ACTUALLY SAY THAT. In return for her ""gift"", she demanded DuH to send photos of the kids wearing the outfits. Don't worry, those outfits never made it on my kids. Surprisingly, DuH actually told me that he hates the outfits and that the slogan is offensive. Insert the Nicholas Cage meme that says ""you don't say?""               
                                              
In typical DuH fashion, he didn't return the outfits. Why?  *""because it would be rude to return a gift!""* Bitch please, those outfits were rude to send! Even moreso to expect us to force our children to wear those scratchy repugnant outfits and force them to pose for photos just so she can post the photos on social media and play grandma/mother of the year.                                  
                     
After sending the outfits, she sent another package for DS1. Other than the matching outfit, DS2 got nothing. Shocker, STILL not even being discreet about who the GC is. DuH used to be vocal about it until they said ""We don't send him anything because we don't have a relationship with him."" They don't have a relationship with DS1 either, but that doesn't stop them from sending him tons of unsolicited ""gifts"" all the time. That will make DS2 feel so special when he's old enough to realize what's happening!                                            
                                            
For DS1's birthday, she sent a large amount of money and more toys. I have a feeling that DuH asked her to send DS1 the money, but I'm nowhere near ready to spill the tea on justnoso. He told me that Hag offered to pay for a big ticket item DS1 needs, but I don't believe him.     
                      
Also, it's pretty fishy that two people with no income can roll around in a 60k+ gas guzzling truck across the country and back plus up and down the coast and throw thousands of dollars at DuH and DS1.       
        
Oh, because I suck and didn't finish the post before posting, I forgot to mention the most recent package for DuH from the in-laws, a single father parenting book!    
          
     
Edit: not to sound mean, but my flair literally says **NO ADVICE WANTED.** It's a boundary. Please respect that. Don't be like Hag and stomp on a boundary."
968,"So DH had a bad fall yesterday and we ended up at the local ER. Since his doctors are located in the same town as MIL, we decided to take him in first thing tomorrow in the hopes they can see him since there are a lot of issues and questions associated with his health issues. We were just going to leave super early tomorrow morning, but MIL lost her damn mind when she found out DH fell and demanded we come today and stay with her so she can ""take care of her baby"".

So we showed up this afternoon. DH hung out with his brother for a while and then came in and wanted to watch some game in the living room. I had been in the bedroom, pretending to read so I didn't have to talk to MIL, but DH asked if I wanted to watch the game with him. No, I didn't, but I was certain this was code for ""I'm already scared to death that I'm dying and now it might be quicker and with more issues than anticipated so will you please come sit with me and silently ease my mind"", so I decided to suck it up because I love my husband more than I hate football.

So DH sits on one end of the couch and I ask him if he wants a drink. He does, so I go into the kitchen to make him an ice water and me a sweet tea. When I walk back into the living room, MIL is now sitting inbetween the middle and other side of the couch, with 8 throw pillows around her so that there's no place for me to sit. Ok, whatever... You can sit next to him MIL, but he sleeps next to me. I end up in the arm chair across from them.

About 10 minutes into the game, DH is snoring with his arm and hand resting on a stack of throw pillows. Great. I can leave and go back to pretending to read before MIL decides to start talking to me. I go to stand up, but something catches my eye. MIL is holding hands with DH.

So I sit my fat happy ass back down and see just how long this goes on for.

The answer is 47 minutes, which is how long I was keeping time until DH woke up. At that point he moved his hand away from her and shot me a ""WTF"" look. I just smiled and got up to go to the bedroom.

When he came to bed I asked him how his date went and he asked me what the Hell happened. I told him he fell asleep and I noticed she was holding his hand. At one point, she was even rubbing the top of his hand, caressing it. He literally looked at me and said ""Ewww...""

I actually kinda feel a little sorry for MIL. DH is her oldest and she suffered a few miscarriages before him. She calls both of her kids miracle babies. This fall really has us concerned because it could mean a number of things, none of them good. The best thing we can hope for is it was just a fluke, that the heat got to DH, and it's not anything as worrisome as blockages in his legs or further issues with his heart.

Hopefully we'll have answers tomorrow."
969,"I want to preface this by saying my MIL is a very sweet and good-hearted woman. I do love her and she’s definitely not a JN, but I thought this sub would be a good place to ask for advice. 

I have a few problems with her, though. Firstly, she always spells my name wrong, even with reminders from me and SO. I have a very simple name, like under 4 letters. Secondly, every single time I see her, without fail, she tells me I look tired. It hurts my feelings a lot because I have very dark circles under my eyes naturally and I can’t get rid of them, so I’m self conscious about it. SO knows it bothers me but isn’t sure what do say because it’s technically so minor. 

She does general BEC things like insinuating herself into our plans or making weird comments, but those first two things make me feel like she doesn’t really respect me for some reason. Am I overreacting? How do I gently tell her she makes me uncomfortable saying I look tired all the time? Why does this bother me so much?

EDIT: thank you so much for all of your replies and advice. I feel well-armed with ways to confront her. For those of you saying she is a justno, not a good person, or that I should straight up fight with her over this, I’d like to remind you that you don’t know this woman and have only my small glimpse into a few of her ruder behaviors. Please respect that I do in fact love my MIL and she is otherwise a good person who has faults. Everyone has faults. I’m not defending her behavior, I’m just offering a reminder not to be so black and white about this. It hurts me to see strangers talking about her like that."
970,"Hello friends! This is an update, I’m the one whose MIL gave my DH an ultimatum of standing up for her to me or she wouldn’t visit LO, after she decided our hospital rules (the ones to keep our LO safe &amp; that we made together) shouldn’t apply to her because “i’m your mother!”. Monkey in the Middle (MitM) is what was decided for my MIL’s name, since she always complains to my DH that she “doesn’t have a place in our marriage”.  This is mostly a rant, advice is welcome but just know that complete NC isn’t an option, we’re young (about 20) just starting our lives together and DH isn’t ready to cut her off just yet. I KNOW he’ll get to NC on his own because of MitM’s actions sooner or later. 

I just wanted to share that I did have LO about over a month ago! After DH sent his message putting her in her place and she agreed to respect our “wishes” (they’re rules, bitch.) they didn’t speak for a few days. ***THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE***

MitM sent him some sad ass pictures of quotes about how worthless he made her feel. And then she blocked him on FB. One of our friends still had her on FB, so she sent us all the posts she made that were blatantly about us. They included “love your kids when they’re little because when they grow up they change.” EXCUSE ME?? How about you love your kids regardless because THEY’RE YOUR KIDS. It also included about 20 quotes about leaving toxic people alone and how people don’t want you to be happy because they aren’t happy. So MitM thinks we (probably more me) are the toxic ones, surprise surprise. 

So we got induced and had our precious LO with no drama or complications. We decided to invite them to come see LO because we know we would never hear the end of it if we didn’t let MitM see “her grandbabyyyy” after she was born. So DH texted MitM after the birth saying they could come visit after 5:30 (when we moved to recovery room). She replies “ok”. They arrive at 7:30. Proceed to make a huge deal about cleaning their hands in front of me. I was holding LO and asked JYMSFIL? wanted to hold LO. He replied that MitM did so sadly I handed LO off to her. She and JYMSFIL held LO.  I even let DH’s younger brothers, (6&amp;9yo i think?) hold LO, even though I didn’t want them to. I was polite and made small talk. The whole visit lasted 30ish minutes, wasn’t awful but it was awkward and I was pissed they even showed up after blocking him, acting like nothing was wrong. Like I promised, we had a Digital camera that we took picture on while they were visiting. They followed all the rules we set so that was a plus. I think DH’s message may have gotten through to her a little. 

So they leave. We take baby home, a few days pass. MitM messages DH asking is she can “share little-ones-name’s arrival with my friends?”. DH asks if she meant on FB? She says yes. We discuss and he replies “We both agree that’s fine. But we also both agree we should see when someone posts something about our LO. I noticed you blocked me on FB. You need to unblock me first. We’ll send you the pictures from the hospital visit.”  Her reply? “okay sweetie”. No apology (shocker), no excuse, no explanations nothing. He sends her the pictures. She unblocks him. 

Her posts on FB? The first is a status “we have great news! we’re grandparents!”. The other posts? Individual posts of each picture we sent her, (her and LO, JYMSFIL and LO, DH and his brothers and LO). Which pictures didn’t she post? Any of the ones with me in them. Then she stole a professional newborn picture off of DH’s FB and posted it with the caption “look”.  

So for one, there was not even one mention of me, the one who birthed LO. Two, there was not one single “congratulations DH &amp; OP!”. And three, there was no announcing LO’s arrival. MitM didn’t once mention LO’s name. She didn’t acknowledge anything besides the fact that she’s “now a grandma!”. It burns me up inside. She doesn’t care about LO, just how LO benefits her. She’s such a Narcissist. 

DH’s little brothers birthdays were about two weeks after LO’s arrival. She invited us to their parties. DH and I decided 2 weeks was too little to bring LO around that many children. So he went to the party while LO &amp; I stayed home and napped. 

MitM has not once tried to come visit LO. The only time they’ve seen LO was in the hospital. Instead of asking to visit she continues her bombarding  of “do you need anything?” messages to DH and gets upset when he replies no.

MitM recently told him that “it’d be nice if you all came over soon”. He replied we were waiting for LO to get bigger first.  
I just don’t understand why we have to go over there? It takes a lot to pack up a newborn and haul them somewhere. It makes much more sense for them to visit us. Like every other family member who wants to see LO has. 


Anyway, that’s my rant. For now we are just keeping LO safe and sound away from MitM’s reach. Although I know the visit there is coming soon, (for thanksgiving, if not sooner) which I am dreading. 


Read my first post to see how awful she really is!"
971,"First, thank you for all the comments and feedback on my last post. It really meant a lot to me to hear I'm on the right path. As silly as it might sound, I keep second-guessing myself and wondering if I had handled X differently, would we be where we are now. All your feedback really helped me stop the second-guessing.

I also wanted to put out something I forgot in my last post. I posted much earlier that I had found out my wife had consulted a divorce attorney at my MiL's insistence. It turns out she never actually went. My MiL had been hounding her relentlessly, and she finally agreed to take the card from her just to get her to stop the harassment. My wife told me about the card as we were talking about MiL's constant attempts to sabotage our marriage. That will teach me to take my information from the enemy (so to speak) - just because my MiL finally got my wife to take the card doesn't mean my wife actually went.

So here we are, a couple of days after MiL was sectioned. How much progress has she made, you might ask. Well, the answer would be none. MiL still insists she doesn't belong there, and the only reason she's there is because she hit me. She doesn't get the logic that when you hit people you get arrested, unless there's a serious mental illness involved. Then you are sectioned.

She still insists she's not mentally ill, and insists that the only mentally ill person is me. She takes certain nuggets of information out of context and tries to use them as evidence. In a group session she told them that I had been abused as a child (true), and that this is why I won't let her see my daughters. One person told her ""it sounds like he's reliving his childhood"", which she took to mean that they agreed I was mentally ill and that the only reason her hitting the girls (which she also still claims either didn't happen or happened long ago, and wasn't more than a swat on the butt) was a problem was that I was not able to handle my own childhood.

In addition, according to MiL, I'm still psychotic and dangerous, neurotic, paranoid, and not in touch with reality. She also thinks that I am so persuasive that I have managed to fool my wife, her brother, the psychiatrist we saw, multiple friends and relatives, school teachers, and who knows who else. All of them are under my spell, she's the only one that sees the truth.

My wife brought her clothes and some other things, and MiL berated and guilted her while she was there. My wife left her a fleece to stay warm. On my wife's next visit MiL was wearing it, and was commenting on why it was so big. My wife told her it was actually my fleece, and MiL got angry that my wife had not told her the fleece was mine.

So, in short, she's still blaming me for the problems in her life, still feels I'm severely mentally ill, still sees nothing wrong with what she did to our daughters (if she admits it at all), and is selectively taking comments of people who have not even met me as proof of my mental illness.

In a strange twist, MiL actually voluntarily signed to stay another 72 hours, so she won't be released Monday or Tuesday. There is the possibility of the psych unit setting up a session where I can come in and meet with them and MiL. I have no problem with this, as she will likely not be able to handle the meeting and break her act of innocent, wronged grandma.

I've talked with my wife several times about the restraining order, and she's never pushed back in the least. She's very frustrated that MiL hasn't made any progress whatsoever, and tells me ""I can't take a repeat of the last 15 months"". We also talked about some of the abuse my wife suffered at her mother's hands as a child. Some of it was horrific. Some of it she (perhaps purposely) has not really thought about. On hearing some of it I firmly believe that MiL not only abused her, but facilitated others abuse of my wife knowingly. My wife had never thought about that possibility.

She spoke critically of herself for ""being a wimp"" and not standing up to her mother. That she ""should have done this months ago"". I told her she's a victim here, and her mother has conditioned her to be compliant her entire life. I told her that it's easy to see she's terrified of her mother, and she didn't dispute it. I told her she could learn to stand up to her mother, but that it would take time, it just wouldn't happen overnight, and until then, I would bear the brunt of standing up to her. I'm going to try to gently persuade her to get therapy to learn to deal with her childhood, hopefully after all of this she'll be willing.

I also told her to think about how we should react if it was my mother or other close relative. What she'd think if they were talking about murdering her, hitting the kids, and all the other things we're experiencing at the hands of her mother, and she recognizes that she has to change the way she's thinking of what her mother is doing. This is great - progress, not perfection.

 I told her I'd wait to file the restraining order until we find out if the meeting is possible. If it is, I'll wait to file until then. If not, I'll file tomorrow. Why wait? Because I want that meeting. I want her to have to face her lies and exaggerations in front of the people taking care of her. I'm hoping she will lose control facing me - if she's going to lose it, I want it to happen there, in a safe place, in front of the professionals taking care of her."
972,"Now since they were not invited to my son’s birthday , they where ‘angry’ I suppose and guess what did they did ? The same thing I did , BIL daughter’s birthday was this weekend and finally I was not the only one who was not invited. My partner was left out too and thank God he opened his eyes.

He said we are one and they’ll have to accept our relationship and family or else the distance will be there for a very long time."
973,"DH talked MIL/BIL to come down to our little town for lunch. Which I am so thankful for. 

Today (10/07) is my 7 weeks of recovery from knee replacement surgery.  I'm moving very well. Only limping a wee bit (and only if I am not thinking about walking correctly) last Monday my Orthopedic surgeon gave me the go ahead to start driving (yay!) &amp; DH asked me if I was up to driving 75 miles to go to the concert we had tickets for.  I'm like sure, I know I can use the HOV lane for almost the entire way.  Used the cruise control as much as possible.  But still got a work out.  Did walk over a couple of miles &amp; I hurt Saturday &amp; into Sunday. 

For the most part,  MIL behaved herself (BIL was nagging at DH, both were acting like a couple of immature kids) MIL asked me if I could drive her to Oregon for Thanksgiving (she wants to go down the weekend before TG because its BIL BD) and she would pay me to take her down.  Oh, my! Not sure if it would be worth it.  I suggested she comes to our house and I can take her to the Amtrak station and pick her up. Her car would be safe at our house.  BIL said he would prefer that plan and she would be safer.  So we shall see."
974,"Hello! I feel as though I am going to become a frequent flyer in this group, unfortunately. Long stories and juicy drama ahead! Also, this is a literal novel. And not just long, but seriously, this is very very very long. 

Part of what makes everything so juicy is that this FJNMIL isn’t just a recent story, she is literally in MY LIFE story almost from day one, and so,
Mine (f, 22) and DF’s (23) backstory: 
We are basically living out Taylor Swift’s “Mary’s Song.” We met when we were 3 or 4 and at little family prayer group my parents were invited to by people at our church. We got together every Sunday, it was potluck style and all the kids would run around in the backyard. Since we were both homeschool at the time, we’d often go over to each other’s house to hang out with all our siblings in tow. It was a pretty good time! In our family friend group, all the parents, including our own, would joke about us dating or getting married later on. One day after church when I was probably around 12, his dad came up and put his arm around me and said, “hello future daughter in law.” I was sooooo embraced because this was just when I was starting to get all goggly eyes for DF. His mom would joke, but also seriously hint about how we should just get married as soon as I turned 18, BEFORE WE WERE EVEN DATING. We eventually started dating when I was 16 and he ask my father, in front of all of our parents if he could date me. Everyone was so excited... For a couple months. 

Because of the conditioning and parenting he received from his parents, DF was already an introverted person, but he would NEVER talk about his feeling until maybe a year into the relationship. We still have issues even now about him being open about how he feels towards certain things. Anyway, about three months into us dating, he heard his mom on the phone with some family friend saying she “didn’t think I was a good fit for her son.” Y’all, we were 16 and 17 and so awkward we hadn’t even held hands yet! WTF. For him to share that he was very upset that she said that was a huge deal at the time- it really mad him angry! So what changed in the three months? I have no idea. 

I had respected him mom from a young age and looked up to her as a second mother, so why wouldn’t she like me? Who wouldn’t like to have watched their child’s future spouse grow up before their very eyes and have a great influence on them? I don’t know. Shit is kinda fucked up.

Our relationship, mine and FMIL, has fluctuated throughout the year of DF and I dating. We’ve gone from totally fine, to almost not talking, to normal, to she hates me for some little thing I said or did. Seems typical enough. But the drastic change in each swing is what makes it not so typical. We’ve just gone on living our lives. 

There’s tons and tons and tons of little juicy stories I’ll eventually post if anyone wants to follow my life story, but I’ll try to leave those out just so you all can at least have a good idea of who I am and whatnot. 

Over two years ago DF and I were just dating and we broke up over some pretty heavy issues. He never discussed these issues with his parents, to my surprise. I’m sure his mother was just jumping with joy- until we got back together a month later determined to work through issues I caused and underlying issues he was causing. And then boom, two months, one college football victory game later, a super drunk friend that was making me pull my hair out, and stress drinking later, we got pregnant. We were actually pretty happy, we knew everything would work out and we had support, the only big problem was presenting his parents with the news. My parents just went through my younger, also unmarried sister telling them her and her boyfriend were pregnant. Did I mention both my parents, my sister, myself, and DF are devote traditional Catholics? Yeah, my parents were a little enraged with my sister. By the time we went to tell my parents, I started laughing and my dad knew before the words even left my mouth LOL. In the end, babies are blessing and no one really gives a shit and we were all just excited. 

Well, since DF was in college and living across the city, we only saw the in-laws on Sunday evenings for church and dinner. All the conversations were shallow and were only ever focuses on DF, his school, his progress, how much money he’d be making when he done, potential job line ups, and his grades. His family is also “devote Catholic,” but there was no spirituality aspect ever discussed. Oh well, keep saying you’re focused on the right things. Anyway, we decided to wait until we had an ultrasound done and had pictures to show. My sister already announced her pregnancy, and we were keeping ours on the DL. Week 10 rolls around, we are sitting in Cane’s, DF (still BF at the time) whips out the ultrasound after everyone finished eating. 

The look of horror and disgust on his mother’s face will forever be burned into my mind. His 10 YO sister walks over and asked, “what is that?” FMIL said, “That’s OP’s sister’s baby” knowing full well we wouldn’t be personally showing them my sister’s ultrasound. LMAO. WTF. I’m laughing just typing it xD DF pointed out that it was indeed our child, and he recently revealed to me that she was covering her mouth because he lips were quivering with rage. His dad had a general concern to our future. Ya know, the one where he was already set with great grade and job line ups. Eye roll. I will say his dad’s concerns are misplaced but genuine. 

Fast forward, they’re talking to DF in the parking lot without me, I’m waiting by my car, pregnancy hormonal eyeball leaking, and eventually his dad waves me over. Notable things they said:
•We need to put a ring on it. We need to get married NOW. We need to “make it right.” “I’m sure if you talk to Fr. so-and-so he will expedite the process.” &lt;- major issue here for us true Catholics and this does indeed come up later
•”No matter what happens between you two, you better not keep that grandbaby away from me. Promise me that.” ~FMIL
•”How is this going to make ME LOOK?!?!” ~Also FMIL. I DON’T KNOW BITCH, I’M THE ONE WALKING AROUND PREGNANT. Haha, this shit is pure comical gold. 

Eventually we got engaged on our 4th anniversary, it was more romantic and planned out than I ever anticipated from my wonderful husband to be. He really went all out and above and beyond for someone like himself! We had our baby, life was good.

Once the planning kicked in, the worst version of the JNMIL came out. She is so subtly manipulative it’s disgusting. As a child, I used to be good about figuring out how to get my way, and was manipulative, but eventually I grew some common sense as a teenager and realized I should use my “reading the room and people skills” for something better for other people than getting my way. Not everyone realizes that I guess. Anyway, it was super obvious that all he persistent little nudges were trying to get me to go in a certain direction with venue, food, dress, theme, blah blah blah. The things that don’t matter that much to DEVOT CATHOLICS. It was the ONLY thing she focused on. Constantly reminiscing about her wedding, asking me about the guest list, implying and questioning why I wasn’t inviting certain people, when she caught on, forcing me with addresses (that I already had) of people she knew we weren’t inviting. Oh, she completely insulted me in my wedding dress reveal I did for her and my bridesmaids that didn’t go shopping with me, I’ll definitely give that story its time of day ;)

The list goes on. Then, one day, DF’s parents ambush us giving us 30 minutes to get ready so we could go to “lunch” because they were feeling “miffed.” We go to McDonald’s, they didn’t order anything. Strange. Immediately, she brings up the guest list. I replied with that’s none of your business. I thought she was going to cry about how hurt she was we weren’t inviting her friends. Turns out it was over her older son who is a half brother to DF who is a fuck up. Although I know he has a lengthy criminal record, I don’t believe anything coming out of that woman’s mouth, especially the most dramatic stories, and especially after the older brother’s baby mama said that FFIL said she was telling stories he never even heard before!!!

Mini background, she was apparently married to someone, had DS1, and divorced because he was abusive. She married FFIL when DS1 was ~4. So FFIL is pretty much DS1 dad. So why wouldn’t he know some of the drastic stories of his teenage and early twenties crimes? Seems fishy, right? 

Back to MickyD’s. This basically turned into an interrogation session, I said multiple times I didn’t appreciate the way were were being talked to, how I was getting accused of saying things, getting accused of doing things, etc. long story short, we got nowhere except DF now being deathly afraid of his brother. His dad expressed genuine concern, but nothing like his wife. He held my hand is a dramatic change of mood, said he loved me and was glad I was marrying his son. Cute moment besides the entire mess leading up to it, right? THEN, she grabbed my other hand and said, “we are so happy you chose us.” WHAT THE FUCK. Then they dropped us off, gave us hugs, said “I love you” blah blah blah. 

The end bit is was screamed manipulation to me. It seemed like they, mom his mother because his dad isn’t like that, were saying “we can yell at you, accuse you, treat you like a criminal, humiliate you, and disrespect you and your relationship, and get in between you and DF, and it’s all okay.” What else was the hug for? It was a lie. We weren’t treated like we were loved, we were treated like animals! And DF grew up with this, so he ~was~ used to it and didn’t think much of it at the time until we began to talk. 

Other long story short, I went to talk to her personally about how we didn’t appreciate certain boundaries being crossed, we didn’t need an apology, we just want them to be established and respected in the future. She totally hijacked the convo, listed several reason why she hated me, some of which were things to be understandingly upset about and little itty bitty things I said YEARS AGO. It was so bad and I should have gotten up and left. She pulled out the real kicker when she started coming after my mom (who she used to be BFFs with???) and the relationship I have with her, I pointed out that she didn’t know jack shit because she hasn’t been around in years. She said, “I know more about your family than you think I do,” complete with all the attitude in the world including head and body movement to suggest she was proud of herself. My immediate response, “Well, then you’re a nosy bitch.” She got up and left LMAO 


The parts that are currently relevant:

After that, all communication and interaction ceased. We hadn’t spoken to them expect for a long phone call DF had with her. His dad has been trying relentlessly to mend things. DF went off in texts one day that he sent to both of them, and I was so proud of him. He grew a spine that day. Called them both out on their bullshit. In the process, he said his mom was being a bitch at McDonald’s. Well, you guessed it, she is so hurt over that insult. How fragile is your ego that someone calling you a bitch just crushes you??? We sat and talked with FFIL and agreed we would apologize, in person to her. But we gave them until the end of September. Oh, I forgot to mention, we are getting married in a month and there sooooo much drama with this situation that plays into that and the fact that she said to pull everyone out of the wedding party and she wasn’t attending. 

The day we were supposed to meet, she chickened out knowing full well that if we apologized, the ball would be in her court and she would have to humble herself to accept our apologies or she would have to flat out deny forgiveness. DF began texting her, she said the apologies wouldn’t be sincere and she didn’t want one anyway, she wouldn’t be attending the wedding, with every new message DF sent he was just digging a deeper grave, etc. very motherly. She got so petty as to call me his girlfriend! Then, he really shoved the shit in her face when he said I was his wife to be and I haven’t been his girlfriend in almost two years, oh, and in 40 days I’ll be his wife even though she’s hate to see it. OH MY LORD. My heart felt so full. 

Also, I sent her an apology email, I CCed his dad so he could see I sent it too. It wasn’t petty, it genuine and not passive aggressive in anyway. I guess we will wait and see what happens now that her true colors will be forced to show. Although his dad mentioned that there is a part of me that wants her blessing or whatever, I really don’t. I’ve tried for too many and have wasted so much time seeking her approval. I’m done. I don’t care if she shows or not. DF is heartbroken, but he’s beginning to truly see who she is, and for that, I am grateful. I’m almost certain she will show up and will try to make it about herself. 

Don’t need advise as I’m certain we are currently handling it well enough, but I am open to your opinions. Also, which story should I elaborate on next?"
975,"I'm pretty proud of how I have been able to stand up for myself this time. So, Eggs is still on her trip and over the week the texts from her were few and far between. After about a day of silence from her, my sister and I got a text from Dad asking us to please just send her a text that let's her know that we still care and want her to have a nice trip, yadda yadda. He's worried about her having a breakdown in a far away state. I told him that I was very clear about what it would take for contact, and that I want to keep a relationship with him but it won't be to talk about mom and he backed off. 

Then the next morning, Friday, I got this from him:


""I know I said I was done but I can't handle this anymore. I am sick to my stomach and my heart is fluttering. Your mother is crying and not sleeping and bugging me about it every night and we are at our wits end. We are all adults and should act like it. I will personally set up the counseling when she gets back so we k ow it will happen. Please for my fucking sanity drop her a goddamn text. Hopefully a single one will do the trick. saying love you have a good time and safe trip back whatever I don't care what you say. It won't make things worse and may actually help ease into counseling better when she returns. This whole thing is effing ridiculous grade school level bs. Both sides. Sorry, I just don't know what to do""

This was my reply: 

""There is literally nothing I can say or do that would be enough. I remember the last time, I have the fucking screenshots. She would not give up texting and guilting until I did what she wanted and came over for a talk. I regret so much not sticking to my boundaries. It has made it worse this time. Mom needs help. Professional help where she actually works on her bullying behaviors. It's not ok. It's not just some one time thing, she can't handle when we don't do things the way she wants. And I'm fucking done. And if you want to stomp all over my boundaries too, you can bet you're going to be right in the doghouse with her. Of course this is upsetting, mom fucked up. I'm not happy with the fallout. But I'll be damned if I'm going to just roll over and take it again for the sake of some imagined and temporary ""peace"" People in grade school don't threaten to leave each other homeless over not visiting enough. You need to recheck your seriousness gauge if you really believe this is that petty.""

His reply was just that he didn't mean to imply pettiness, just something feels wrong.

I haven't heard anything else from him this weekend and I know he had a solo beach trip planned so I hope he got to actually relax. The last text we got from mom was on Friday afternoon:

""Fine...uncle...I give up.  You dont want to hear from me?  You wont anymore.  You are worse than (awful uncle/her bro who previously cut my mom off)""

Any bets as to how long she'll actually stay away?

Edit: The winning number is 6! Six days before she texted us again. I've posted an update."
976,"So I’m the user who’s mil assaulted her infront of 100+ people at my child’s first grade pick up. I had to delete the post because it went from 100 comments to 2,700 upvotes in 4 hours and it freaked me out bc of family on here. You all gave me so much amazing advice. I named my mil Krusty the Klown, bc her name is similar to Krusty and bc I love the Simpsons.  My in the fog husband has crept out of her shadow and is being stronger and shinier everyday. So I appreciate help with getting husbands out of the fog advice from other users here!! 

We have been zero contact with this woman who hurt me for about 3 weeks until this Friday morning when my husband gets a text from krusty that his grandmother is in the hospital with heart problems (she got a pace maker put in and is doing great!!) he waits until she is out of surgery and after I prompt him that he needs to show up with flowers and a card....you’re welcome dear...he goes to support his grandma at the hospital even though it means seeing his mom for the first time. He’s a champ and grey rocks his mom while visiting his grandma. 

His brother and his gf come down today, Saturday; to see grandma at the hospital and to visit with fil and chat with him alone about his recent trip. They leave the mil at the hospital and meet fil at their home. This afternoon I get a text from just yes future sil that says “see anything missing?” And the next two texts are photos of my in-laws home.  

Well, previous to all this family drama, my mil had every known picture of me, my husband, my kids, my bil and my fsil framed, stamped, and hung In her home.  It was very awkward to say the least. It was very odd to me that she had that many pictures of us in her home. Even screen shot pics from FAcespace were printed and plastered everywhere. 

The pictures my fsil sent are of empty walls and table tops without the normal pictures and frames on them. 

THIS PSYCHO KRUSTY TOOK DOWN EVERY PICTURE OF ME, MY KIDS, MY BIL, HIS GF, AND MY HUSBAND in her home. We are talking picture frames off the wall with just screws visible.  Now I don’t know about you guys, but that just screams “bad form” to me like dustin Hoffman from hook. She is grasping at straws and every little thing like this that she does makes me mad she is doing this to our family, but it also makes me realize everyone is seeing her real face behind the mask.   

So I see this incident as a success. Success! Success!! Success!!!"
977,"First off: I'm not, I'm just having trouble conceiving. We put it on hold due to relationship issues I posted about on justnoSO and I'm honestly not sure our relationship is going to make it, anyway. Been saving up to leave. 

Just found out about grandma's will. Day after she passed away because my mom was there at the lawyer as a witness when my grandma signed, so I'm finding out before all the paperwork is done. Grandma left me $1 because I'll 'never have children that need to go to college'.

I took care of my grandma for five years, though I lived with my boyfriend. I'm hoping this is just another stunt by my mom and that it's not true. I loved my grandma, guys. She was who I went to after my mother slapped me around. She was basically my mother in the emotional sense. Her death was out of nowhere and now my mom is gloating that I won't get any money....

I mean. It isn't about the money. But damn if I haven't been saving my ass off in case things with boyfriend don't work out. This would have made me feel more secure in my future.

My grandma died yesterday. And my mother is gloating that I won't get anything. Luckily my grandma gave me a bracelet she got from my grandfather on their one year anniversary. So I have something and I'll hold onto it for dear life. But damn if it doesn't hurt to hear her bragging about this.

Update: Grandma fell and broke her hip. She's in the hospital and my mother was fucking robbing her. Grandma didn't call me because she didn't have her cell phone or my number. Police said it's a civil matter and won't come out? Grandma just gave my mom the house key to pick up her phone and charger and mom took it upon herself to 'tidy up' (funny how tidying up consisted of taking her China cabinet and its contents....) Anyway. I found out from a cousin, I guess mom was her emergency contact or something. Still figuring out what to do but mom's not at Grandma's house anymore. Once grandma decides what she wants to do I'll update. She was mad I called the police on her daughter, but she's more mad about my cockroach of a mother helping herself to her stuff.

Edit 2: VVVLC just went to NC. Fuck. Her."
978,"Basically the title. I’m 20 weeks pregnant, it’s been a shitshow of a pregnancy including bleeding, two ER visits, a risk of genetic abnormalities, and on top of that I found a lump in my breast last week that may be inflammatory breast cancer. My mom knows all this. I have an 18 month old son. I stay home with my son during the day then work on my PhD at night; I also work part time as a research assistant. My husband works full time outside the home and cares for our son while I study and work. 

Last weekend my mom took the bus to come stay with us for the weekend. She lives about 2 hours away. She got on the bus knowing she was sick but didn’t say a word to us. As soon as she got into our home she took her temperature, saw she still had a fever, took some meds and went to bed. We felt helpless because we couldn’t just send her back and none of us could afford to put her up in a hotel. So she spent the weekend with us.

By Tuesday morning my son was sick. I’m sure many of you know how horrible it is having a sick toddler in the house. No one can sleep at night and he’s fussy and completely unlike himself. Then Thursday I got sick. I’ve lost my voice completely and I feel horrible. And of course because I’m pregnant every time I sneeze or cough I piss myself. My husband took Friday off to stay home and care for me and our son. I’m pretty sure he’s getting sick now too. Our house is a massive mess, everyone feels like shit, and I’ve missed two deadlines for school because I feel like death.

Is it just me or was it horribly rude and inconsiderate to still come visit when my mom KNEW she was sick? I can’t imagine being so selfish and I’m genuinely hurt. My husband’s really annoyed but also just baffled that she would do something so careless, especially when she’s a nurse."
979,"Last week was a doozy. Gonna try not to make this too long. 

 Hubs and I have been together 25 years, married for 23 years. We have 5 kids, his two from his first marriage that we had full custody of, and three of our own. I had always noticed that we were treated differently, him, our girls, and I. He always just said it was because he was the black sheep of the family. 
I didn’t think much of it, thought maybe that’s why he always sent me to ask for things. My MIL always said yes to me, if she was able at the time. 

We now have 3 grand daughters. Our oldest (together) daughter has a 5 year old, the first great grand. She’s the love of our lives. Our oldest daughter (together) also has an Angel Baby, not gonna go into detail. Our (my step) daughter recently had a baby in July. Hubs finds out that his ex is babysitting while G1 (girl 1) works. His feeling, and mine, are extremely hurt. We are 5 minutes down the road. His ex drives an hour everyday to babysit. We start talking about it, and the truth finally comes out.

His family didn’t want us together. They wanted him to stay with his bat shit crazy ex, who, starved G1, abandoned his son, and tried to run over his Mom. That’s just a few of the things she had done in the past. So I just let loose in an angry rant about everything. How she favors her 5 oldest grandkids, from his two sisters, and his two from his first marriage. How she has four, living, great grands and she favors our nieces two boys, until G1 had hers. We never get invited to family Sunday dinner. How no one remembers my birthday, barely remembers our girls birthdays. Has never bothered to drive 5 damn minutes down the road to visit us. While my family would drive 2 1/2 hours one way to visit. He loved my family, they made him feel like he belonged. 

I was already on the verge of an emotional breakdown. Missing my Mom and her sister, who are no longer with us. Hubs reassured me by telling me this “I chose you. I would do it all over again. They are mad that I chose you. So who cares what they think. It’s their loss, not ours. I am the black sheep who married a, what did you call yourself, oh yeah an Outlander. Look at what all we have accomplished together. They are just mad cause I am finally happy. With you I have become somebody. Not the nobody they thought I was.” 

There is so much more to this story."
980,"my wedding is in 5days. I was triggered yesterday by mil’s dependence on DH and also was depressed because I felt like my wedding isn’t mine. I tried to get over it by ranting privately in my online diary but I still felt heavy in my chest. After deliberating half a day because I’m hesitant of airing laundry and I didn’t want to sound like I harp on jnmil all the time, I somewhat talked about it to my best friend who has never dated and is single. I felt like I had a deadline to feel better too, as I didn’t want to be depressed at my wedding. 

My bff responded by saying that she couldn’t really relate. She thinks that DH should have kept me in the dark abt jnmil badmouthing me (see prev post. and yea I told my bff abt this too) so that I won’t become as resentful as I am now. I said I’m glad to know abt it  because otherwise I would be spending effort, emotional labor and other resources on her despite the mil-dil rs being a scam. My bff doesn’t want to commit to my stance and says she is confused. 

I am feeling a little sad. I feel like I have to fight to justify my experiences and that people think I’m exaggerating or being over-analytical or something. I can’t tell others because most of my friends aren’t married and if they are, they probably don’t have a jnmil. I send my bff an article of list of 14 traits of a narc, and she expressed shock and said she can’t believe jnmil is that. I highlighted one point saying that narcs are good at putting up a nice image, and just said “oh well” basically. Then we changed topic and talked abt movies etc. 

nobody believes in me. I am suffering. In a bid to be ‘wise’ and ‘fair’ maybe, my bff would not commit to being on my page. I’m starting to wonder if I am a narc and I’m just bummed I didn’t recruit a flying monkey haha but honestly I dno also. I just want to be understood. In my mind that’s honestly all I want. 

what do you guys think about this? do any of y’all relate? I feel so alone.

/edit
Thank you for the comments. Seeing as there is a common impression that my DH is a problem, I thought I’d clarify that he’s actually been supportive since we had a talk last time. he’s stood by me. This time I’m just bothered that mil will always lurk and attempt to come into our lives by stealing him away as her pseudo husband. I understand DH isn’t an object and can’t be stolen but i imagine her trying to guilt him into emotionally soothing her over wdv big and small and am instantly put off by that. like, when can I let my guard down?  he doesn’t let her treat me bad directly, but I think he is susceptible to her waterworks and she can guilt him into doing things for her."
981,"Super long and drawn out story short:

My husband and I went NC with my in-laws after they had made many, many unrepentant mistakes. Refused to get shots, refused to not have drugs in the house with the baby, to meet with us to discuss their relationship with our son. Eventually they told us that they didn’t like being told when and where they could have a relationship with our son and so they would rather not have one at all and when we were ready to accept that they had “raised children before” and could “use their own judgment” we could call them. 

So so much has happened between then and now {about 8 months}. They’ve been nasty to us—telling family members I’m keeping baby from them and brainwashing my husband, and I have been just as nasty right back. Maybe even nastier to be honest but ONLY after they had been treating my husband so horribly and refused to follow rules for our son. It really hurt me that they were so happy to cut my son out without a second thought. 

So fast forwarding to now. It’s really hurting my almost too-sweet husband to be in conflict and NC with them. He has stuck by my side, stood up for me and our son and refused to budge on any of our rules for baby. They’re all reasonable rules. But I know how much it’s hurting him and it’s starting to affect our relationship. Last weekend his mother began calling and texting him nonstop saying it was urgent that she speak to him. We assumed it was the same old bullshit but eventually worried that someone may have died. He met her for coffee without me as I was not invited. 

At this coffee date she cried and begged for him to fix their relationship. Said how much she loved him, how much she missed him, how he would always be her son. No mention of my son, but my husband said “Great! I’m so happy. I’ll set up a time to talk to Wife and we can get started healing.” And her demeanor changed. She informed him I was not “ever” welcome in their lives as I was a “vile woman” that has “destroyed her family.” Hubby told her that we were a unit and he would sadly not be able to move forward without me. He left. {side note she tried to block his car and it was all very trashy}

The more I thought about how hurt my husband was I suggested that he take her up on her offer to heal their relationship without me. I want him to have his parents in his life if he wants them to be. He misses them though acknowledges that his childhood was not the best and that they have a LOT of work to do to heal. He has been crushed by how little they care about their first grandson. 

My problem is this. I don’t know how to move forward with this practically or emotionally. I’m hurt that his parents seem to be winning in the fight to put little wedges in our relationship. They have been very vocal about waiting for the day we divorce and he “comes to his senses.” While we truly don’t see that as a possibility we will be starting couples therapy to mitigate any hurt feelings and disasters as we navigate his family. They will not have any access to pictures, news, or visits with my son until they sit down with me as well—only visits and texts with my husband. 

Have any of you been in a situation where you were unwelcome in the in-law relationship but your spouse was not? How do you deal with the hurt and anger? How does that look practically? Thanks so much for the long read!"
982,"** let me start this post by saying thank you to those of you who read my last post recapping the last few years (especially my pregnancy) with my MIL, but I need to clarify. I got a lot of messages telling me not to have a talk with her, that it won’t accomplish anything, etc. I appreciate ALL the advice but this already happened. This exact discussion occurred about two weeks ago now. I feel stupid for having allowed it to happen, but my husband was/is still coming out of the FOG and I just don’t have experience dealing with people who can act so horribly. We learned our lesson. I am NC and DH is VVVVLC. There will be no more talks. This post serves to detail exactly why we went NC/VVVVLC, why BF is no longer allowed at our house, and why I made my desperate post last week asking for advice when MIL decided it would be totally fine to come over and try to bring BF along and act like nothing happened**

So I named my MIL the Town Crier because not only does she try to derail any actual adult conversation by just dissolving into tears and immediately trying to play the “poor me” card, but over the past few years she’s also taken to going around to DH’s extended family and her few church friends (stereotypical middle aged judgmental “let me see your manager” type pseudo-religious women) and whining about how she’s the victim in any given situation 🙄

Per my last post, things with Town Crier went from bad to worse during my pregnancy and with the addition of her narcissistic, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, absolute ass of a boyfriend. They got engaged and we thought maybe he’d step up and try to have a relationship with us as DH is Town Crier’s only child (I know, I know. Like I said, we had to learn all this the hard way). DH and I decided to have Town Crier and BF (I will forever refer to him as such because I just will, I don’t see him as anything more than that and certainly not family) over for a talk to try to set the record straight and smooth over hurt feelings. As you all so accurately predicted, it was a shitshow and not worth our time. Here’s what happened:


First of all, she texts us at 9:30 and says “just leaving.” For normal people, they live 45-50 min away. The way she and BF drive, it’s over an hour. So of course they’ll be late, and come just in time for DD to need her nap, which I had been trying to time around their visit since DD still only naps while she’s held and I didn’t want to have to have a potentially heated conversation while trying to get a baby to sleep. So DH and I are automatically annoyed. They show up 35 min late and it’s awkwardly tense for a few min. When they walked in, I was at the fridge grabbing DD a bottle. I greeted both of them, but then went to sit in the rocker with DD because she was already fussing and wanted to eat and go to sleep. DH has them both sit down and says “the reason we wanted to have you guys here to talk is that things have started getting back to us from the rest of the family about you being upset about DD “not knowing you” and we want to clear that up. We haven’t ever said you can’t visit, so where is that coming from?”

MIL: well I don’t get to see her and OP’s parents do, and we just don’t feel welcome.
DH: why do you not feel welcome?
MIL: well it’s just awkward.
DH: I don’t understand why though. 
BF: (doesn’t say anything, but rolls his eyes)
DH: BF, do you have something to say?
BF: well I don’t want to overstep because I’m not “part of the family” (said in sarcastic, asshole tone of voice)
DH: but you’re going to be, so we want to hear what you have to say too.
BF: okay then. You guys don’t include MIL in anything. This girl (yes, he calls her “this girl,” cringe for dayssss) cries allllll the time because allllll she wants is to see you but she doesn’t think she can. Ever since the hospital visit we haven’t been invited.
Me: First of all, if we’re going five months back in time to the hospital visit, meaning the one where you two showed up uninvited and unannounced and walked in on me naked while trying to nurse my newborn, then yes, I turned you away in that moment. I think anyone would have. I am not apologizing for that because I felt violated and it was rude and intrusive and we had made our wishes about visits clear before DD was born and they were blatantly disrespected. But are you telling me you’ve been holding that against us this entire time and that’s why you won’t talk to us?
BF: NO, YOU held it against ME!
Me: How have I done that if I haven’t seen or spoken to you since that time?
DH: The hospital visit might have been a misunderstanding (fuck that, we all know it wasn’t, but he was trying t be diplomatic) but walking in on someone who’s just had a baby after the kind of pregnancy OP had isn’t acceptable.
BF: Well maybe I’m a (name of hometown) guy, but I never heard of having to schedule appointments. If I wanted to visit someone in the hospital I just go.
Me: I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree, because I would never just come to someone’s hospital room uninvited. If they’re in a hospital they’re either sick or recovering and you don’t know what might be going on.
BF: (sulks)
MIL: (crying) we just wanted to see the baabbyyyy
Me: and I understand that, and as I said to you, I very much appreciate that everyone was excited to see her, but since we had already said we did not want anyone except immediate family -
BF: so not me then
Me: No offense, BF, but I DON’T KNOW YOU. I was TOPLESS and BREASTFEEDING. I had just had a child after an extremely difficult and dangerous pregnancy. I was vulnerable and no, you aren’t immediate family. We didn’t allow any of our friends to come see us, and if my own father and/or brother had been in the room when they wanted to observe me breastfeeding, I would’ve asked them to step out as well. You’re making this personal when it’s not, and you’re acting like I did something wrong when you are the ones who barged in on ME.
BF: (rolls eyes) well then you invite us over and you don’t even let her hold the baby!
Me: what??
BF: We’ve been here half an hour and you haven’t even let her hold that baby. And I think that sucks. That’s so rude of you.
Me: (getting legitimately pissed off now) I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but MY baby is fussy because she is hungry and tired. I am feeding her and trying to get her to sleep. When she wakes up and is no longer so upset I will gladly let MIL hold the baby.
BF: I bet she wouldn’t be fussy if you gave her to MIL.

At this point I get up, walk past him, because I am fucking SEETHING and am literally about to tell him to get the fuck out of my house and never darken my doorway again, but for my husband’s sake I don’t want to do that. I walk to the edge of the room, turn around, and say “how DARE you. How DARE you act like you know ANYTHING about my child, let alone that MIL would magically cure her when I’ve been working with her for five months. Neither of you know ANYTHING about what we’ve been through with her because you’re too selfish to ask.”

MIL: what does that mean?
DH: (explains everything about seeing two pediatric GIs, working with feeding specialists and dietitians, DD’s reflux and food allergies, being on prescription formula that’s fortified with extra calories, the failure to thrive diagnosis and the threat of a feeding tube)
MIL: (sobbing) I didn’t know she was so siiiiick
DH: because you never asked.
Me: She’s doing better now, but there is a reason we haven’t been able to come visit. There is a reason we can’t be calling you all the time if you don’t call us. My entire life right now is trying to get her better and keep her healthy. We have 3 to 5 doctors appointments per week, plus home visits from therapists and the dietician. I just don’t have time to chase anyone.
MIL: well your parents are always here
Me: My parents text to check on DD every day, my mother will drive over at literally any time of the day or night even if it’s to hold DD for 30 minutes so I can pull myself together. My mom has spent at least 6 hours with her every single weekend since she was born, excepting the four weeks after her knee surgery when she couldn’t drive, so I can have a break because DH’s schedule is so unforgiving. She knows about all the health issues and how to feed her so she doesn’t choke or aspirate. My parents make the effort.
MIL: (sobbing again) well I’m in danger of losing my job and I’m in sooo much paaaaaain
DH: what are you talking about?
MIL: well because of my foot (side note - the woman has had every test on the planet done to this damn foot. She constantly bitches about how bad her foot hurts. They literally can’t find a single thing wrong with it, so they finally told her she might have “pre-diabetic neuropathy” and put her on a low dose of gabapentin) I’m on these pain meds (again, gabapentin, it’s not like she’s on fucking oxycodone) and I’ve been falling asleep at my desk (sob sob sob)
DH: Why would you take pain killers that make you drowsy when you’re working and driving? (Again, DH is a cop. He does not like hearing this information. He pulls people over and cites them for doing exactly this. It’s DANGEROUS)
MIL: because it huuuuurts
DH: It sounds like you have to talk to your doctor about another option. But anyway, if you’re so tired and you can’t drive to us safely, you could TELL US that so we know why you aren’t coming over or ever offering to help. Instead you just say “it’s not worth the drive” and make us feel like we don’t matter.
MIL: okayyyyy but we’re also soooo busy. 
DH: with what?
MIL: well we have to pick out the finishes for our house and we have sooo much to do! (Side note - MIL and BF bought a new build condo in a 55+ community and yes, they get to pick all the finishes. She’s the only person on the fucking planet who can turn getting a CUSTOM BUILT HOME WITH HANDPICKED FINISHES into something negative). 
DH: okay, I’m done hearing excuses because it sounds like all you do is find reasons you can’t come over and then blame us. If you can’t visit that’s fine, but that’s YOUR choice and you need to stop putting it on us. 
MIL: *sulks*

BF: well you guys don’t make an effort either
Me: again, what are you talking about?
BF: when you came to [cousin’s] house this gal (again, why the fuck does he call her that) would’ve LOVED a call. She would’ve dropped EVERYTHING to come see the baby.
Me: (looks directly at MIL) I hope you aren’t the one telling him this because that’s completely false and you know it. (Looks back at BF) we had plans to come to see cousin and we called MIL as well as all the other relatives to let them know we would be in the area for a few hours. Only cousin 1, cousin 2, and aunt were able to stop by as it was midday on a Friday, so everyone else was working. We were not playing favorites, it happened to coincide with the one and only appointment we ever had that was close to [hometown] so we figured we’d swing by. MIL was made aware of this and told us that she had to eat lunch at her desk and couldn’t get out early. We told her we were sorry to hear that, but we wouldn’t be staying past 3 or so because DD gets fussy in the car and we didn’t want to get caught in rush hour traffic.  So no, she did not “drop everything,” and yes, she “got a call.”
BF: well that was the only time you guys ever came to [hometown].
Me: Yes. It was. And I have explained several times why that is and I don’t feel like I need to continue to repeat myself.
DH: We are still in survival mode here. We have a baby with extra concerns and health conditions and all we are trying to do is make sure she stays healthy and grows properly. We don’t have a lot of time for anything else, so I’m sorry if it seems like we aren’t making an effort but we are just trying to do the best we can for our daughter and everything else comes second.

At this point the conversation kind of dies and DD starts waking up. DH reaches to take her from me, and I said “hang on, let me check her diaper.” BF rolls his eyes AGAIN as if I’m just inventing reasons to not let MIL hold her (as much as I’d like to do that, hi, babies need diaper changes??). I chose to ignore that and changed her diaper, then handed her to MIL. However, I quickly realize MIL is following exactly none of our instructions about washing hands, keeping her hands out of the baby’s mouth/baby’s hands out of her mouth, and not kissing on the face. Keep in mind that at this point MIL has been crying for the duration of the “talk” and she has gone through about ten tissues. It’s sort of my fault because I went to hand her the baby and then realized after the fact. So I’m grossed out and pissed off, but I say politely “would you mind using the hand sanitizer (we keep a bottle of it on the coffee table for this exact reason) just because you were blowing your nose?” BF again rolls his eyes, MIL kind of shrugs and meekly uses the hand sanitizer while still holding DD on her lap. I decided I was sick of being the bad guy so I sent my husband a discreet “NO KISSING ON THE FACE” text. He got it, read it, and then looked kind of confused at me but didn’t say anything. Now yes, at this point it’s a DH issue, I’ll get to that. But basically everything MIL did pissed me off. She talked to DD in not only a weird baby voice, but used improper grammar the whole time. “I bet Daddy don’t like leaving you when he goes to work/you got them toes again/did you eated your whole bottle?” Like seriously lady … BEC stuff I know but at this point I hate everything about both of them. MIL keeps holding DD out to BF and saying “is that BF? There he is! Say HIIIIII.” Um, no, if my child literally never gets to know this man I will consider it a victory rather than a loss. But whatever. I busied myself with washing bottles so I wouldn’t actually sear them with my glare and put up with it for 20 minutes for DH’s sake.

Then BF says “well we should be going huh sweetie” to MIL and she’s immediately like “oh yesssss, we have to go pick out light fixtures.” You know, the thing she was bitching about earlier but is now exciting again. Whatever, good, they’re leaving, I don’t care what the reason is. So we all stand up and DH takes DD back from MIL. MIL goes to give me a hug and I say “I hope we can all move forward from now on and discuss things like adults if anything like this comes up again. We want DD to have a relationship with you, but in order to do that WE need to have a relationship with you.” MIL nodded. BF said “that’s all we want too.” Yeah right, asshole. Again, whatever.

After they leave I go upstairs to take a nap because I am literally drained from this encounter. I tell DH I am less than thrilled with the way it went overall, that I hope BF burns in hell, and that I think we might have gotten through to MIL but that my hopes are not high because BF is surely just going to feed her bullshit about how WE should be “making the effort” and get her to think we’re awful again. After my nap I tell DH that I did NOT appreciate him not confronting his mom about the kissing on the face thing, nor did I feel like he had my back. I told him I felt like he went into cop/mediator mode instead of defensive husband/father mode, which is what the situation called for. I asked him to look at it from an outside perspective and said “objectively speaking, just the conversation itself, is BF the asshole or am I?” DH admitted BF spoke very rudely to me and he should’ve stood up for me more, but said he was more concerned about just trying to keep the peace. I get it (and please don’t attack DH, he’s really trying) because it’s only been since he met me he has ever confronted MIL about anything, let alone had his own thoughts and feelings. He was kept so downtrodden by her and forced to be her puppet that it’s empowering, but also very scary and foreign to him to be standing up to her. We’re working on shining his spine, but it’s going to take time. I do think that me being SO angry and expressing that about BF’s behavior resonated with him and he is not going to be so docile anymore. He has now told his mother that BF no longer has his blessing because he doesn’t feel comfortable around him and doesn’t want his wife and child around him either. MIL didn’t respond ...

* yes I know there was a lot of JADEing going on. DH and I are working on it. This sub has been invaluable. I used to read it for 50/50 entertainment and also tips on how to deal with what I thought was a mild JustNo. Now I’m utilizing all the resources and I’m so grateful for the support. DH and I are trying hard to shine our spines, learn how to handle this, and do what’s best for us and DD *"
983,"My husband and I were driving my MIL home from dinner. He asks his mom if she found a new doctor, and she goes:

""I did! It took me awhile because I had to find someone with an English name.""

*Background*: I do not have an ""English"" name. I have an Arab name.

I literally said ""That is SO RACIST!!!"" and DH starts naming all these doctors she's had in the past *who she worked for and claimed to like* who were not white. 

She basically ignores us, and we let it go. That was an hour ago and I am honestly still in shock. Like, would I not be a good doctor because my name is Arab? Is that why she's never really bonded with me even though we've known each other for 7 years? Is that why she talks over me and leaves the room when I'm talking to her?

I'm pregnant, and I do **not** want our kids getting these ideas in their heads (TBF, neither does DH). His solution is to explain to the kids that their grandmother is racist and to ignore everything she says. Are there any other (better?) options?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. For those who read my last post, she's refusing to give back our pillows that she took because ""her movers lost the box with her linens"". Yup, there are 5 pillows on your bed and you are 1 person. So...no more borrowing anything, sorry MIL!"
984,"TW: Abuse, death, and gun violence lightly mentioned. Hi gang! Buckle up, cause this is a long one. Previous posts have background info. I'm doing this in chronological order and this happened years ago, so no need for advice. But would love to hear your thoughts or similar situations in the comments! 

This is a story about a girl who was lucky. It's me. I'm the lucky one. Absolutely blessed, just dripping in luck and fortune. Or so my JNMIL loves to tell people. 

Admittedly, I am pretty lucky. I have a loving husband, happy dogs, a comfortable home, great friends, good jobs, a decent sense of humor, and an amazing family. I say them last because they are the bottom, the base, of everything I am today. In a sea full of JN's I have been blessed with a tight knit family of JY's. We have each hit rough points in our lives that I really don't think we could have gotten through without each other. Everyone in my life knows you don't mess with my family. Shit talk me all you want, but don't ever bring my family or my dogs into it. I get serious about it. Like cue Brad Pitt in Fight Club ""Do not fuck with us."" level serious. The only person I put before them is DH. And they all absolutely love him so it makes life far easier, especially on holidays and such. 

MIL even used to come to some events, which is how I know she is the one spewing this ""lucky"" shit. She told my mother that it must be nice to have such an uncomplicated life and to always have things work out for her. Laying this down as the foreground is her attempt to play the woe is me card. Look at all you have compared to me, wah wah wah. Through the years we have had DH's dad, aunt and uncles, cousins, and family friends all tell us she has told them this. That her son abandoned her to be with a spoiled princess who must have a fairy godmother because she is so lucky and everything she wants she gets. Hint: the things that I wanted I worked my ass off for. My car, my home, my wedding, my degrees, all of it has been earned. Unless any of you know places simply handing out Master's, this fact shouldn't come as a shock. It didn't bother me one bit that she said these things to people, because these are people I've known for years and know my character and respect DH, so whatever. Keep rambling on lady, I'm not the sad attention seeker. The only time I was bothered by her ""lucky"" comments was the day we were moving DH into my apartment. 

So I get to her house with a Uhaul ready to load furniture to store at my mom's storage locker. I'm reversing into the driveway and she comes out screaming like an idiot. ""STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! You're going to hit the garage!!!"" Startled, I stop, hop out, and see for myself the ten feet I still had. So I hop back in, continue reversing, and ignore her as she yells some more and hits the side of the uhaul. Weird fight to pick lady, but go off. So I go inside and the next hour is DH and I moving all the big furniture and her hovering over us, drink in hand, yelling and making noises every step we take. I should mention at this point that her voice is the same pitch as dentist tools. That high pitch drill sound. So every ""DH lookout!"" is like a needle being shoved into your eardrum. Realizing I'm about to snap, DH wisely tells her to just let us move stuff and to go sit down on her special fucking couch. 

Spoiler alert, she didn't. She made herself another drink and while we were getting stuff settled in the uhaul, she took it upon herself to go into his bedroom and start rifling around in his boxes. So we come inside and find her sitting on his floor, clothes everywhere, crying over a picture he had wrapped up. It's of him, his dad, and his three uncles. This is where shit really hit the fan. 

DH asked her what the hell she was doing, she has no right to go through his things! She wailed about how she wanted to make sure he was bringing something that would remind him of her, and instead found the picture. He was abandoning her the same way his dad did and she didn't deserve either of their treatment. (His dad did leave her, through divorce because they had a volatile relationship and they would have killed each other) Well, my love was having none of her games and gave her the truth: ""I'm leaving because of your actions. How you disrespect me and constantly hate on TasmanTiger is too much to be around. It isn't changing anytime soon so I'd rather invest in the next stage of my relationship with TasmanTiger."" Swoon. Sweet as those words were though, DH didn't think about where he had just directed her attention.

It was like a slow motion moment, I turned from him to her as she whipped her head in my direction, the most loathsome look on her face, and fire in her eyes. 

""This would never be happening if it wasn't for YOU!"" She then proceeded to call me a few names before DH cut her off, telling her this was because of her and her alone. Her drinking was ruining everything in her life. So of course she starts crying again about how he had no idea what she went through with his dad (divorced 13 years at this point, seek help if it was really that scarring) and that she was losing him too. He was abandoning her for miss perfect. And her perfect mom, who had no idea what hardship was. Record. Fucking. Scratch. Before I could even stop myself, I was crouched down in her face telling her ""Don't you ever fucking bring up my mother. She has been through hell and back and she did it without collapsing into a sloppy alcoholic who drives everyone in her life away."" 

A little background needed here. My family has gone through difficult stuff together. When I was 8 my dad was arrested for being abusive to us kids. He went to prison and ended up dying a year later due to the effects of his own alcoholism. I hate alcoholics because of this. But I dont hate him. It took me a long time to understand that abuse is a cycle and he drank to cope with the abuse against him as a child. Understanding this has saved my family and future generations from both alcoholism and abuse. He got arrested only a few weeks after we almost lost my two older sisters. In a high school massacre. This was before everyone had cell phones, so I had to just sit and wait at home while my mom went to find them at the evacuation spot. That feeling of terror, watching the news as kids were being wheeled into ambulances and literally running for their lives, is something I will never forget. And it devastates me each time another school filled with kids goes through these shootings. My mother dealt with so much in that year. And yet, she continued working, earning her degree, raising four kids, and never once failed at making sure we knew how much she cared for us. I honestly dont know how she did it and I will always look to her as a model for strength, resilience, and love. 

Alright, back to the story. So I'm in MIL's face, ready to go blows with her. DH could tell and being the only smart one in the room at this point, pulls me away and outside. I take his dog for a walk to cool off as he absolutely lays into her. The jist of it was that she had no right to talk to me that way, I was his partner whether she liked it or not, and that it was her actions and drinking that drove him to leave. He knew she only wanted him back there to be her sonsband and he was not placed in this world to play her shady little games. I fully believe he said all this, and probably more, because when I got back she had locked herself in her room and was audibly sobbing his name. Even his dog had that ""wtf"" look in his eyes. We packed up his last items and went to my mom's house for lunch. I walked in that door and gave her the biggest hug, so thankful to be her child. We never told her what MIL said, she's dealt with enough bullshit to last a lifetime. She knows about the ""lucky"" comments to relatives though, people have jokingly asked her what her secret is to having the only perfect child on Earth lol. 

Sweet, well thanks for reading my book. You guys are awesome, this community is awesome. I'm gonna go enjoy a nice fall day with my DH and dogs, who I am very lucky to have!"
985,"Trigger warning: mentions suicide

So, moving is going well. Everything is in place and now we are just packing and selling. Packing and selling a lot. DH and I have sold at least $1500 worth of stuff and MIL has sold about $300 worth, which is great. 

Today is Sunday and we are on countdown to the moving day, which is about 20 days away! Possession is in 17 days.

MIL has no idea where she is going and doesn’t like any of the places she is looking at and to be honest I think she doesn’t want to like any of the places. There is very little I can do to encourage or force this issue because everything I’ve done to help has been shoved to the side. I’ve been the one posting everything and taking care of the people coming to pick up her possessions that she has agreed to sell and when DH told her to be thankful, she said thank you for selling my stuff but this item and this item hasn’t sold. Just to prove a point?

And, today, after DH went outside and I was standing in the front room, she was in the far room and didn’t know I was downstairs. I heard her say something into her phone along the lines of “elements of suicide”. So I asked her what she said into her phone and she denied it. I told her that I heard her say something about suicide and asked if that was what she said and she claimed she was looking up prayers. I did not hear prayers and my hearing is not that bad. So I let it go and asked her about her plan for the end of the month, and she said she was looking at places tomorrow. And I asked about the place she apparently already had and no she doesn’t like it. And she’s getting defensive when I’m asking.

My family is being gracious enough to move her, and she is not entirely fighting. She is packing her stuff, she is agreeing to sell some belongings so we don’t have to move as much stuff but now she is contemplating putting her stuff into storage and finding temporary accommodations to which we explained that we weren’t moving this stuff again.

It breaks my heart if she actually is thinking about hurting herself but I’m not sure exactly what to do. I don’t know if I should tell my husband and run the risk of her stressing him out more or if I should call the crisis hotline or the police when she obviously doesn’t want help. As a side note, she also told me a very long time ago when DH and I started dating that as soon as he left, she was going to commit suicide, but it just never happened. So I don’t think she would seriously do it, but I’m also worried she might."
986,"For context I have 2 older brothers. B1 is her golden child, B2 is always the scapegoat and I’m the last child and only girl. 

FDH and I gave Wanderer a lift to dinner with FMIL (just yes) and a lift back home on Saturday. 

On the way back I was being an annoying child and poking her leg from the from and faux trying to get her attention. 

She mentioned that I’m her baby and FDH and I told her I really wasn’t. 

She then went on to say that I was her baby, just like B1 was too. 

FDH and I waited for it, but it never came. So I prompted her with a loud “aaaaaaaannd?” 

She didn’t get it yet so FDH mentioned B2, asking if he was her ‘baaaaaaaaby’ too. 

She said he wasn’t really. 

Wow. Just fucking wow. 

B2, for whatever reason (I don’t need to know, just respect it), is NC with Wanderer and has been for the past couple of years... pretty much since she returned to our country. 

That was just... fucking wow."
987,"Ambivalent for flair, but advice is okay. See post history for the whole scoop, but just a brief recap: my JNMIL is visiting my home country for waayy too long after she visited 6 months ago. She is thankfully staying in a hotel but did stay one night with us. 

In the first 12 hours, she said she wanted to re-fold our clothes more neatly, rearrange our kitchen, and asked about our finances. Maybe she thinks she’s being helpful but it sounds like criticism to me. I said “no” to everything and she said “i just don’t like standing around!” Woman, read a book or something and stay out of our closets?? How hard is it to just sit down and NOT comment on how our clothes are folded or our pots and pans are arranged??? 

DH and I agreed that he would handle her these next couple of weeks because I didn’t invite her, I’m busy, and I just don’t want to play translator/tour guide. But she needs his help for everything. She’s complaining about the lack of English but I don’t know what you expect when you’re not in an English-speaking country. She’s as helpless as I expected she would act and it’s draining DH who also has to work. Unfortunately, like I told him: not my circus, not my monkeys. He can deal with his own mother. 

I’m also getting a lot of message from friends and family because she’s been posting a daily photo dump on the book of faces and people are surprised to see photos of her and DH, but none of me. My JY mom and SIL both texted asking if I was with them. I was, but she’s trying really hard to pretend I don’t exist. 

She’s been sulky and difficult  the past few days and it’s uncomfortable for all of us. I’m trying to hold my ground on my boundaries (ex; she isn’t allowed to come over during the day because I’m working) and I really have no desire to meet any of her needs. But I’m unreasonably worried that she’s going to do what she does best and bad-mouth me when she goes back. I don’t reeaaalllyyy care but obviously I care just enough to worry about it. 

I know I’m being an adult. I’m enforcing my boundaries without being mean and that’s the best I can do for myself. But it’s exhausting being around someone who refuses to also act like a grown woman. I don’t understand why these women behave this way. It’s like she ripped a page out of How To Be A Bitch to your Husband’s Wife to study on the flight over. If she’s going to criticize my housekeeping and pretend I’m not here, what does she think is going to happen? What does she expect? I’m so irritated that I feel like the bad guy even though I know I’m taking care of myself."
988,"I had two woooonderful weeks without seeing my in-laws.
Yesterday we ended up seeing All. Of. Them.
My fiances grandfather (FMILs dad) just showed up at our place. We still don't know where he got our address from, but I'm assuming it was my FMIL who gave it to him.
I was so confused about what he was even doing here so I let him in, despite us being about to leave (we had to leave to go to my SOs parents house, so I didn't really mind) and the house being a complete mess. I felt kind of rude, I didn't even offer him something to drink. But then I reminded myself that it isn't rude when I'm not expecting company and my company is expected elsewhere.
I usually wouldn't invite anyone in if I'm not expecting them, even friends and family. But my SO has recently started to suspect his grandfather is showing early signs of dementia, he's been acting unlike himself recently and I thought it was best to let him in and see if he was a bit beside himself and in need of help.

Anyway, this isn't what I'm supposed to be talking about.
What I am supposed to be talking about is the shit show that was last night.
In my last post I mention their oldest family dog dying and yesterday all of us got together to burry her ashes in their back yard. I thought it was a bit strange, since they had something resembling a funeral ceremony. But maybe I'm the weird one? Idk, I didn't grow up with any pets so I might not completely understand.

I think FMIL has noticed I've been dropping the rope recently and generally being tired of her shit because she was really trying to behave herself.
Or maybe she was too busy to play grandma of the year with my SOs nephew. None the less I liked not having her breathe down my back all night.
I even started to doubt myself a little. Maybe I was being too harsh, maybe she wasn't so bad bla bla bla 

Well, she drove us home and on the way home her mask dropped and she was back to being a .. well a bitch. 
She more or less went into a 20 minute monologue trash talking and gossiping about my FBILs girlfriend. 
Apparently she had called her crying asking for help  about a week ago, because her ex had filed for sole custody over their son and he wanted her to have as little visitation as possible. My in-laws are some of those people that somehow know everyone and they're always owed a favour from somewhere, so my FSIL wanted to get in contact with one of MILs lawyer friends.

I really didn't know what to say, so I just didn't say anything and now I feel bad about it.
It's really not any of our business what issues my SIL has with her ex. 
It's not the first time I've heard her be such a gossipy bitch, but this has been the worst so far.
Do you have any ideas on how to shut her down the next time?"
989,"TLDR; my ex and I broke up this summer because he couldn’t admit the fact that he is his moms emotional husband. My dumbass got back with him recently and the same problems are happening, but he is aware of it and ready to solve this together. I’m starting to have doubts again that this was all a mistake. I am more positive than I was before about the relationship, however not sure if that’s enough to stay and commit to do such exhausting work.

Btw- If you want to be really invested you guys can read my old post with more details of their dysfunctional mother/son dynamic. 


The Timeline 
We’ve been together since 2017. Broke up in July, went NC in August and mid September we start texting again because we missed each other. We met up, had dinner and and very obvious how much we still love and care for each other. After dinner we had the talk. He said he’s been in therapy, and told his mom she can’t call and text him all day unless real emergency. So far she’s respected this boundary. He said he made her agree that me and him come first, not her. They talked about it he said. He tells me I am his priority, not her and she now knows that. I decide to get back with him because I saw this as major progress, he’s finally on my side, at he’s finally AWARE that she is such a negative energy (giving him anxiety and making him feel guilty for no reason simply because she needs that emotional validation) and started to stand up to her after literal decades of manipulation that got his normal meter all whacked out. But little did I know despite the amount of love and closeness bond we share, and despite all this self-awareness, this is some serious fucking work. 3 weeks in and I am tired.

Present Day
We have our first appointment with a very good couples therapist in two weeks and one special getaway trip that he planned for us after our first session. I currently am taking “space” from her, and my boyfriend has respected this. She has already asked my boyfriend why I hate her. She doesn’t have my contact neither do I have hers. I have no interest in being around this woman. She lives very close by to him and they have lunch or dinner twice a week. 


Moving Day
The weekend she was going to move into her new place which is yes, less than 10 mins from my bfs, him and I happen to be on a weekend trip in a nearby city. The second our plane landed he said his mom and sister need a tv. He is tired and hungover from this weekend trip and they know he’s been out of town, and yet they request a tv and tv stand from target. So what does he do? He gets a tv and set it all up and ALSO brings over HIS OWN lazy boy so that she could have something to sit on, helps them unpack, Hangup pictures etc. we land at 12pm and he got home at 8pm because he was running around all day like a servant boy. When I asked him about it, he said that’s what sons do they help their family. And I said no, sometimes you can put your emotional needs first. You could’ve said let me shower and take a nap and unpack I will be there to help you guys in a few hours. He thanks me for helping him see this and we move on. Like I said. Normal meter off the charts. 

Last Week
Did she fake an injury fall to test his love for her? I have a feeling she did fake it, but I could just be making up a false narrative based on the negative image I have of her... y’all tell me. This is all just speculation. So back to the no excessive calls or texts rule. I feel like she hates that. So maybe she was texting him and he wasn’t responding that day so she wanted to get attention or whatever tf it is. What happened was she was walking his dog with his sister while he was at work. All of a sudden she “trips” and smashes her face into the concert. Shes bleeding bad, may need a couple stitches on her left cheek.  and the sister calls an ambulance. My bf rushes home from work to the hospital all worried. I think she gets a high when he’s worried for her it is so sickening to me. She is discharged from hospital with no stitches just severe heavy bruising and her eye is almost swollen shut. 

I actually came over this day to be nice and say hey how are you and when I saw her banged up face I felt bad. I mean she IS an elderly woman (late 60s) and it’s easy for people that age to fall. But then I snapped back to reality when his sister made a joke during dinner “it’s like you froze mom, like what happened to your arms” and she responds quickly it’s because I was wearing flip flops. And in my head I’m like, natural human instinct is to put your hands out when you fall or trip right. Did she lose feeling/reflex in her arms all of a sudden? I mean she’s a fairly healthy retired woman... I will never know her true intent this day. 

After dinner we are watching tv. She asks my bf if he wants to touch her face. He gets uncomfortable and says no I don’t want to touch it. I guess she wanted him to feel her bruising??? 15 mins later he gets up and says okay goodnight love ya we’re leaving and he leans in to hug her and she kissed him on the cheek so I guess that’s normal????

The TV
For some reason she can’t get the tv to work which is another tactic she likes to use. The “I’m an elderly woman I don’t know how to work the tv please help me” act. It’s Saturday afternoon, his house. We’re actually talking about her and how to move forward and she calls. He doesn’t answer. She texts. I glance at the phone screen. He says she just needs helps with the tv again. She calls again. He asks me if he can pick up. I felt really bad because I feel weird when ppl ask me permission to do something, I felt like a controlling jealous gf so I said of course. He puts her on speakerphone I guess so I can hear. She says the tv is not working. He’s annoyed and says what do you mean. Have you tried clicking the HDMI switch button like I told you? She said yes it’s just not working idk what’s going on there’s a blank screen now. He’s like just press the button until it says hdmi 3 and he’s annoyed again. She says I’ll figure it out it’s okay. What are you guys doing? He says we just got home and I’ll call you later. She said okay bye. 
Then she sends him pink heart emojis and this is so gross to me. I know some people send lovey doves emojis  to their kids/parents but for me she definitely sees him in a different way. He looks exactly like his late father too. 

Idk if I’m looking for advice or common stories or just venting. We have talked about marriage and idk what I’m signing up for jfc. If you guys have any idea how to navigate this lmk. I am not really a confrontational  person but next time I see her I want to ask her how her TV working so she knows I know wtf is going on. Over time I’m sure my bf will really tell her off but knowing her I’m afraid she will threaten suicide and actually do it like this is just so ridiculous."
