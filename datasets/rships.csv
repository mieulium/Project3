0,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
1,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
2,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
4,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
5,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
6,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
7,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
8,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
9,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
10,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
11,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
12,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
13,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
14,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
15,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
16,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
18,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
19,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
20,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
21,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
22,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
23,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
24,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
25,"We've been friends for approximately two years but i wouldn't declare us to be best friends. I didn't mind her smelling bad because she always did but I cannot bear to be around her anymore. We don't hang out it's just she really sticks to me when we're at school. Here's a few exemples of the bodily odors being a bother :
• We take the bus together, morning and afternoon and she does not brush her teeth, in the morning she makes conversations but she breathes on me and i have a very fine nose. I just try to look away while she talks but she sits so close to me I almost vomit. 
• She always smells of vomit, or spoiled food. Her clothes, her hair, everything. I do know she cooks a lot at home but that's not a reason for her to neglect her smell.
• This morning I did not want her to sit with me, so I put my bag on the seat but she sat on top of it... Today she smelled the worst she ever had. My first thought when I smelled it was to open the window but it was cold. Even when i tried to not breathe i could just feel it getting worse. She smelled like feet, the bacteria that accumulates on your feet when you don't clean them. It was horrifying. The smell was so bad that her shoulder was touching mine and it got stuck on my clothing... I told my friends and they told that it was really bad while gagging. I had to go outside to air myself out from her smell. 
• Besides topic but she's always sick and constantly cough on me and i'm very icky about it.

I do not want to unfriend her because she is very kind and that would be unfair to her, I simply do not want her to sit next to me anymore, or speak to me in a setting where she's close to me. Does anyone have any advice on how I could sneak around her and sit alone in the bus ? It is a quite crowded bus and she did sit on my bag...

TL;DR! : My friend smells horrifyingly bad and it gets stuck on my clothing because she sits next to me in the bus."
26,"I think there's something wrong with me and I genuinely feel like I don't know how to fix it.

My wife and I have been married for almost a year and a half now. She's my world, she's my best friend. I want to always make her happy and I feel like a failure when I don't. So when she does get upset with me, it upsets me too. I used to spiral when this would happen, forcing her to take care of me instead of just letting herself be mad and it was such a shitty thing for me to do, even if I didn't mean it. And that's the problem, I never mean to make her upset but I still do.

It's usually small things that just add up and I feel like maybe there's something actually wrong with me where I just don't pick up on that small thing being not okay. And I try to be mindful but I still end up messing up and I can't stand that I do that. I want to be better but I just don't know how. What do I do? How do I be a better husband?

TL;DR: I don't notice things that upset my wife until it ends up building up and really upsetting her. What is wrong with me? And how do I be a better husband?"
27,"(Might have to delete) I've been with my boyfriend for at least a year now, and we started off great. We understood each other and was able to work through problems together. Even when we fought, we always managed to come back to each other at the end. There were times when he needed to be left alone to calm down and I would do that, but I would also get a lot of anxiety not being to communicate with him. Recently, it's been harder to get through to him, he shut me out completely, insult me, call me crazy, and a headache, regrets me, tries to break up with me, and has even thrown a shoe at me when I was walking away from him, and he knows I get scared of physical violence. I end up pouring my heart out and profusely apologize getting him to ""come back"". Sometimes it worked, but only after all the harsh things he would say. There were times I would be in the wrong too, I wouldn't be able to hide my anger and stay quit because I'm too upset, but after 10-15 mins or so I usually tell him my problem, resulting him to getting more angry at me and calling me an asshole for my behavior. I told him I was working on it and I really have been, Never have I cursed and belittled him in an argument but he seems like he has no problem doing so. Last night, when we hung out with his friends, I couldn't shake the feeling off that he said his friends hated me, so I stayed quiet, but I still went because I wanted to be with him. I didn't do a great job at hiding my resentment at my boyfriend because I kept remember all the things he said to defend his friends. We came home last night at he proceeded to throw my clothes in trash, toss our pictures, and tear up my letters, forcing me to sleep downstairs and told me to leave. I came back in the room later at night to sleep in the bed and asked to cuddle earlier in the morning which he agreed and we hugged and gave me kisses.   
It's so hard to leave because I've become emotionally, financially, and physically dependent on him. I sleep over for work and school, and I love his family and his family loves me. He's told me I'm toxic and I'm just sad and hurt. Is it me? I love him, I just want to learn how to communicate with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: my boyfriend constantly insults me but still takes me back, I'm araid to lose him and I want to know what I'm doing wrong."
28,"
I(27m) broke up with my girlfriend(27f)  of 4 years 9 months ago. Things got really bad between us before I left and on top of that, I was getting pressured by her parents to either marry her or leave. It was a difficult decision and ultimately I decided to break it off. She was devastated, at the time I thought I was making the right call. For about 6 months she was begging me to reconsider and I was trying to stay strong in my decision. I finally started entertaining the idea of getting back together but when I would start in on the subject with her she would get angry with me and demand apologies.  I couldn’t swallow my pride and admit I had made the mistake. Now here I am a couple months later ready to do all of that and she has just barely started dating and has gone out with this guy for like a week.  We still have been talking this whole time. She says she loves me but isn’t in love with me, and now I’ve flown half way across the country to tell her how much I still love her and how big of a mistake I made and to beg her to take me back.  I’m fully expecting her to deny me but I figured I had nothing to lose if I already lost her so I’m going for it anyway.

TLDR:  broke up with girlfriend of 4 years, finally ready to get back together with her for good but I doubt she will take me back now. Trying anyway."
29,"We’ve been on many dates, even a concert over the summer. I’ve met his family and most of his friends. He’s in the military and his last girlfriend cheated on him all three years they were together. But what bothers me is on occasion I won’t hear from him for a few days and on rare rare occasion a week. It usually starts out with him leaving my text on “read”. 

I’ve already talked to him about it. And usually he’s just defensive “I work, military, school/helping my sister get in her feet”. You know all the regular excuses, but nothing changes. This weekend his best friend had a get together and everyone left pretty early. But his best friend, him and myself were up until 6am playing wii and singing karaoke haha. In the midst of all this he breaks out telling me how great I am and how much he cares about me. And how he can’t imagine me w anyone else, meanwhile his friend is dying laughing at him. And he just keeps going on this long rant about how he has all of these walls up. But he really just doesn’t want to lose me. Mind you that was post 6 shots of jack .. (over the course of 8 hours). 

Anyways the next day (Sunday) he didn’t text me. So Monday I decided to text him and I was left on read. He texted me yesterday and we talked for maybe 20 mins. And then again he left my response on read ... so today he texted me and I decided to leave him on read. Just because I needed time to think about if i wanted to continue to pursue this. All my friends say “screw him come out w us” or “there’s so many hot guys out there”. And I just don’t really like that mindset or agree w a lot of ideals in my generation. 

So here I am - do I keep pursuing this and put how I feel aside? And give him some more time and space to open up and trust me. Do I keep giving him the cd shoulder and see what happens. Or do I just move on and find someone who is on the same level as me. This guy just has a really great heart and we mesh really well and we want the same things. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone I’ve felt this way towards. Granted I’m only 22, but hey. 

Tl;dr - after 5 months of dating do I continue dating him and seeing where it goes? Or should I count my losses and walk away?"
30,"Long post and on mobile. I deeply apologize, but I just wanted to get in as many details as possible!

In the summer of 2018, I (23M) was offered an internship in another state. I was living with my parents (50F &amp; 49M) during the previous semester because I was paying for my schooling out of pocket. When I moved for the internship, I invited my girlfriend (20F) to come with me. We lived together for the summer and once my internship came to an end my parents offered both of us a place to stay. Seeing as we had grown comfortable living together and it was an opportunity to save money for my schooling, we took them up on their offer. My girlfriend and I have been living with my parents and younger brother (11M) since August 2018, she and I will be moving out at the end of this December.

Despite the fact it was my parents’ idea for us to live with them, they constantly give us grief.  My parents have always been extremely condescending in my life. My mom is passive-aggressive, and my father is just straight-up rude when it comes to communicating their opinions on my life. Additionally, my mom is very nosy, she has zero boundaries when it comes to privacy, and she shows no remorse when I politely ask her to stay out of my affairs. She makes living and having a relationship with her extremely difficult.

My parents have established a transactional relationship with me instead of one that feels the way it should between parents and their child. I am on my final semester of school, and throughout my entire college career, they have put about $4,000 towards my schooling (tuition) while I have paid for everything else (tuition and books totaling around $32,000) through student loans, scholarships, and money out of pocket. Ever since I moved back in with them, they constantly remind me that they expect to be paid back once I start my new career in January. I have discussed with them that I am more than happy to pay them back in the way of starting a college fund for my brother. They have agreed to this yet still, remind me of this debt I have with them.

Anytime I talk about my plans to move and start my life independently, they feel the need to bring up the money I owe them instead of being happy that I am making such progress in my life. My mom also reminds me of any bills I have to pay for the month since she goes through my mail on top of it all. I have voiced how I do not like talking about my finances with them since my parents are constantly condescending towards me when it comes to money. I have tried to explain that I am responsible enough to take care of my own bills without them going through my mail to remind me when they are due. I have explained this multiple times throughout the year, yet it feels as though my feelings and wishes are not being heard. It is extremely frustrating, disheartening, and makes me not want to interact with them at all.

Today I felt as though I have been pushed to my limit with my parents. After I came home from work, I shared with them that I have been getting more excited to move because my girlfriend and I have been looking at apartments for when we move and that I did well on my midterm exams, and how I just overall felt as though everything is finally coming together with my new career around the corner. Unfortunately, my mother replied with ""It is going to be a lot on your shoulders being the sole income since you’ll be paying for a new place and the debts that you owe."" (Referring to student loans. I got a letter in the mail that she looked at explaining how to set up my auto-withdrawal once I graduate. Not to mention my seemingly never-ending debt to them). I explained to her that my girlfriend and I budgeted out everything and will be more than comfortable financially and that I did not mind her not working since I wanted her to focus on school. She just brushed it off as if she did not hear me and my dad just shook his head.

I feel like I want to separate myself from my parents once I move and restrict seeing them to only holidays, but I am afraid to lose my bother. I love him to death, but I know that my parents would manipulate him into thinking I was a bad guy for distancing myself from them. I just feel as though I am never going to be happy in the relationship with them when all they do is make me worry and their only concern is when I am going to pay off my supposed debt to them as if I’m going to just hand them the money despite our agreement.

Am I right to be wanting this though? If so, then how should I go about it? Should I cut them off completely, or just be strict with seeing them? Any suggestions overall? I am just really conflicted on what I should do, especially with my brother in the picture. I would appreciate the help. Thank you all in advance!

TL;DR: My parents won't stop holding debts over my head when they know I am going to pay them back. I feel as though the relationship is just based on money and I'm not sure if I want to be a part of it anymore.

31,"I started college this year out of state, and learned that my father, who is a professor at a large university in the US, cheated on my mother (47F) by having sex with a graduate student earlier this year. Apparently my parents are ""working it out"" but I get relatively few details because my mom doesn't want to talk about it, which I understand. 

Due to my lack of information, I worry constantly whether he is going to lose his job over this. He is the bread winner for the family, and helps pay my tuition. I know this is a selfish thought, but I am now concerned that he will be fired over his actions, especially with all of the media coverage about men abusing their power over women.

I worry about my mom, who works, but doesn't make enough to support herself on her own. Of course I am also worried about her emotional state as well and what my father did to her, but she just assures me she is doing ok and not to worry about it. 

How concerned should I be about this situation? Should I prepare for a big life change? Can people come back from this?

TL;DR- my father slept with a graduate student at his university and I am worried that he is now going to lose his job and all of us will now be impacted even further by his actions."
32,"TL;DR: I broke up with my GF, I was ok with it, months later she texted me HBD, I said thanks, she later drunkenly snapped me, removed me when I told her to call me, and now I want to talk to her in person when I (coincidentally) will be visiting school this weekend.

This was my first relationship. To sum it up:

We went to school together, I was a senior and she was a freshman. We met on a dating app the first week of my last year of classes, I invited her to a party, we hit it off, and were exclusive within two weeks. We dated until Christmas, I met her family over xmas break, it was great. 

I started having second thoughts being so far from her over break (from my home, her home is a 6hr drive, and 1.5-2hr to our school), and had a conversation with her after we got back where I said I think I wanted to end things because I didn’t want to get too attached before I had to graduate. Things almost ended there, but she was very emotional and has depression/body image issues.

I think shes a very attractive girl, but she was on antidepressants, but also had a very low libido. This made sex not as great for me as I had wished, we’d always use condoms because I didn’t think she needed to be on the pill. She wasn’t mad or against it, she just never orgasmed (from what I could tell), and it was mostly me doing most of the work. She was extremely inexperienced. We still fucked maybe 5-6 times per week.

We had continued dating until the end of the year, and a couple weeks before the end of the semester is when she finally realized I would be leaving. She cried and cried one night at a party at my buddy’s house when she was hammered, I tried to comfort her. We eventually went home and she cried in my bed until she fell asleep. We would sleep in my dorm (i was in a single) almost daily (more likely than not).

I can remember our final day together, I had seen her mother coming to help pick her stuff up from school, she finally left us so we could say goodbye, and it was hard to stop ourselves from crying. I actually went back to my dorm and realized I forgot to give her something, brought it back to her (after saying goodbye), and tried to keep it brief. After she left, I cried later that night in my room. I was really emotional, and knew that it had to be done. 

I had not wanted to do long distance, I didn’t want to expose myself to the chance that she could cheat, or that I couldn’t be there for her. I had my doubts that she was the one: sometimes she was really bad at texting. She wasn’t very good at explaining her feelings either. She would always keep her emotions bottled up inside, and would cry if she didn’t know what to say. We’d had gotten into arguments before because I told her I felt like I barely knew her — she felt boring. I don’t think she had many hobbies. Maybe fashion? I tried to get her to do things with me, and she did, but she had nothing else going on for her.

She was a smart girl, dedicated to her studies, tried to join a sorority and got rejected — while her friends (girls she was matched with to dorm) are degenerate low-lives who smoke weed and suck at school. 

She was great in so many ways. She would do anything for me. She would come to anything that I invited her to. She was always there to support me — and I would have been there for her (if she had done anything). She was my sidekick, and our families felt so alike. We were so compatible in so many ways.

Now, beyond that day, the following communications occurred: first, I texted her on her birthday. Really straightforward, to the point, nothing extensive. It was a thank you from her, we made VERY brief conversation, and she let the conversation die after I didn’t continue with a question, text etiquette — whatever - I was busy and didn’t want to lead her on. 

Now, she still likes my posts on social media, follows me, etc. We shared locations too - why not? Didn’t feel like I needed to get rid of it from our relationship (bad idea).

Fast forward to last month — it’s my birthday, she texts me HBD, the usual, and I say thanks as well! She texts me back essentially wishing me good luck with everything, and I don’t reply. I didn’t think it was necessary to send another baseless text. 

Big mistake. Later that night, she snapchats me, after not snapping me since being together. It’s her in the club, dressed up all hot, etc. I send some dumb selfie calling out that she wore sunglasses to the club, and she snaps me back. I get a reply a bit later, it’s just a snap of her back at her dorm confirming my sunglasses quip, but I don’t open/reply until the morning, in case she is hammered. 

Now, this is where I kind of mess-up. I started getting feels again after she had texted me for my birthday. Honestly, I had been great until that point. This summer I interned and was busy with work, but now i’m in grad school (away from her), and living at home. My social life is minimal. I met some new kids, but I go to a commuter school (it’s prestigious and cheap), so it’s hard to meet new people, especially when having to commute to class w/ an hour commute via train. 

 Back to the story: I (once again, stupidly) send her a snap message with two words, “call me.” DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. At the time, I was out with a family member for breakfast, actually talking about it (my ex) with her, and how I wasn’t sure if I was going to try to reconnect with her. She opened it around 11-12pm, no reply, but her name went grey, meaning she removed me from Snapchat.


At this point, I was floored. I hadn’t thought she would ever do that, considering how petty it is. I thought it might have been her friends who told her to remove me. I’m was thinking of why she would remove me, but my only guess is that my request was too direct. I probably could have not said anything and gotten a better reaction. Or maybe any reply could have gotten me removed, I don’t know. I’m guessing she got hammered, regretted snapping me, then removed me after I told her to call me. 

In hindsight, I don’t even know what a call would accomplish. Could I have poured my heart out to her? Probably. I think I justified it as to me thinking in my head “I need to tell her she has to move on, and she’ll cry wanting me back, giving me the opportunity to rekindle things.” She did this to me the day after my birthday, too.

Regardless, I removed her on social media — everything. Facebook, unfollowed and removed our photos from my instagram, snap (lol), and stopped sharing my location with her. I also removed all of her female friends. She still follows me on instagram, but stopped liking my photos after this day. I want to believe she just wants to try to move on, but would be open to listening if I were to bring up the idea of a LDR. 

She’s a very sensitive girl, which is why I don’t want to try calling her randomly, texting her huge paragraphs, and getting myself blocked because she doesn’t know how to handle it.

Like I said, this was my first relationship, but I’ve always had the idea in my mind in that whatever woman I date, it’s because I want to have them as a future wife. Not NECESSARILY this girl, but I felt like this girl could be the one i’m looking for — I just don’t know if she’s angry at me, sad with how I let her down/dropped the ball on our relationship. 

I was scared — I just wanted to think of things realistically. But so many people I know have done LDR’s and they’ve worked out — my parents, my uncles, etc. I feel like I made a mistake and I don’t know how to fix this, if even possible, without looking like a desperate fool second-guessing myself

It has been a month and a half since our last communication. I’ve been up to school since then, but didn’t reach out to her or try to make contact with her. I am going up this weekend for an irrelated event I had previously planned. This is where I’m looking for input. 

I haven’t texted, or called, this girl since then. When I broke up with her, she made it clear she wanted to stay in contact, that she’d always be there for me, and that we’d make it work. My goodbye card said with love — and I meant it. 

I want to go to her dorm and try to see if I can just talk to her. I’m 100% prepared to have the door slammed in my face, to have her say she’s moved on, to have her say she’e seeing someone else, or for her to just say she doesn’t want to try anything.

I just think I’ve made a mistake without even considering her feelings — I should have at least given her a chance to see if things would work. We’d be able to see each other on weekends, even though I’m extremely busy. 

I was fine for the months leading up to this — but now, I feel like I’m desperate, and don’t know if that’s what this is/would come across as. I thought things would have turned out differently. I had imagined her finishing school, reaching out again, and maybe trying something if we both were still single. I truly regret not giving her a chance long distance - I think that’s my main issue here. We NEVER had a conversation about it — I had my mind set and she’s not the girl who would try to make me change my mind (she would think she couldn’t).

Has this ship sailed? I haven’t been able to sleep very well, and have been thinking about this weekend. It won’t ruin my day even if things go poorly for me, i’d honestly be content with the closure if it doesn’t leas to anything. Am I crazy? Have I screwed things up? Do I have nothing to lose (besides my dignity)?"
33,"This is going to be a bit difficult to explain because i am suspecting this and not have concrete evidence like a photo or confession etc . But I have enough signs that are kind of concerning me. 

This all started as like a casual joke my friend randomly brought up that she thinks this teacher is attractive ( which is so weird because he’s really not and not even in an old man way I mean in general) the way she brought it up was kind of strange like she wanted to say something more but then say our grossed out reaction and stopped. 

From this point she started like randomly talking about him more and casually bringing up personal details that are weird for her to know that like he suffers with depression or what he studied in university and like his middle name and age etc. Just weird little things 

This was all about 6 months ago. From then she’s started hanging out with a lot after school like he stays extra to tutor her which isn’t unheard of but I don’t know she used to go to the lunch one where it was offered for all students but apparently she doesn’t learn well with others around. 

I also noticed random changes in her appearance and attitude. She started wearing red lipstick and said it’s because someone said she’d look prettt with it but wouldn’t say who. She also like has these random things that she says she bought but seem more like gifts. 

Psychologically she’s changed too, she is so obsessive over not letting anybody on her phone it’s a huge thing. One time she accidentally left it and my friend got on it and found a whole bunch of like “sexy photos” someone took of her and my friend got really embarrassed and upset. ( to be clear my friend didn’t do that to find those and didn’t expect those )

She also has been like randomly crying and like irritable and like it’s really intense and she’s crying for a reason but she won’t tell us why and all she can say is that we won’t understand and don’t know what’s going on. It makes me really upset to see her like this. But then she gets mad when I ask her about it. 

Besides these random observations their interactions are not innapropriate but given other factors a bit odd.  None of our friends are in the class she has with him but when we pass him in the halls they look at eachother weird, and when we were at this study thing where a lot of teachers help students prepare for exams, he just sat with her the whole time and she like left our table to sit with him. 

Also she has been skipping certain periods of class for like no reason and one time after this she came to the library after a “ dentist appointment” and her skirt was twisted around. This happens a lot but like when I let her know her face like went white. 


That was a lot to put down but honestly I have no idea what to do right now like these are all just suspicions and I know I can’t say anything to anyone but I really feel for my friend. Her changes are really concerning especially because they are Making her really detached and borderline depressed. 

How do I navigate this how do I be there for her regardless if this is what’s going on or if it’s something different troubling her. 

Tl;dr friends behaviour has radically changed since she has been in this teachers class she has a crush on and I’m nervous somethings going on."
34,"Okay, first of all, I’m aware this is going to sound so petty. But it genuinely makes me really depressed and anxious. So my ex(M20) and I(F21) broke up a year ago and I’m over him. However, since we broke up he’s begun to frequently use social media which makes his life look so much better than mine. Just recently he posted an album on facebook of his summer where he was doing all these fun things and looking adorable with his new girlfriend. We have mutual friends on Facebook and I’m worried that they’re going to think badly of me when they see him living his best life with a new girlfriend already and my life’s pretty mediocre and I’m still single. Also he broke up with me so I feel like I’ve lost the break up. Also I’m a bit bitter because I improved my ex so much when we were together and all my friends said I could do better than him but I stayed with him. When we met he had a strong foreign accent and a stammer which I spent ages working on with him to fix and now he speaks fine. He was also not very confident which I helped him with and now he is. He didn’t have any hobbies so I introduced him to playing tennis which he now loves and that’s how he met his new girlfriend. I helped him with his studies and got him into a better university which is also where he met his new girlfriend. I cut his hair which made him look more attractive as he used to have very long hair. And then when he was more confident and a better version of himself( thanks to me) he dumps me over the phone. He didn’t improve me at all during the relationship. He almost stunted my growth. I did less because I was spending time with him, I saw my friends less because when we were together he didn’t have any friends so he needed to spend all his time with me. And then after the break up I was depressed for ages and my grades suffered. Meanwhile on social media he looked like he was partying loads and having the time of his life. He clearly did not care. He would literally be nowhere without me, why does he get to be so happy and I’m not? And am I being stupid to worry about what our mutual friends will think? I just worry that they’ll think badly of me when they see I’m so replaceable and how happy he is without me? 

Tl;dr my ex looks like he has the perfect life on social media since we broke up. Why does he get to be happier than me?"
35,"My boyfriend \[23M\] and I \[20F\] have been together for about a year and have recently been considering marriage. We both take this very seriously and have been talking about all the factors that play into it, and how we would adapt to such a serious commitment. We have agreed that marriage is definitely what we want to come from our love for each other, and although there is no rush we still would prefer for it to be in the sooner future than the later future. He has even admitted to me that he has picked out a ring for me and is just awaiting for the moment he can afford to start making payments. Our relationship is special in so many aspects, but mainly because we have lived together since our third month of dating. I believe this has made us grow closer together than we would have if we didn't make that decision to live together so soon.

Now this is where my dad comes into play. My dad has helped me with everything in my life and have given me anything I could have ever needed and wanted. I am currently still in school and since my family makes too much money for me to qualify for financial aid, my dad (who owns a successful company) has offered to help me pay for my school and provide a place for me to live, which I am so grateful for. Ever since my relationship started with my boyfriend, he has stressed the fact that he does not want me to get married anytime soon, but recently he has been more strict on that. He told me a few weeks ago that he would buy me a new car, (for my birthday and because my current one can't get me to school in bad weather) but I had to promise him that I don't get married. I cried for hours when he said that to me. He said he doesn't want me to because he doesn't want me to be tied down. I told him I am in a relationship already so I am tied down already, but he just doesn't understand what I am saying.  Keep in mind that him and my mom got pregnant in high school at 16, and married at 17, have been happily together for 26 years now, and are very successful.

My whole life I have felt like I have been living for my dad. It started in sports as a kid, and grew into academics, and now this. He has always guilted me and manipulated me into doing things for him because if I didn't this or that would be a consequence. One time when I quit basketball he stopped talking to me for 4 months, and our relationship changed since then.  I want to live my life for me and be truly happy, but I am terrified that he will cut me off and I will be forced to dropout of school because I can't afford it. I know marriage isn't a necessity in this case, but this whole issue is really weighing on my relationship with my SO, it is causing him to resent my dad and me to be put in an awkward situation with my family. It is not like I want to get married tomorrow, but if my SO got down on one knee tomorrow I don't want to feel like I have to say no. 

* How can I talk to my dad about this without causing a screaming match? 
* How can I get my dad to understand how I am feeling?
* Can anyone shed some light on what he may be thinking so I can understand him? (without being rude)

TLDR; My dad hates the fact that I want to get married. He is guilting me into doing as he says or I will get cut off financially, including school. It's putting stress on my life, and in my relationships with my family and SO. I need help figuring out how to convince my dad that me getting married won't ruin my whole life."
36,"I have been at this company since I graduated from college 2 years ago, but have switched around departments throughout.  I’ve only been able to get junior staff positions which have gone from intern to next level up but a title that no one outside of this company would understand.  So essentially a glorified intern.  While I’m VERY fortunate to have a job in a field I love, I often feel like I do WAY more than my job title (sometimes equivalent to my higher paid coworkers) and it goes unacknowledged. 

I have been turned down two times for full time positions at the division I first interned for, but have been able to maintain a part time presence there while working my other junior level position in another department full time.  I don’t understand why I’m getting passed up when everyone likes me, I do good work, and I am qualified for these positions.  It’s very disheartening and often leaves me feeling like maybe there’s something they don’t like about me that no one is telling me? 

My other job, the junior level but more consistent one (9-5) is great except I feel like my male bosses are constantly overlooking what me and my other junior staff coworker do.  Often I’ll write something that winds up in a pitch deck for a client and when I get excited that they picked my idea he says “well I re-wrote it, so it’s probably way different now.”  I know he doesn’t mean to sound demeaning, but often it comes off that way.  I can’t help but feel like I’m at a disadvantage because I’m a woman also.. all of the late 30s early 40s male employees hold the better titles and are included more in office chats/jokes.  There are so many times it has felt like a total boys club.  Not to mention a part time employee they were looking to take on full time has called my input “rants.”  I brought it up to my boss, and I get it it’s not the biggest deal but still not cool, and my boss told me to communicate better with him and then proceeded to hire him full time.  

I can’t tell if I’m just being victim-y here or if I have legitimate reasons to feel like I’m being pushed out??  I know I’m only 2 years out of school and can’t get the titles my older coworkers have, but I think I should still be considered for a step above what I have now.  I work really hard and my work is often used, what am I doing wrong here 

TLDR: I (24f) feel like I’m getting overlooked for jobs I’m qualified for.  My coworkers/bosses (40s m) don’t acknowledge my contributions and make my work out to be far less important than theirs.  I feel stuck."
37,"Buckle up, it's gonna be a long one.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend(we'll call her K) and I have always had what I considered to be a near-perfect relationship. I've known her for 12 years, we've been together for 6, living together for two. We were initially long distance, and then in 2017 I moved in with her in Texas (I was in Virginia). She's been my best friend, my soulmate, and the person I thought I was going to marry and be with forever.

And then I lost my mom, whom I was very close with, in July to cancer, three weeks after diagnosis, and my world turned upside down. I've been in Virginia since late June, staying in my mom's house with my two sisters, because one of them is disabled, mom was her primary caregiver, and we're trying to find housing for her. This is the one time in our lives where I really needed my partner to step up emotionally, and in all honestly I feel let down.  We've been fighting on and off nearly all summer, and it's made me realize that there have been red flags throughout the entirety of our relationship that I never really acknowledged before.

Let's start with the day mom died. It was the day before my birthday. I called K, she comforted me, and that all went fine. The next day was my birthday, and she...sent me a bunch of pictures of stuff she went out and bought for herself, which I found really insensitive and tacky? I had friends and family send cards, gifts, etc. but I got nothing from her for my birthday, the hardest birthday of my life. I did get a shirt later(which matched one she got for herself and she was sure to tell me the price of) and a card when I visited her in September, but I still felt hurt.

In August, I asked her to mail me my antidepressants. A week went by. I ran out, and then she messaged me saying she wasn't going to mail them at all(because ""it's illegal and she has a government job""). I had a full blown meltdown and we had a big blowout over it, and then I got days of coldness and passive aggression until her mother actually mailed them to me. Then we were mostly okay, because I apologized.

When I went home to visit her 2 weeks later, as happy as I was to see her and go back to my life as it was before all this, by the end of the 3 or 4 days I was there I felt agitated and frustrated with my life with her. I brought back a few things from my mom's house and before I even unpacked anything she asked me if anything was ""debatable"", like I'd be willing to throw away anything that was my mother's(promised to me by her) that I just put on a plane and flew to Texas with. She doesn't understand the value of sentimental items, and has thrown out things my mom gave her(while pressuring me to do the same) because she didn't like them and coming from a sentimental family it hurts a lot, especially now that mom is gone. She's also tried to get me to get rid of things sent to me by friends even when it was really clear that those things were special to me and I didn't want to, also because she didn't like them. I feel like my living space isn't really mine sometimes because she fights me on the littlest things like pot holders and where I can put them. I couldn't even buy the kind of food I wanted to get my cat because it was pricier and she'd ""rather I spend the money on her"".

She's over $10,000 in credit card debt. Most of which was spent on video game stuff and porn. She got a 2k bonus from work recently which she told me she was going to use to get her car serviced. It's gone already. I know this because the other day she got one of her tires replaced and asked me to pay for it, even though I've left my job to come out here to VA and she makes 42k a year. She told my sister she was going to use that money to get me an engagement ring, and I know that didn't happen either. We've been talking about getting engaged for 2 years.

On top of this, she sexts with other people regularly. Nothing romantic, but sexually explicit messages between she and her friends as well as nude photos. I am oftentimes woken up in the middle of the night to the bed shaking because she's masturbating to someone else, next to me in the bed we share. It makes me ill. There's kind of a loophole with this one, because I've allowed it to continue and given her my approval, but in all honesty it feels like I never really did give her my consent because she's be doing this throughout the duration of our relationship. I never really had a say. The only reason I even know about it now is because I saw the messages after I moved in, and the only reason I let it go on after I found out is because I feel like if I asked her to stop she'd do it anyway or blame me for not saying anything sooner. She didn't consider me before any of this started happening.

And that is ultimately the crux of all this- I feel that she is really self centered. I've poured all my social energy in talking to her while I've been away and I'm met with half-assed one word replies if it's not about her. We never really talk, and when we do I feel like I'm either ignored, talked over, or lectured. My friends who have interacted with her get the same vibe.

I'm conflicted here. In the 2 years I've lived with her, there's been a lot of good. We've laughed so much together and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. It really is the standard ""when it's good it's great!"". I know that in spite of being self absorbed, she's not malicious and she genuinely does love and care about me. We know everything about each other. I know that I haven't been the perfect partner either, and I'm probably not giving her enough credit here for the good she does do. But I feel like no matter what, I'm the one that always has to apologize for the bad. All this time I thought it was me that was the problem, but I've talked to friends and family about this and the unanimous consensus is that I deserve better and need to leave. I'd never even considered that before this summer. I feel like as soon as I try she's going to flip a switch that makes me appear completely unreasonable. All this time I've been quietly saying to myself that I'd never be with anyone else but her because I'm not cut out for relationships and incapable of compromise, but I'm realizing now that it's all I do.

I don't really know why I'm here. Maybe I just needed to vent, but it'd be nice to have a perspective on this that is a neutral third party and not friends/family of mine. I just want to be fair to her- and to myself, I guess.

**TL;DR - I've realized that the person I thought was my soulmate is likely self centered beyond repair and my life is falling apart. Am I in the wrong?**"
38,"Hi reddit, 

I’m having trouble with establishing my adulthood to my parents, especially my mother.

I consider myself to be super independent. I fully support myself financially (paying for college, phone bill, credit card, transportation, food, etc). The only thing my parents pay on my behalf is rent. I make enough money that I could move out, however, I feel as though they would be against that idea, so I haven’t even brought it up. My parents are imposing a ton of rules on me and passing judgment when it comes to my social life, in particular. They’re super traditional and I am not, so we clash a lot. They don’t like when I don’t sleep at home, nor when I come home late (past midnight basically). They think I’m out getting wasted at clubs, sleeping around and doing drugs - none of which are true. I feel like they think I’m doing it to spite them, but really I just have so much I’m juggling that I try to squeeze things into my schedule wherever I can. I do like to go out and have fun. I have a boyfriend that I dedicate a lot of time to as well. My schedule doesn’t have as much “sit at home and do nothing” as my parents would probably like. 

I will point out that my mother got married at 22. I am will be 22 soon but nowhere near that point in my life, but she is convinced that I am going to get pregnant, drop out of college, and elope. How do I kindly tell her to chill out? How do I make her see I’m an actual adult? I’m feeling very discredited, when I’m actually a very responsible person. I feel pretty good about my life decisions, and everything I have going on (school, work, relationship) is going smoothly. Just wish home life was too. 

TLDR: I don’t know what to do about my strict, overprotective parents that refuse to believe I am an adult and don’t trust that I am making good choices for myself. The worst thing I do is come home late pretty often and have occasional sleep overs (every few months), and they pretty much hate me for it."
39,"I know this may sound childish, and I don’t want to sound like a crybaby, but I’ve never kissed a girl and I feel ashamed of it. I know it’s really not that important but it does get to me sometimes. 
It’s not like I just don’t talk to girls at all, I talk to them plenty in school, make them laugh and all, but they’re never interested in me. Could be that I have a baby face, or that I’m 5’6”.  How can I change this and should I? Or is it better to just wait?

tl;dr: teenager and never kissed a girl, looking for advice"
40,"I'm struggling on how to write and feel about it, I think a lot of my discomfort over this is related to my own privileges. I'm Brazilian, in my country I'm considered 'white' and I'm aware this gave me a lot of privileges growining up and probably one of the main things was that I never had to care about my race... Nobody expected things from me due to my race. I wasn't a white person, I was just a person. 

3 years ago, I moved to Italy. I have two grandparents who are from Italy (other two are from Portugal and Lithuania), so I have citizenship. I really felt like I fit in here too. Obviously, when you meet new people they have some curiosity about my home country but is very rare someone will obsess over it and I feel like someone is pressuring me into an stereotype. 

Until I started dating this guy from Norway. We are dating for a little over two months, I like him... but I feel very weird because sometimes he talks about us being in an interracial relationship and he seems to make a deal out of it, like it's some relevant fact in our relation while aren't we the same race? even if we weren't, should it really be a thing? He loves to remarks how my interests and personality aren't fit for my home country, that is so exotic for someone from my 'background' have similar interests with him... I'm just a person, I'm not obligated to enjoy football and be an extrovert just because I was born somewhere. He doesn't say it to put me down, but I don't like to be classified as something just because I was born in a certain place. 

I have no idea how to deal with that, or how should I feel about my own identity. This is really holding me back in investing more on him because I don't want to deal with this feeling of being 'exotic'. I have no idea if I should and how should I talk about it to him? is this feeling normal in an inter-cultural relationship? 

TL;DR: white brazilian of mostly southern european origin dating a norwegian guy and i feel weird about his remarks of us being from a different race and me being exotic."
41,"A little back story- I moved into our place with my roommate [23M] in July. Our house is divided into two apartments, so our door is right next to our neighbor’s. My neighbor (we’ll call him Ed) was pretty mobile at this point. He’s constantly on oxygen but he could move around pretty well, hold a conversation, and offered to bring in our packages for us whenever we weren’t home. 

From July-beginning of October, he was pretty independent from what I saw. We help him bring in his groceries and put them in his fridge for him (he gets them delivered every week) and he has both of our numbers saved in his phone. He’s called me a few time for minor favors, but nothing huge. 

This past week, I get a call from Ed and he asks if my roommate or I am available because he can’t get his pants up. I ask my roommate if he can help him, and when my roommate gets back, he tells me that Ed’s apartment smells rancid and that he mentioned that he hasn’t left the couch for a few days. 

This morning I get woken up to my lights getting flashed on, and I hear my roommate explaining to 911 that our neighbor is yelling for help from his apartment. I immediately get the spare key to his apartment (which we got made after he needed our help the first time) and we go and open his door. We find Ed in a puddle of his own urine, sprawled out on the floor, and unable to sit up. He had shaken him self off the couch while asleep and couldn’t get up. He had been there all night, and as my roommate was leaving for work he heard him yelling. 

The paramedics show up and ask him what he wants them to do, and Ed looks at me and says “where should they move me?” I felt immediately uncomfortable. I suggested that he gets moved wherever most of his stuff (medications, phone, etc) was. The medics pulled me and my roommate aside and asked us more questions about Ed and tell us that he shouldn’t be living alone. When they left, Ed told us that he didn’t realize he was wearing his life alert necklace and that OUR numbers were programmed in it for emergencies. 

I helped him take his meds and get a drink of water, as well as set up a place for him to sleep before leaving. I had been there for 2 hours and needed to get to work. When I got home from work, he asked me to come in and I realized he had pissed himself again and hadn’t left the couch for 8 hours. He couldn’t even sit up. 

Ed has basically no family, and he told me that he thinks it’s so wonderful we’re his neighbors. He’s asked us to check up on him periodically now. 

I feel guilty every time i walk past his door. I know he needs help getting food, water, etc, and I think he should go into assisted living immediately, but he won’t hear of it. How can I help him by getting him the help he needs? 

TLDR: my neighbor is very disabled and needs a full time nurse but is relying on me to take care of him lately. I feel immense guilt every time I walk past his door and don’t check up on him

UPDATE:

I called the nonemergency number and they’re doing a welfare check tonight on him."
42,"I have had no sexual or serious relationships before this relationship, which I've been in for a year. When I first met my boyfriend, one big issue for him was complete honesty, and this included divulging whether or not he had sex with someone whenever the person was mentioned in a story. He also admitted to having a friends-with-benefits relationship shortly before we met. I wasn't wise enough to ask that he not share details about these partners, and I wanted to be seen as ""chill"" since his last relationship ended because his ex was an incredibly jealous and controlling person and was upset that he dared to have female co-workers and classmates. I didn't want him to think I was anything like that, but I did not realize how much these stories would hurt me.

I'm sorry, but the next part is going to be a bit too personal for some people, so exit now if that isn't for you.

For his friends-with-benefits partner, he admitted that it was the best sex he ever had, and included details about the sex that made me INCREDIBLY self-conscious. I have the Devil's trifecta of depression, anxiety, and body image hate. I feel like I will never live up to this sexual experience despite my bf's assurances that I have blown everyone out of the water. I trust him, but my depression brain has a hard time having anything but low self esteem. He said they gave each other oiled massages, edging, and went at it five times during the night all night long. I am extremely self conscious because he barely lasts five minutes with me. He claims this is because sex is so much more intense with me (ah, I am embarrassed to speak plainly here, but maybe you get the idea?). This has been detrimental in other ways, because it was months before I stopped lying about reaching orgasm and started expressing my own needs. He teased about exchanging erotic massages before I finally opened up that it felt like he wasn't actually wanting to try this with me. I am now worried sick that he felt manipulated into giving me a massage. The only time we had sex more than once in a night was the same scenario, and I am worried that he also felt manipulated into doing this because he seemed rather unenthusiastic about it. I have stopped bringing up things I want to try in the bedroom.

I guess I should also mentioned that these stories made me feel pressured to have sex with him a lot sooner than I would have wished for a serious relationship (I was hoping to wait 4-6 months, we started having sex before we were ""official""), and to let him not use a condom. I have a tendency to read too much into the meaning of people's words. I have waited a long time to find someone like my boyfriend, and he is very patient and understanding, and I know he is not using these stories to coerce me to do anything. I have difficulty telling him about things that upset me because I am worried I am coercing him, and also because I don't want to hurt him the same way his ex hurt him. 

My low self esteem is getting so out of hand, I had to request that he never ever give me identifying information about the women he has slept with in case I met someone with a similar description. Sometimes he will mention someone completely inocuous, ie a funny story about a girl farting on a guy when he gave her a massage on their first date, and it will remind me of one of those stories that I should never have heard in the first place. I'll start spiraling out of control and it will keep me up all night. I may not be a jealous girlfriend, but his jealous ex had her issues because of her insecurity. My insecurity stems not from mistrust, but rather inadequacy. I am also insecure that our sex life is insincere, because whenever I am honest about my insecurity, I am worried that he tries harder to meet my needs because I manipulated him to do so.

TLDR; boyfriend disclosed way too much information about past sexual encounters, and they make me feel insecure. How to I change my perspective so these stories don't affect me or our relationship so much? In other words, how do I be ""chill"" about it."
43,"We've been together for 10 months. It might be relevant to know that he was in a relationship with my a good friend of mine before we got together. They split when he found out that she had been having a second boyfriend for almost a year. I (and the rest of our friends) stopped being friends with her when we discovered that she was a compulsive liar (about huge things, like abortions or cancer), and none of us have contact with her anymore. We got together two years after their relationship ended. He had been trying to get together with me almost a year before that, but I didn't want to be a rebound for him and also didn't know how to feel about dating my ex-good-friend's ex-boyfriend (even given the history). So anyway, we got together. We didn't tell our mutual circle of friends until after a few months had passed. I don't like sneaking around, but we never addressed it. Finally I told them. 

Almost my entire circle of friends are also his friends. I knew them before him, but he became all of our friend when we lived in the same dorm. He has many other friends. I have one good friend outside these friends we share. 

The friends we have in common know about our relationship, my one other friend, let's call her Sarah, knows too. His, I am not sure. 

Ever since I told Sarah, she has been inviting him to come along, when we have dinner at her place, when we go out to dinner, when she is celebrating her birthday, when her bf was celebrating his birthday. She knows him from before, she has met him when I invited them both to my place (usually when our other friends are also there), but he has never once managed to come with me when she invited us both. Often he has a good excuse (he works long hours) but sometimes it feels like he doesn't really want to. Like Sarah's boyfriend's birthday dinner was a very spontaneous plan. They invited us about noon for dinner in a restaurant that night. I told my bf. He said he would come if he had the time. He didn't come, didn't even ask where we were, and told me later when I asked that he had to help is roommate with a legal problem that couldn't wait. (An employment contract. He is a lawyer). 

Like I said, I don't know if his friend's know, and at this point I'm not sure how to ask. It's been 10 months. Maybe they know and he thinks I know they know. It would only be natural. But he has never once invited me out to join him and his friends when they go out for a beer, when he is invited to a birthday party etc. There were two occasions were friends of him saw us together (always with our other friends too), but his behaviour would never have given away that we are in a relationship (no kiss or handholding). 

I also don't know if his parents know, but his mother is not doing well health-wise so I don't want to push that. She is in constant pain and it doesn't seem like the right time to introduce someone new. 

I told my parents. When I celebrated my birthday with my step-mum and sister I invited him twice. Two days before the celebration he said: ""So you don't have time do do anything on Saturday night, right?"" I did not repeat my invitation at that point because it was starting to piss me off. My dad would also like to meet him.  I told him so multiple times, didn't get much of a reaction.

Tonight he is out with I assume his friends (?). In our friend-group-chat, someone asked who had time to do something tonight and he said he had dinner plans already. We spent yesterday evening together, we wrote each other multiple times during the day, but that was the first I've heard of it. Isn't it normal to share plans? Like even if he doesn't want to ask me along, isn't it normal to mention this in conversation? I guess this pisses me off because most of the time doesn't tell me about his plans at all or only when I ask what he's doing this week etc., or he tells me very last minute. And I guess this only annoys me as much because he never asks me to come along. 

So my question is, what do you think about his and my behaviour? Am I acting reasonably? Is he? What do you expect of your partner, do you expect them to tell you about their plans etc. or is it normal that you don't share plans that don't involve each other? I don't expect like an exact schedule and have no problem with him going out or anything, I just feel like sharing your life and plans is also part of a relationship. 

Tldr: Boyfriend and I share common circle of friends who know about our relationship. My one other friend does too.  I don't know if his other friends know because he never invites me along, never mentions telling them or anything like it. When I invite him along to meet my other friend or my family he never makes it. What do you make of this? How much of their life do you expect your partner to share?"
44,"I'm not accusing her of anything or saying she's a bad person because she's not, but there are things on my mind that might not sound nice if I ask her about out loud.

She has 2 kids from a previous relationship which she had waited 3 months to tell me about. She said it was hard dating with 2 kids which I can understand, it took some adjusting but I'm fine with it now.

Now I have always wanted kids of my own but I feel conflicted because if we do have one, 3 is a lot of kids to me and I don't know how having a baby would affect her daughters.

She's been pushing for it for 2 months now and I honestly don't know if its because she actually wants one or just wants to make sure I'll stay with her. She's talked a lot about how lonely she was and how hard it was being on her own.

I only thought about this because I do make a lot of money (I'm not rich by any means) and I'm just trying to be cautious because in the past I have had women use me for it.

How would i go about addressing my concerns?

TL;DR my girlfriend wants to have a kid with me but I'm not sure If that's what she really wants."
45,"I have the opportunity to study abroad at a great 4 year college where I have family and I planned on moving over there at some point anyways. My boyfriend wants to move with me (which i’m soo happy about!) partly because he’s sick of the area, his friends aren’t the best and his home life is pretty abusive emotionally. I know my folks there would be welcoming to him too, they’re all really nice! 


The thing is that a year ago he chose to work full time and then he is going to take his last year of college after THAT, and I don’t know if I can wait two whole years to move and then start a four year college degree. He can’t start the last year of school now because it starts at a specific term and he’d need to wait next year anyways. I’ll stay a year anyways to save up for the move, but i’m not sure what should happen after that, we could do long distance as i’d like to think were a strong couple but I’d feel so bad for leaving him hanging here still for a year, I know he doesn’t want me to leave without him though. 


He is about to move in with my mom and I to get out of his crappy home life and terrible parents too. and if I moved out of the country while he was stil living with us, my mom likes him but she wouldn’t be comfortable with him living here without me which is understandable. she mentioned possibly charging him higher rent if I were gone but it hasn’t been discussed a lot (she knows about the terrible treatment at his house). I would feel horrible if he had to live with his parents again while were apart for a year. I’ve talked with a friend about this and they said that I shouldn’t care about that and put my goals first, which I understand to an extent,  but I care about him.


Another thing is that my dad in the country i’m moving to is putting alot of pressure on me to move asap!! I think he is just anxious for me to be there, and wants me to get an education while i’m young which I understand. My friends also say to not listen to either of my dad or boyfriend. I’m gonna go to the college no matter what, it’s just a matter of when.


 I feel so conflicted, I don’t want to make my boyfriend wait for me and I know he’d be devastated about it, but I also don’t want to put my life on hold for two years because of his work/school decisions. Not sure what kind of living situation he’d be in if i’m gone before he can move with me and that worries me too. 


TLDR; it’s either I wait 2 years and we can move together over there, or I leave in a year and we go long distance for the rest of the time until he can move out to me? getting pressure to move asap from my dad too"
46,"Even writing this feels like a betrayal. I am absolutely in love with my partner of 5 years. Our relationship is as close to perfect as I can imagine and I want to spend the rest of my life with this person. We have the same life goals and values. I find myself day dreaming throughout the day about how much I appreciate and love him. 

However I don’t find him attractive anymore. Its truly awful to admit and really makes me inconsolably sad when i think about it. There are days when I do find him attractive but the longer we’re together the less they occur. 

I still enjoy sex and we have in regularly because I love him but there no passion from attraction there anymore. 

My question is at 27 is this the natural result of a long term relationship? Is this something that you give up to be with your perfect person, as ‘looks’ go in the end anyway? 

I sometimes day dream about being with someone passionately, someone i’m more attracted to but at the same time I truly don’t want to be with anyone else but my partner.

TL;DR I love my partner and do not want to breakup, but I do not find them physically attractive anymore."
47,"When I first met my partner he told me he was on a weight loss journey and doing very well. I grew fond of him and we began dating. He was overweight, but not terribly so, and had lost about 20 lbs maybe by that point. So, as far as I knew, his weight was an issue for him but something he was able and willing to overcome.

Fast forward a year, and he's no longer losing weight. He is upset and *extremely* sensitive about this, because he actually began to get bigger. He tried a diet, he tried exercising (his parents own a gym and are personal trainers, so he can go for free) but he decided he didn't care about ""being fat"". I know for certain this is how he feels, because he told me. 

I was shocked... I mean, I thought he wanted to be a healthy size and that it was important to him and he just up and decides he doesn't care anymore? 

But I would never shame him. And love is more than physical attraction - things slowed down in the bedroom, but a few pounds won't break a relationship. Except...

Now he's even bigger. He's bigger, and very upset and sensitive about it, and now I feel like he expects me to make up for what he's begun to lack in self-esteem. He wants me to be more aggressively affectionate with him - keep in mind, that the issue is not that I'm not affectionate, but that I'm not affectionate *enough*. 

Also... I feel like he blames me for him gaining weight. You see, I'm actually underweight. So I don't care at all about what I eat and I'm trying to gain weight. So when my partner and I spend time together, if he asks me what I want, I'll tell him and we get it. Then after the fact, he'll tell me I can't let him eat so much, we need to be more responsible, etc etc. And I'm like yeah that's okay for you but I'm don't want to diet!

I feel like he's projecting his insecurity about his weight onto me. And it's impossible to work through because any mention of his weight is met with a meltdown and extreme negative feelings. I want him to be happy and comfortable but... I don't know if it's fair for him to expect me to build up his self-esteem, which was tanked because of his own decisions. But, again... any mention of his weight is forbidden, so how can I even discuss this?

I feel like what he wants is to lose weight. But he doesn't want to put in the work, so he's settled for blaming me for his low sense of self-worth, and assigning me the task of building it back up. I don't want to break-up, but I'm at my wit's end with this ish.

I don't know what to say or how to help without him lashing out at me. Advice welcome.

TL;DR: Partner continues to gain weight and is now angry at me for not doing more to make him feel comfortable in his skin and loved."
48,"First off this is my first redit post so I apologize if I make some mistakes 

But anyways, I'm having an issue with a guy I work with, I like him and I think he's really cute, and I'm almost positive he likes me as well because on top of just some light flirting he does things like only wearing cologne when he works with me (I've asked a few other coworker if he does when they work together/ come in early for a shift and he wasn't wearing any) and offered to let me use his washer when I mentioned not having one and not our coworker after she had complained about wasting money at the laundromat, just things like that. And my mom mentioned that he seemed a little nervous when he ran into her at her work and introduced himself. But I asked him to be my date to my moms wedding and he agreed but later backed out cause he felt like he'd be uncomfortable not knowing anyone and tbh I don't blame him for that because I've been there and it is extremely uncomfortable. At this point my friends and I have determined that maybe something that's holding him back is that he's 28 and I'm 18 which is somewhat understandable although I have no issue with the age gap and from a maturity standpoint I do consider myself more mature for my age at least compared to other 18 year olds around here and I've had to deal with things like raising children (not my own)

I'd like some advice on how to go about asking him if that's what the issue is and if he is in fact interested in me?



TL;DR! I like my coworker and I think he likes me but is put off by a 10 year age gap between us"
49,"My father is imprisoned for attempted murder and robbery, I've never met him in person and I don't really want to. He is due to be released from prison pretty soon and my mom wants him to come live with us.



I told her I don't want to live with him because I've never met him and I don't feel safe but she said it's not my decision. So I talked to an aunt and she agreed to let me live with her and even pay for my stuff until I turn 18. I thought this would solve everything, but my mom is saying she wants us to be a family and won't allow me to move with my aunt. How do I convince her?

tl;dr: My father is a criminal and I don't want to live with him, mom doesn't care about my feelings and won't let me move out"
50,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
51,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
52,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
53,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
54,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
55,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
56,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
57,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
58,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
59,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
60,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
61,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
62,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
63,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
64,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
65,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
66,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
68,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
69,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
70,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
71,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
72,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
73,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
74,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
75,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
76,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
77,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
79,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
80,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
81,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
82,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
83,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
84,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
85,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
86,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
87,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
88,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
89,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
90,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
91,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
93,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
94,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
95,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
96,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
97,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
98,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
99,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
100,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
101,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
102,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
103,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
104,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
105,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
106,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
107,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
108,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
109,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
110,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
111,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
112,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
114,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
115,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
116,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
118,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
119,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
120,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
121,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
122,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
123,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
124,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
125,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
126,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
127,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
128,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
129,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
130,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
131,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
133,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
134,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
135,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
136,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
137,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
138,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
139,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
140,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
141,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
143,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
144,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
145,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
146,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
147,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
148,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
149,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
150,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
151,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
152,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
153,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
154,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
155,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
156,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
157,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
158,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
159,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
160,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
161,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
162,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
163,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
164,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
165,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
166,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
168,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
169,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
170,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
171,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

172,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
173,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
174,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
175,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
176,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
177,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
178,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
179,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
180,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
181,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
182,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
183,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
184,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
185,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
186,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
187,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
188,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
189,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
190,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
191,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
193,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
194,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
195,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
196,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
197,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
198,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

199,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

200,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
201,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
202,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
203,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
204,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
205,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
206,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
207,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
208,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
209,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
210,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
211,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
212,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
214,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
215,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
216,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
218,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
219,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
220,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
221,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
222,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
223,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
224,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
225,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
226,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
227,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
229,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
230,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
231,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
232,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
233,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
234,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
235,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
236,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
237,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
238,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
239,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
240,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
241,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
243,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
244,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
245,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
246,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
247,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
248,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
249,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
250,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
251,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
252,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
253,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
254,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
255,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
256,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
257,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
258,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
259,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
260,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
261,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
262,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
264,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
265,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
266,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
268,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
269,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
270,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
271,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
272,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
273,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
274,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
275,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
276,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
277,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
278,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
279,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
280,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
281,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
283,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
284,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
285,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
286,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
287,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
288,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
289,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
290,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
291,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
293,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."

I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
295,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
296,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
297,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
298,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
299,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
300,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
301,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
302,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
303,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
304,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
305,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
306,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
307,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
308,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
309,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
310,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
311,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
312,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
313,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
314,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
315,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
316,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
318,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
319,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
320,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
321,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
322,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
323,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
324,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
325,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
326,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
327,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
328,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
329,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
330,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
331,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
332,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
333,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
334,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
335,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
336,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
337,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
338,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
339,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
340,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
341,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
343,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
344,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
345,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
346,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
347,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
348,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

349,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

350,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
351,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
352,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
353,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
354,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
355,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
356,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
357,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
358,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
359,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
360,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
361,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
362,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
364,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
365,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
366,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
368,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
369,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
370,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
371,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
372,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
373,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
374,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
375,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
376,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
377,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
379,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
380,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
381,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
382,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
383,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
384,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
385,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
386,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
387,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
389,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
390,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
391,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
393,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
394,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
395,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
396,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
397,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
398,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
399,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
400,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
401,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
402,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
403,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
404,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
405,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
406,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
407,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
408,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
409,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
410,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
411,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
412,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
414,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
415,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
416,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
418,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
419,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
420,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
421,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
422,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
423,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
424,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
425,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
426,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
427,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
428,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
429,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
430,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
431,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
433,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
434,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
435,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
436,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
437,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
438,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
439,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
440,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
441,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
443,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."

I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
445,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
446,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
447,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
448,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
449,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
450,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
451,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
452,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
453,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
454,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
455,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
456,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
457,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
458,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
459,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
460,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
461,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
462,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
463,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
464,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
465,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
466,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
468,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
469,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
470,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
471,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
472,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
473,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
474,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
475,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
476,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
477,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
478,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
479,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
480,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
481,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
482,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
483,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
484,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
485,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
486,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
487,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
488,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
489,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
490,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
491,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
493,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
494,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
495,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
496,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
497,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
498,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

499,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

500,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
501,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
502,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
503,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
504,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
505,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
506,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
507,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
508,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
509,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
510,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
511,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
512,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
514,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
515,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
516,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
518,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
519,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
520,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
521,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
522,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
523,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
524,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
525,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
526,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
527,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
529,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
530,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
531,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
532,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
533,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
534,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
535,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
536,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
537,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
539,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
540,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
541,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
543,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
544,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
545,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
546,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
547,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
548,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
549,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
550,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
551,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
552,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
553,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
554,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
555,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
556,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
557,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
558,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
559,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
560,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
561,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
562,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
564,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
565,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
566,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
568,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
569,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
570,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
571,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
572,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
573,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
574,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
575,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
576,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
577,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
578,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
579,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
580,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
581,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
583,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
584,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
585,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
586,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
587,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
588,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
589,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
590,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
591,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
593,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."

I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
595,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
596,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
597,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
598,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
599,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
600,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
601,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
602,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
603,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
604,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
605,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
606,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
607,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
608,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
609,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
610,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
611,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
612,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
613,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
614,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"
615,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
616,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
618,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
619,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
620,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
621,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
622,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
623,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
624,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
625,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
626,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
627,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
628,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
629,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
630,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
631,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
632,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
633,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
634,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
635,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
636,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
637,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
639,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
641,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
642,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
643,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
644,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
645,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
646,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
647,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
648,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

650,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
651,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers.

When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
652,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
653,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
654,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
655,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
656,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
657,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
658,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
659,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
660,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
661,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
662,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
664,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
666,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
667,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
668,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
669,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
670,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
671,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
672,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
673,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
674,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
675,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
676,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
677,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
679,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
680,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
681,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
682,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
683,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
684,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
685,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
686,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
689,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
691,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
692,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
693,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
694,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
695,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
696,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
697,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
698,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
699,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
700,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
701,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
702,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
703,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
704,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
705,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
706,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
707,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
708,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
709,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
710,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
711,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
712,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
714,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
716,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
717,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
718,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
719,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
720,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
721,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
722,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
723,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
724,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
725,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
726,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
727,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
728,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
729,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
730,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
731,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
733,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
734,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
735,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
736,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
737,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
738,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
739,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
741,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
742,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
743,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."

I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
745,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
746,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
747,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
748,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
749,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
750,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
751,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
752,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
753,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
754,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
755,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
756,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
757,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
758,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
759,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
760,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
761,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
762,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
763,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
764,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
766,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
767,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
768,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
769,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
770,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

771,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
772,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
773,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
774,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
775,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
776,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
777,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
778,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
779,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
780,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
781,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
782,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
783,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
784,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
785,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
786,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
787,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
789,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
791,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
792,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
793,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
794,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
795,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
796,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
797,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
798,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

800,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
801,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers.

When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
802,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
803,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
804,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
805,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
806,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
807,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
808,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
809,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
810,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
811,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
812,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
814,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
816,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
817,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
818,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
819,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
820,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
821,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
822,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
823,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
824,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
825,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
826,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
827,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
829,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
830,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
831,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
832,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
833,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
834,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
835,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
836,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

837,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
839,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
841,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
842,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
843,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
844,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
845,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
846,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
847,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
848,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
849,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
850,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
851,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
852,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
853,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
854,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
855,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
856,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
857,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
858,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
859,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
860,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
861,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
862,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
864,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
866,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
867,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
868,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
869,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
870,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
871,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
872,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
873,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
874,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
875,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
876,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
877,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
878,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
879,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
880,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
881,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
883,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
884,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
885,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
886,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
887,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
889,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
891,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
892,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
893,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."

I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
895,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
896,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
897,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
898,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
899,"I do a lot for my boyfriend's mom. I give her stuff that she wants and sees around my house that I don't need (new things), I drive her places when she asks (not that often maybe a few times a month), I do her nails every so often (I'm qualified in nails). When I was at their house (she lives with her partner), they said they were getting rid of a table. I said I'll have it. And instead of saying ok and letting me have it, they said that'll cost me x amount, which was quite expensive considering what it was and that it was heavily used. I can't believe they wanted to charge me for a table that they were getting rid of anyway. Considering how much I do for her (not so much him as we don't really see each other much). I feel like they have been very stingy and unfair. I just can't get over it. I feel like I do a lot for her and she doesn't do anything back for me (I don't want her to, it's not tit for tat but just saying), and this was her opportunity to do something nice for me. I feel like they tried to milk me for money as they were throwing it out anyway.

They are quite stingy as a family and I really don't like that about them.

Tl;Dr: I do a lot for boyfriend's mom and give her stuff and one day she was getting rid of a table and I wanted it, so she said I have to pay for it."
900,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
901,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
902,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
903,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
904,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
905,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
906,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
907,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
908,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
909,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
910,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
911,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
912,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
913,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
914,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
916,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
917,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
918,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
919,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
920,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
921,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
922,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
923,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
924,"
I(27m) broke up with my girlfriend(27f)  of 4 years 9 months ago. Things got really bad between us before I left and on top of that, I was getting pressured by her parents to either marry her or leave. It was a difficult decision and ultimately I decided to break it off. She was devastated, at the time I thought I was making the right call. For about 6 months she was begging me to reconsider and I was trying to stay strong in my decision. I finally started entertaining the idea of getting back together but when I would start in on the subject with her she would get angry with me and demand apologies.  I couldn’t swallow my pride and admit I had made the mistake. Now here I am a couple months later ready to do all of that and she has just barely started dating and has gone out with this guy for like a week.  We still have been talking this whole time. She says she loves me but isn’t in love with me, and now I’ve flown half way across the country to tell her how much I still love her and how big of a mistake I made and to beg her to take me back.  I’m fully expecting her to deny me but I figured I had nothing to lose if I already lost her so I’m going for it anyway.

TLDR:  broke up with girlfriend of 4 years, finally ready to get back together with her for good but I doubt she will take me back now. Trying anyway."
925,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
926,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
927,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
928,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
929,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
930,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
931,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
932,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
933,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
934,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
935,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
936,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
937,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL;DR - I am planning to take over my student load payments from my parents, and they are upset about it, feeling it is their responsibility even though they can't really afford it and I can."
938,"Hi all, 

Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or anything, I'm really upset and this will be my first post on reddit so I apologize if it doesn't make sense or if this post is too long. Using a throwaway because he's on reddit and knows I lurk on this sub.  
TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
939,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
941,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
942,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
943,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
944,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
945,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
946,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

947,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
948,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

949,"
I(27m) broke up with my girlfriend(27f)  of 4 years 9 months ago. Things got really bad between us before I left and on top of that, I was getting pressured by her parents to either marry her or leave. It was a difficult decision and ultimately I decided to break it off. She was devastated, at the time I thought I was making the right call. For about 6 months she was begging me to reconsider and I was trying to stay strong in my decision. I finally started entertaining the idea of getting back together but when I would start in on the subject with her she would get angry with me and demand apologies.  I couldn’t swallow my pride and admit I had made the mistake. Now here I am a couple months later ready to do all of that and she has just barely started dating and has gone out with this guy for like a week.  We still have been talking this whole time. She says she loves me but isn’t in love with me, and now I’ve flown half way across the country to tell her how much I still love her and how big of a mistake I made and to beg her to take me back.  I’m fully expecting her to deny me but I figured I had nothing to lose if I already lost her so I’m going for it anyway.

TLDR:  broke up with girlfriend of 4 years, finally ready to get back together with her for good but I doubt she will take me back now. Trying anyway."
950,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."

When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
952,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"
953,"
I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
954,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
955,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
956,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
957,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
958,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
959,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
960,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
961,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

Tl;dr Classmate \[22M\] is making me uncomfortable in numerous ways, culminating in taking my lunchbox today. How do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?"
962,"I'm 27F, Daughter. My parents are in their 50s.

To pay for college, I took out a student loan that to-date my parents have been paying for.

My parents are not in good financial shape, and paying down the loan debt is hard on them.

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
964,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
966,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
967,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
968,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
969,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
970,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
971,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
972,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
973,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
974,"
I(27m) broke up with my girlfriend(27f)  of 4 years 9 months ago. Things got really bad between us before I left and on top of that, I was getting pressured by her parents to either marry her or leave. It was a difficult decision and ultimately I decided to break it off. She was devastated, at the time I thought I was making the right call. For about 6 months she was begging me to reconsider and I was trying to stay strong in my decision. I finally started entertaining the idea of getting back together but when I would start in on the subject with her she would get angry with me and demand apologies.  I couldn’t swallow my pride and admit I had made the mistake. Now here I am a couple months later ready to do all of that and she has just barely started dating and has gone out with this guy for like a week.  We still have been talking this whole time. She says she loves me but isn’t in love with me, and now I’ve flown half way across the country to tell her how much I still love her and how big of a mistake I made and to beg her to take me back.  I’m fully expecting her to deny me but I figured I had nothing to lose if I already lost her so I’m going for it anyway.

TLDR:  broke up with girlfriend of 4 years, finally ready to get back together with her for good but I doubt she will take me back now. Trying anyway."
975,"Tl;dr: New friends at school talking shit about my home life. Just want them to stop and leave me alone. 

For context, I moved to the states pretty recently and invited a friend (Steph) from school over. I was pretty nervous cause I live in a two bedroom apartment complex and most of the people I met at school are pretty well off. I’ve been to other people’s houses before, so my mom wanted me to invite someone over to ours.

I really wish I never tried to make friends. I share my room with my little sister, I never saw it as a problem or as unusual before and neither of us have an issue with it, but ever since Steph came over other people have been making fun of me “sleeping with my sister”.

I dont even know why theyre making fun of me but I’m not interested in having friends or keeping these people around. How do I get them to stop saying disgusting things though?

Edit: Sorry for not responding (I had hw) but thank you for all of your thoughtful replies. I didnt realize how hard I was taking it but I was literally crying while reading the responses...and everyone had different life stories! 

1. Sorry if it was confusing, sharing a room always meant one large bed in the room so I didnt even think to clarify that. 
2. I invited her over on Saturday after hanging out with other people and then a mutual friend tagged a picture of me on Sunday on someone’s “food baby” with the caption “OP’s future bf”. 
On Monday at lunch someone asked me about sharing a room with my sister, and how I could live with everyone on top of each other and wasnt it annoying. I tried to let it go. 
What made me write this post was because today during sex ed, a classmate said I shouldn't participate in the robot doll project because I’m a “pedo”. 

Obviously theyre all joking or w/e but I just feel stupid for even trying with these people. They’ll probably forget it by next week, but I dont trust them anymore. So I’ll just take your advice, keep my head down, hope to meet a better group and not invite people to my house anymore."
976,"I was raised by my single mom and I always thought her behavior was normal. She's always ""collected"" things, but I just considered it a quirk of hers. I've been kind of put off by her piles, but lately they've been somewhat contained so I just stay out of her 3 rooms where she keeps her stuff. When I was little, though the piles would go from floor to ceiling in the whole house. About a week ago, however I was talking to a friend about how my mom can't ever find things and my friend asked me why and I told her something along the lines of ""well she has to move her piles"". My friend was super confused by the concept of the piles so I just bit the bullet and brought her into the house to show her. My mom never, ever let me bring anyone into the house but I thought screw it I'm an adult now and she's not home so this can be a secret.

Well my friend looked at me with a really shocked face and said ""your mom's a hoarder.""

This revelation has kind of sent me into a spiral. Now I'm super aware of how much all of her stuff cost. She has probably over $20,000 of clothes, $15,000 of collectibles, and $6,000 of craft supplies, all purchased within the past year and a half. I think she spends well over half of her income on this glorified garbage (sorry to be dramatic). I feel really disgusted. My mom always told me that she couldn't afford the things I wanted (i.e dance classes, a laptop, driving lessons) because we didn't  have the money, but I think she always did. I had to drop out of college because I can't afford it and I'm having a really hard time getting scholarships, but the hoard seems to have a larger monetary value than what I need. I don't want her to spend all of her money on me, but I think there are a lot of better ways to spend it.

I've been just really freaking out about this, so I brought up to my mom that I think I'd like to spend a week or so at a friends house (I didn't tell her why). And now she's really mad at me. She glares whenever she sees me and she said that I could go wherever I want but I might not be welcome back. So now I'm freaked out. 

I don't think I can be in this house any longer but I don't really have an escape route. I have zero money, she overdrafted my bank account until it got shut down. I don't have a car and I can't drive. I have dogs that I refuse to leave with her (she's terrible with animals). I don't have a job right now. I just have no clue what to do. I'm worried about getting a job because with my last job she just spent all of my money. I need to save some so I can get out but my mom always seems to find a way to get a hold of my finances.

Now I'm starting to think that she considers me the ultimate object. She rarely told me growing up that she loves me but she always called me her ""favorite thing"" or her ""best investment"". I really think I'm just a part of the hoard to her.

I feel bad for having these thoughts because I know my mom works hard and I should be grateful for her. But what if I'm just now being clued into something really important?

Sorry to write so much, there's more to unpack but I don't want to weigh you down too much. 
I honestly have no clue what's going on or what to do. Any suggestions? Am I the crazy one? 

TLDR: My mom has a large, expensive hoard and she doesn't seem to want me to be independent. Possibly because I'm an object to her?"
977,"To begin, my husband and I have been together for 15 years, and we have a six year old son. Being as we got together so young, our relationship has been a little rocky at times; but I wouldn't change a second of it. My husband is an incredibly caring and kind person. He loves our son and I deeply, and he would do anything for us. I happily left my academic position when our son was born, while my husband maintains a stable job in IT. 

The reason I'm writing this post is that around a month ago he began behaving a little strangely and I'm starting to worry about him. When he isn't working or sleeping, he's started spending all of his time constructing rafts of various shapes and sizes. Perhaps I should clarify that by rafts I do mean what you would expect: flat wooden structures intended to float on water, like you might see on a TV show. This might seem like a harmless, and honestly quite sweet, passtime (it certainly was at first) but it has become an obsession for my husband, and it's not only affecting our relationship, but his relationship with our son.

We always used to cherish our time together when he wasn't at work. We're lucky enough to have the money to be able to go on frequent days out, taking our son to nature parks and museums and so on. Lately, however, my husband only seems to want to take us out to the local lake, where he will get our son to test out his various rafts. Where we would usually relax together on Sunday mornings, he now spends them in the nearby woods gathering logs from which to construct his rafts. By some miracle, after 15 years we had still managed to maintain a healthy and regular sex life, but now I can tell that even at night his mind is out floating on the lake, and he'll often spend all night researching raft-building techniques, or rigorously documenting his builds on his blog. 

To clarify, I have no real objection to my husband building rafts. It's honestly nice to see him passionate about something; especially something that involves using his hands and spending time outdoors. I think he seems unfulfilled by his office job, and this certainly makes a nice break from that. My worry is how much time this is taking up in his life. Our son is beginning to miss his father, and so am I. I am also worried because I don't think this new hobby is coming from a healthy place. My husband has always had a crippling fear of water, stemming, I think, from a fishing boat accident he was involved in as a child that seriously injured his own father. Just over a month ago our son, much to my husband's dismay, started taking swimming lessons. Am I being too far-fetched in thinking this might have some relation to my husband's obsession with building rafts?

How can I help my husband balance his new hobby with spending time with out family? If I'm right about the connection with his fear of water, should I encourage him to see a therapist, rather than spending copious hours building rafts?

TL;DR - My husband is spending all of his time constructing rafts, and not enough time with our son and I. How can I speak to him about this?"

I'm very much a hobby baker, I’m still learning so I've been practicing by making cakes for friends and family. 

Last year my friend (let’s call her E) asked me for a cake on her birthday and she said she’d pay for it, but I honestly felt bad for charging her because 1. It was her birthday, and 2. I didn’t feel confident the cake would be that good, so I gave it for free. 

Since then I've gifted some more and sold others, but it’s always been my decision when and to whom to offer free baked goods.

Early this year E asked me for 2 cakes for different events and said she’d of course pay. I had a busy month on her second date but I agreed anyway since I like her and there was no issues with cake 1 earlier in the year. Cake 2 was for an event I was invited too and I put a lot of effort and she was super happy when she saw the cake. 

The event was last week and I didn’t hear from her, until yesterday when she wrote me to thank me for the cake again and I told her I was glad she liked it and that she could deposit the payment to my husband since I had problems with my online bank app.

E just said ""how much"" and that was that. I can tell she’s mad, she ignored the messages l sent after, and my husband thinks it’s wrong that I asked her to pay since we were also invited to the event she hosted (where the cake was served) the money is symbolic and pretty meaningless to our bottom line and because she knows I have gifted a lot of cakes to others. But I think that I should be the one to decide when I want to gift my work. If she hadn’t offered to pay I wouldn’t have agreed to make it in the first place because of how busy I knew I'd be or I would have made something simpler. 

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable and if I lost myself a friendship for money I could have easily done without. Is there something I should do to salvage the friendship? 

TL;DR: I charged my friend for a cake I made for a party I also attended and I think she’s mad at me. I’d like to fix it.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit more details that seem to be confusing people, sorry for not being clearer to begin with. 

When she asked me earlier this year for 2 cakes the conversation went (almost) word by word like this: 

- E: Hey, can you bake me 2 cakes for “x” and ""x” dates, I'll of course be paying for them. 

- Me: Sure!, what flavors and for how many people? 

- E: (filling in the details that were almost exactly the same, only the second cake was bigger) 

- Me: Ok, sure. It will be ""x” amount for each even though the second is larger, you get a discount for ordering two at once! Lol. So if that is ok with you I'll be happy to make them.

- E: That is great! Thanks. 

So in my opinion I didn’t suddenly shock her with a bill or a price since she was the one offering to pay and she knew the price of both cakes. Since it all went well with the first cake and she payed me upon delivery, I imagined it would be the same. 

**Edit 2**: For the people wondering how do I know she’s mad. Well, I can’t prove it to you other than to tell you I know. We all know our friends even through text. We know the ones that are stuck to their phone or are chatty, the ones that take a day or two to answer or the ones that are monosyllabic. So you'll just have to believe me (or not) when I say she got mad after I reminded her of my payment. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you all for your replies and I’m reading everything. I will definitely be more assertive and clear in the future. However I will not become a professional with invoices and all that as some suggested. This is my hobby I do for fun, I have no time to make a business out of it (or desire, it can be pretty exhausting). The only reason I started charging was because suddenly I got requests from people I’m barely acquainted with (like my husbands colleagues, friend of a friend), and since I have fun but I can’t afford to go around gifting a ton of bakes, I charge a bit of money, but it’s nowhere near what an actual professional business would."
979,"I love my girlfriend. We've only been dating for about 3 months, but she's the best thing in my life. 

She's extremely close to her family. One of her cousins lives with her on a part-time basis because he's a truck driver. She speaks to her parents everyday. She goes to a family church. They have a family get together almost every Sunday. Through proximity alone, I've met a lot of people in her family.

My family isn't like that. We're spread out over the metroplex. We only see each other on holidays and special events. We love each other, just not like that. My girlfriend has met 2 of my 8 siblings because one lives with me and she accompanied me on vacation with another.  She's starting to get suspicious about why she hasn't met more of them and is demanding to meet my parents.

My dad is a workaholic. He's an extremely nice guy, but a little awkward around new people. I have no problem with her meeting him. My mom, however, is a different story. She was my bully growing up. I was verbally, mentally and physically abused by her as a young child. When I was in my early 20's, I found out she was doing crack. This was after she had lied and stolen from all of us. Then, she disappeared for 3 years and I was happy for her to be gone. When my mom came back, she finally went to rehab - after being forced to under threat of imprisonment (long story) - and got better. I hadn't tried to repair my relationship with her since she returned until recently, but she ruined it by being petty and vindictive.

I love my mom, I really do. But I cannot maintain a relationship with someone toxic. She is the worst thing in my life.

I don't want to introduce the best thing in my life to the worst. I don't want her anywhere near my girlfriend. I don't need my girlfriend to have experience any of the negativity that my mom has inflicted upon our lives.  


My girlfriend is pushing me really hard to meet her. I've explained all of the above and the more personal details to my girlfriend, but she just says stuff like, ""She's still your mom."" - not realizing how toxic that statement is. It's guilting me into having to confront someone out of a forced devotion. But I know my girlfriend means well, which is why I don't blame her. 

How can I get her to understand that meeting my mom is not an option - at least not right now? Or am I wrong to keep her away? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother is a toxic person, a bully and an abuser. I do not want my gf, who I love so much, to meet her but I can't get her to understand."
980,"I don't particularly need it and since I got it for free, it would feel unethical to sell it. She doesn't have a great computer right now so I figure she can get the most use, especially since she likes to play a lot of games with her boyfriend (very LDR). 

I'm questioning myself since I came out of a long-term relationship with someone very insecure, who I'm sure would've had a problem with this. It's been hard for me to determine what's normal, even though I've known her for ~3 years and him for ~10 years.

TL;DR: Wondering if it's awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop.


Edit: I really appreciate all the replies y'all. Being in a toxic relationship ruined my perceptions of things like this so I thought it best to make sure I'm not giving off any ""nice guy"" vibes. 

It's true that she is her own person and can make her own decisions. Anything bad comes of it, it would be her responsibility to ease it with her SO, since all I'm doing is giving it to a friend in need."
981,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in"
982,"I am a student who works as a freelance Spanish tutor for immigrants were I live. 

I have been working with twins (guy, girl) for about two months now. They are from the US and know *some* Spanish but they are doing an intensive course help ahead of the school year and the parents hired me to tutor them.

The mom is American and doesn't speak Spanish but is not learning, the dad is from around here, moved to the US, married, had the kids and came back.

I get along well with both parents.

They are pretty good students, and generally act appropriately, but the girl clearly has a crush on me and makes me a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they take pictures during the classes and they have shared a few of the three of us and they tag me on social media. I don't mind.

After a while, she asked if the girl in my photos was my GF, I replied ""yes"" and she muttered ""lucky"" and giggled. She asks a lot of off-topic personal questions after class (sometimes they give me a dessert or something similar and I stay for a few minutes after class, otherwise I leave pretty much immediately).

She sometimes texts me randomly to ask off-topic stuff or share a photo or something similar.

One time she tried to feed me a piece of fruit with her fork. I said something along the lines of ""don't worry, I have mine right here"" and it was pretty awkward because she obviously enjoys those little flirty interactions and I just want to sink into the floor every time.

Most of the time we are in the living room and the mom is around close by, but other times it's just the maid, the kids and me and those are the most awkward moments for me.

While she hasn't done something downright undeniably inappropriate, she's done enough to be obvious and I don't know what the best approach is.

If I tell the parents it'll be infinitely awkward and might have unpredictable results that I don't know if I want to think about. If I tell her, that'd be secretive and inappropriate, and I don't know how she'll react.

So, I don't know. Should I just keep playing dumb until my time with them is over? Or should I do something particular to handle this?

**tl;dr:** I'm tutoring twins and the girl has a crush on me. Makes comments, texts me, lowkey flirts with me. What should I do to better handle this?"
983,"*Sorry for the weird formatting, I’m mobile and not sure what happened. 

Without getting into too much detail, I was emotionally and physically abused by my father growing up. My mom was nicer but took my dad’s side and refused to believe it was as bad as it was when she wasn’t around. As a result, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. 

          I dealt with it by moving 600 miles away where I met my husband. He is aware of how I grew up and is very patient with my mental health issues. 

          However, over the 17 years since I moved away, my parents haven’t left me alone. They call or text daily, come visit 1-2 times a year, etc. My husband and I tolerated it because they are our kids’ grandparents, and they helped us with money occasionally. 

         Unfortunately, as my kids got older (11g, 11g, 8b) they started to complain that their grandparents are hard to be around because of their constant bickering, which sometimes turns into outright drama. And we no longer need their help financially. 

                    It’s all come to a head recently. Our only bathroom needs extensive work so our house is currently unlivable. We are fighting with the homeowners insurance to cover the repairs, so we’ve essentially been homeless for a month with no end in sight.  In the midst of this incredibly stressful time, my parents decided to “help” by coming to visit. They tasked me with finding an Air bnb that had enough room for them, us, and my sister (37f). Like I don’t have enough going on right now. 

I managed to find a big enough place somewhat close to our house because we go over there every day to check on our cat. My dad decided he didn’t like it for aesthetic reasons and found a place nowhere near our house and much less room, including not enough beds. I acquiesced to keep the peace like I always do. 

My husband is pretty upset at this point, but then last night my mother informs me that guess what, my other sister (35f) is now coming with her two kids! (2b, 7b) No one in our family gets along with her. She’s incredibly selfish and argumentative. She’s slapped me and hit me with objects, as an adult, when I disagreed with her. My husband hates her because she picks fights with him. The last time we were all together was a few years ago and we ended up arguing (I suggested my mom see a doctor since she had fallen twice in two days and they said that was absurd) and my husband had to get between me and her and her husband because he was afraid I would get hurt. I guarantee she’s only coming because she bullied my mother into it because my mother helps her raise her kids. 

My husband refuses to see my family at all while they are here. He got upset last night and said I should tell my parents that this whole thing is too much and I don’t want them to come. Of course he’s my husband and I choose him over them. But in 39 years they’ve never listened to me or changed. He says I should tell them off and be done with it. But that will cause so much drama. My mom will cry and guilt me. My sister will verbally abuse me, at best. I’ll once again be the black sheep that ruins everything. 

How do I find the strength to speak up for myself? What do I even say? I feel like my husband is disappointed in me. He says his just tired of seeing me mistreated, but I don’t know any other way. 

TL;DR My family treats me like shit and my husband insists I stand up for myself but I don’t know how and I’m scared.

EDIT: I’m so thankful for all the responses, even the ones that were harsh. I needed to hear them. A lot of you were super kind and empathetic, which I also needed to hear. 

I showed this post to my husband, and how everyone on Reddit was on his side. We laughed a bit at the comments saying he was going to leave me. He reminded me he knows what he was getting into and he’s in this for the long haul. He said he knows he’s not perfect and people were commenting only knowing one side. 

We’ve made a plan together to stand up as a team when my parents and sisters come visit. Neither of us will stay at the Air bnb and we’ll protect our kids from the toxicity by not leaving them alone with them at all. Once they go back home, we plan to go no or low contact. 

I have downloaded the recommended books and plan to try to find a good therapist. I need to protect my chosen family and this is the catalyst I needed to work harder on my marriage and family."
984,"We have been happily married for 3 years, together for 8, and have a pretty decent life. I love my job, we both make decent salaries and rent a nice place.

I was always on the fence about kids. This was pretty clear early in our relationship. A few months into dating she said if we wanted to continue, I had to be willing to have kids. I always thought that it would be whatever my wife wanted and I told her that. I was pretty indifferent to the idea of kids, but I could see myself as a good father. I always play with kids and have fun doing it. We continued to date, had a wonderful time, and got married.

My wife is a great person, and I don't know anyone else that I would rather be with. She is beautiful, smart, and responsible. Yeah, passion has faded, but we still are both willing to have sex when someone initiates, although that has dropped in frequency in recent years.

Once marriage settled in, and the talks about kids begun. I started to really think about children and it started to weigh on me very heavily. I admitted to my wife that I wasn't ready, and didn't know if I ever would be. During this tough talk, through tears, she said that she loved me and that if I didn't want kids we couldn't be together. I really love her and told her that I would talk to some people about their experience to try to get a different perspective. I talked to a few dads and I felt good for a little while, everything seemed to be back on track. Those feelings are starting to balloon again and I'm to the point where I feel like I can't go through with it.

In my head, I see so many negatives. Money, Time, effort, etc. Every time I see a family, I see tired, irritated parents. I have a lot of friends who are dads too. I always think, ""These people would be way happier without kids."" The whole argument of moments and seeing your kid grow and learn doesn't appeal to me. It's such a touchy subject to say you regret having kids and I don't think most people could bring themselves to give me a truthful opinion.

If I stay, I will have a child and I know it will be hard. I think I could do it, and don't think I could leave a kid to a broken home. That would be the absolute worst situation and is a reality I hope I never have to think about. Overall, I think I would be a good father. I do like playing with kids, but I usually can give them back. I sincerely hope that some sort of instinct kicks in and I would love the child unconditionally and not regret it for the next (at least) couple of years. I will be one of those tired, irritated parents that I see who put themselves through such crazy hardships for so little reward.

If I go, that's divorce and everything that is included, except there aren't kids or a house, the two largest issues. I ruin my wife's life, and she is concerned with her age and having children. Starting over at 31 would be so hard for her. I would also lose a good deal of my wife's friends and her amazing family, which I like better than my own. I will be back in the dating pool, which is scary in itself. I would love to feel sparks and passion again, and I think I will have some luck but what if I don't find someone as good? I could be unhappy and lonely for who knows how long.

I fear that life will never be this good again. Either choice is difficult and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love the way life is now, but I said early on in my wife and I's relationship that I would have a child.  I have changed my mind and I don't know what to do."
985,"I like my friend, but I'm a bit weirded out by her request. I don't have kids, so maybe this is just a normal kids thing? 

The background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job, and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work. I guess she and her son have had concert tickets for tomorrow night for awhile. 

She lives about 30-45 minutes from work during rush hour, and I live 5 minutes away. She said her son doesn't want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain, and she wants to stay at the happy hour as long as possible so she doesn't want to drive home after and pick him up. so asked if he could stay here. 

When I asked her how long, she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up ""whenever happy hour was over, probably around 7 pm"". Except our work happy hours never end that early, so it won't be 7 pm. If she really has a concert that night, I expect she will end up leaving as late as possible, but trying to make the concert on time. 

I said yes, because I was taken by surprise over the phone, and also because there's also probably no way I would tell someone that I wont let their kid shelter in my house. 

However, I feel weird about it! I told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work, and she said it was fine, he entertained himself, and to just put him in front of the TV. 

Is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house, with someone they have never met, for 12 hours? Where they will be alone for like 6 hours and awkwardly interacting with us for the other 5? I feel like instead she should just:

1) leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home, or
2) get an Uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert, or 
3) I dunno, reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn't going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after? Like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she's had these concert tickets?

I know it's probably too late, and either way, it's not this kids fault so of course he can stay, I would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever. But I feel weird about this situation!! I'd really like other opinions.

TL;DR: should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hours because his mom doesn't want to leave happy hour early?

Edit: editing the post to include the info that I've never met the son. Also, she does have a history of doing kind of weird things like this. She once asked me if she could stay with me for 2 weeks because she needed a break from her other, older son. I said no."
986,"I'm currently taking a once a week class in college. This is a large lecture hall class, and there is one guy who sits near me that I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first two weeks he spent most of the time before class and during the midway break complaining about how hard it was to keep up with all the work in the program. Some of the classes he's taking now, I've taken before. So I walked him through the structure of one of the classes he was most stressed about and gave him some strategies to tackle the subject. I feel like this is where I went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, our interactions have started to make me very uncomfortable. He's asked a lot of probing questions about what I do outside of class. During week 3 or 4 he told me how mad he was at the people grading in our class, started swearing about them and half shouting, and I just went silent. A minute or two later, he switched to all smiles, as if nothing happened, but starting again with probing questions. I have also caught him staring fixated at me in the cafeteria while he's waiting for an elevator. I find myself purposely getting to class right on time and stepping out during breaks just to avoid him.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few weeks, he's slowly moved his seat closer and closer to mine (very few people sit in the second row). When I got in today, he had his seat next to mine, so I noped out and sat in another row.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that prompted me to write this post today is I went to talk to the professor right after class, walking up to the front with everything except my lunchbox. When I was done, the guy and my lunch box were gone. I then get an email from him (I've never given him my email) and told me I left it behind today. This is setting off all alarm bells in my head.

I'll be honest, he seems to be awkward socially. My question is how do I convey I'm creeped out tactfully?

I am now in a position to take the loan debt payments on myself.

Unfortunately, my parents see themselves as responsible and feel some level of pride at paying my loan debt, even though it makes their financial situation problematic.

As the debt is technically in my name, I am planning on taking over payments.

Am I wrong for doing this given how upset it will make them (more embarrassed I think than anything else)? They believe it is their responsibility even though it's more difficult for them to afford than me.

TL; DR at the bottom of post

As the title states, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of one year. I think I just mostly need to vent, or hear some nice words of encouragement because I'm completely tore up about this and the people on here are so nice. Last night I found out that over the weekend while I was at my best friend's bachelorette party, my bf was also at our mutual friends bachelor party the same weekend and he was caught using Tinder by my other friend who was also at the same bachelor party. After being confronted and initially denying the accusation, my bf finally fessed up to it. Apparently nothing happened, but this isn't the first instance where I've caught him disrespecting the boundaries of our relationship.

Early on, about three months in I caught him messaging another girl talking about threesomes and requesting nudes, I'm not sure how long their messaging went, but it was a huge thing between us. Steadily, he tried to gain trust but I always felt like I put more into the relationship, and I know that's my mistake. I would go over to his house and clean without being asked, would surprise him with food when I could, cook for him, and generally made more of an effort to see him than me.

We talked on the phone after the initial blow up last night and he kept apologizing, saying he's a fuck up and I'm the best relationship he's ever had, and he knows I won't get back with him but to know it's not me. I just can't help but feel pathetic and stupid and like I'm not enough, and that's what hurts. And I know I'm dumb to expect him to actually care because last night after it all went down he went out with his friends to go drink.   
Oh, and he was on Tinder the same weekend my grandpa was hospitalized (which was the hardest thing, I cut my trip short with my friends to visit him) who my bf knows is now dying, and he still chose to go on Tinder. I'm just really, really hurt. 

It just sucks, I put so much into this relationship and ending was the best decision, but I'm not sure how someone can be in your life and truly show they don't care.  Sorry, I know a year isn't a lot compared to the issues and relationships some people have here, but I just had to get this off my chest. 

TL; DR: Caught boyfriend on Tinder same weekend my grandpa is dying. We broke up, but I just need to hear some nice words and encouragement."
989,"I and my boyfriend have been together almost five years. This is by far the longest relationship I’ve ever had - to be honest, the only real one. He has always been more of a homebody, happy to stay in the small town we grew up in, but I despise this place. I am desperate to move away to somewhere vibrant and full of life with actual career options. This means a lot to me.

My boyfriend initially said recently he would move with me but now claims he does not remember that conversation and will not go. He asked me “why should I be the one who has to move”.

I understand how he feels and respect that he can make his own choice. I’m not calling him unreasonable. But I know I cannot ignore my own needs any longer. I’m terrified of losing him but I’m also terrified of stagnating in unhappiness for longer and longer while I ignore my dreams and my goals.

But I’m so so scared of regretting my choice. I love him and I need him and I’m scared of what I will be alone. Especially since I have no good family and no real friends, no support network at all to speak of.

TL;DR: I have to choose between a five year relationship and the man I love, and the career and life I want to strive towards - what should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post though!

So since then, quite a few things have happened. We had started counselling, where she got us to read the 5 Love Languages. I'm not a reader, but it was a pretty easy book to read and helped a lot. We were speaking completely different love languages and explained why we were getting frustrated with each other. Things on that front was so much better. We also addressed the issue around her ""friend"" and she challenged us both on why were were feeling the way we were feeling. She said that I gave him too much power and credit, which looking back, I completely agree with. She told my SO, that he was basically using and taking advantage of her good nature and ask what she was getting out of the friendship. She said it was purely friendship as they liked very similar things, and that he felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I got annoyed and where I may have crossed a line. Prior to the session, I had asked her a few times if he was flirty or said anything really inappropriate. She kept denying it saying that they were just friends and that if anything was inappropriate, it was a joke. I also admitted to her that saying directly that I wanted him out of our lives was wrong and I shouldn't have gone about it that way. But even with this, I didn't quite believe her and I looked into their messenger history without her knowing. I still feel sick that I had to go behind her back and look, but felt that I wasn't getting the truth and needed to really know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The unfortunate thing was that I was right. He had sent continuous messages and screenshots of her, saying how pretty and cute she was. That in itself is bad, but he had also said that he wish she was single and joked about making out with her, after knowing that I had been having panic attacks about him hitting on her. So in the second counselling session, I was initially told that all the issues in the relationship was my fault and I had a lot to work on. This is where I said I disagreed and said I looked at her messages and found the content I was worried about. The counsellor then changed her tone. I said that even when he said inappropriate things, my SO either ignored the comment, or laughed about it. She says she couldn't remember any of those messages and I said I took pictures of them, and would send them later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did, and I didn't quite get the reaction I was thinking I'd get. She admitted that saying she should be single and making out was inappropriate. But all the other times he said something flirty, she said it was taken out of context. Now shes annoyed that I looked at her messages, but glad that I admitted it. She then admitted there was a time where ""he was interested in her"" when she previously told me he wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just trying to make sense of the situation. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right, and I apologised for looking into her messages. I know that it will be hard for her to trust me again, but having said that, she had lied or concealed information also. I just don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I looked into my SO messages and found what I suspected. Now she is saying that I have a wrong or skewed view on trust."
991,"Hello, last night I had a one night stand hookup with a, so i thought great guy. I neck kissed him for a little bit, not sucking too hard, and accidentally left a knocker of a hickey. He texted me after, panicking a little bit because he had never really dealt with a hickey and i gave him some pointers. Totally normal. Wake up this morning to him being very passive aggressive saying things like “Never do this again. This is very inconsiderate of you” etc over and over again. I apologized profusely and even venmo’d him for concealer and aloe vera. Even after I tried to settle things and leave him alone, he brought it up to lecture me again about. It’s this cycle of him passively yelling at me and me just apologizing over and over again. Is this normal? Brings a weird feeling to my stomach.


TL;DR? : Accidentally gave a hookup a hickey, apologized profusely and continued to receive passive aggressive lectures from said hookup."
992,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. 

For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Also, when I told my mum about what he'd been doing, she made me swear not to tell anyone about it. I have told my closest friends, but I wasn't allowed to tell family why he moved out, I had to lie with her.

Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. 

I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. 

Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it? I also have clinical depression, social anxiety and am on the Autism Spectrum, so whilst I am 22 now, I still have to live with my mum as I can't cope on my own. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have no idea what to do about still feeling uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: My mums boyfriend acted inappropriately with me, mum forgave him, let him move back in and now downplays and tries to blame me for what happened. Still feel uncomfortable and don't really know what to do about this"
993,"Quick background, we've had a great relationship for years now -- this girl is smart, cute, and above all, great to talk to. We recently moved in together and share a bed in a 1 bed apartment. We have a nice split of chores -- I suck at cooking, so she does most of it on Sundays, and I do most of the cleaning, laundry, dishes, and other odd jobs. We make about the same amount of money so shared expenses are split 50/50.

She's an extremely light sleeper. At first, I didn't necessarily want to go to bed at the same time as her (I'm a heavy sleeper and need a bit less than her), but the creaky floor when I attempted to sneak into bed always woke her up (despite earplugs). I compromised and now I just stay in bed on my phone until I'm ready to sleep. I'd rather not, but relationships are compromises I guess. She also regularly ""has anxiety"" before bed, usually about work. I try to calm her and have suggested maybe she should see a professional, but she refuses as she has not had good experiences with therapy before.

She works longer hours and has a slightly longer commute, so we agreed she commutes with my car (she doesn't have one). I cover the car payments, and registration fees, she covers fuel and most of insurance -- it's a reasonable arrangement. Naturally this means I take public transport, which I don't mind, but it does mean I HAVE to be out of bed at a certain time, or else I have to wait another hour to catch public transport. There's an earlier option for me to take that I might prefer, but my alarm would wake her up before she usually leaves, so I usually end up taking the later option.

One night, I made an insensitive joke. Self-deprecating jokes about weight gain are pretty frequent between us, so when she got a craving, I said ""This is why you're fat!"", thinking it was innocuous insult comedy as she has said similar things to me -- I made it a little too blunt though. It was wrong and I realized that in retrospect and apologized later that night once she pointed out it was a sensitive topic. Despite this, evidently she'd had some built up emotions and started yelling at me about how I don't care about her, I don't love her, I'm selfish, I don't listen to her. How I deprive her of sleep because I steal the blankets, I accidentally wake her up in my sleep. How I'm not affectionate enough and give her ""literally 1 hug a day"" when she gets home from work (which I don't think is true at all, she only says this on days that I happen to be less affectionate on). I'm not very engaging or heated in arguments so most of the time I stayed silent -- I think that pissed her off more. We were losing sleep at this point and she said she couldn't sleep because she was ""so fucking mad"" at me. Eventually calmed down and I apologized so we went to sleep after about 1-2 hours of this.

Later that night I woke up in the early morning feeling cold as she had most of the sheets, so I pulled some back as gently as I could. Of course, this woke her up anyways. She quietly said ""you woke me up"" and then got angrier until she started yelling at me again about how I'm selfish and we should have had separate blankets and now she's going to be miserable all day because of me and she can't go back to sleep as easily as me. Except, we did want to do separate blankets, but she didn't like the texture of the spare one -- neither did I. I said ""ok now is not a good time to have this discussion we can resolve this after we bear with it and get some sleep"" and reassured her that I do, in fact, care about her, or else why would I bother engaging her. She said she was deliberately keeping me awake (violently pulling the blankets off of me) so I would pay attention and listen to her because apparently I never do. After an hour of further mental breakdown, I apologized and we sort of went back to sleep.

The sleep issue is easy to fix, I'll just get some damn better separate blankets. I even suggested separate beds but she just said ""then we'll never spend time together"". As if we don't spend time together for a couple hours like every day? I just am beginning to wonder... life was so much easier living on my own -- is it normal to compromise this much? I feel like we operate on her schedule (we get up on hers, we eat dinner when she gets home, we shower and go to bed when she decides to), so what am I missing here? Since we've moved in, this isn't the first time she's started yelling at me over bottled up issues.

Do take this with a grain of salt as I'm sure my side of the story is biased.

tl;dr gf has some underlying feelings and thoughts that I am disrespectful and take her for granted. I feel like I am compromising and she isn't."
994,"Is it an issue for you if your significant other is quiet/shy and has a hard time meeting new people such as your friends and family? I'm a 29M and am pretty talkative around my SOs but in group settings or with people I don't know, I am very quiet. This has been an issue for my previous two girlfriends (24Fs), both of who have dumped me and claimed this as a reason. Wondering how important this is to people. I dated each girl for around 9 months.

TLDR: is it a dealbreaker for you if your SO is quiet/shy around new people other than you?"
995,"I'm sorry if this is kind of complicated to explain.

My mother grew up with a father that she had issues with. I don't know details. All I know is that she estranged herself from her parents.

When I was growing up, I always felt alienated in my own house. I was always told that I wasn't very smart, or that I was overweight, and that I needed to work on being ""a better person"". I got in trouble often, over seemingly trivial things. One of my issues is something that happened a while ago, but it still kind of leaves a mark, because she won't admit that anything happened. When I was ten I was very depressed. I went to school at home so I never had friends. Mainly it was because I felt very trapped because I never left the house and my mother would always glare at me and complain about me, and say that I was a terrible person when I wasn't in the room. (things she still does today). But at ten, I was suicidal, and it concerned me. So I told her, and she screamed at me for 2 hours telling me that I didn't have the right to feel that way, because she has given me a ""perfect life"". I feel as though I never recovered from that. I never talk to my family about my personal issues, as it usually leads to screaming at worst, or rants behind my back at best. Recently she tells me that she wishes I would go to college out of state so that I could ""become a different person"" so that she could want me as her son again. Despite the fact that she won't let me go to college out of state.  Also, I was switching from home school to online charter. Still at home. She told me that I would fail and get D's and F's, but I now rank number 3 in my class. But I guess that isn't as good as she was.

Recently though, she has admitted that she has treated me differently than my female siblings for my entire life because she doesn't like men. She believes that all men want to take advantage of women. She doesn't like me because I am male. Well, she admits this, and then tells me that as her child, I must be able to handle the issues of her childhood, so that she can feel better. She says she will still treat me like this, but that now that I know, I can ""deal with it better"". Members of my family know about her issues, and her constant complaining, but they won't do anything because of her getting angry. She says she is always correct in her judgement because she is smarter than everyone else in this household combined. 

It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I don't want to blame her for anything, but at the same time it is hard to deal with her emotional weight from growing up. I am sorry if I have written this in a way that was wrong. These things have just left me in a weird head space.

TLDR: My mother has admitted to treating me differently than my siblings because of her issues with men that originated during her childhood."
996,"Today is 19 months for us and we started doing it consistently around 2 or 3 months ago. I am so bad at it. I’ve been able to please her other ways for the first 17 months of our relationship, but not when it comes to actual sex. I always finish way too early and it destroys me every time and it doesn’t feel good anymore. It makes me happy when we do other stuff like oral because I can actually satisfy her, but now sex makes me scared and anxious. She really wants to do it more and says she still enjoys it even though she doesn’t finish, but I just wish I could do more for her.
Also, I wish I was a girl and I’ve let slip some hints on accident and she has asked me about it in the past but I always dent it. I want to be with her, so I figure I will have to let her know eventually, so how do I do that? Does this desire to a girl/lesbian impact my sexually performance too?
This is probably a lot at this point, but ever since all my friends betrayed me and told me they hated me, I’ve been having extreme episodes of sadness? I don’t think I have depression or anything but like this whole week has been one which has kinda led me to asking reddit about this. Could this also be a cause to my problems?
I just have no idea what to do at this point. My parents are really religious and shouldn’t be having sex or be thinking about wanting to be a different gender and yet here I am and I have literally no clue what to do. I don’t think any of them even had reddit but I created this account just to post this privately just in case. I’m very new to all of this including reddit and I just want help. What do I do to make myself feel better?

TL:DR i wish I was a girl, I get really sad about that and my past, I think that’s impacting my sexual performance, and I need help"
997,"Hi all. Long time by stander and commenter but first time poster. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and things seem just fine . But sometimes I feel as if something does switch. And I don't know how to handle it.

Just this morning , as we woke up, she immediately started crying saying she is going to miss me and that she can't wait to get home so we can be together again. She mostly missed me because she could not sleep last night and was up until 2 am ( even when we went to bed early because she was tired ) so I immediately woke up feeling guilty because I fell asleep.  

The thing is, this isn't the first time, or even the first time this week. This happens roughly 2 to 3 times a week. 

I feel resentment because I don't think I should feel guilty. And she feels misunderstood. 


Should I feel selfish for.not understanding what she means by she already misses me ? 

Should I feel guilty because she feels like I deserted her when I fell asleep? 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks ! 

Tldr : girlfriend wakes up crying saying she misses me because she was up until 2 am and we didn't spend any time together."
998,"I've dated a ton, even had a couple relationships last over a year. But I never really felt that mutual spark. There were always doubts in my mind. One guy I did really love, but I knew it wouldn't work long term.

I've now been out 4 times with the most ""perfect for me"" guy. I'm 100% honeymooning and totally infatuated. I've never met someone who is on such a similar wavelength. We've already spoken a bit about what we're looking for in a relationship. We seem very compatible. We can talk all night and it feels like we've known each other forever. We've already agreed we're not seeing anyone else. (Early for exclusivity but we're having sex)

I'm losing my mind during the day thinking of him(just normal infatuation stuff) and also trying to stay kind of cool, though we're both open that this is really good.

How do I keep this going well? How do I stay productive?

TL;DR: First time in love as an adult, how do I stay productive, keep the relationship going well, and get through infatuation?"
999,"
I(27m) broke up with my girlfriend(27f)  of 4 years 9 months ago. Things got really bad between us before I left and on top of that, I was getting pressured by her parents to either marry her or leave. It was a difficult decision and ultimately I decided to break it off. She was devastated, at the time I thought I was making the right call. For about 6 months she was begging me to reconsider and I was trying to stay strong in my decision. I finally started entertaining the idea of getting back together but when I would start in on the subject with her she would get angry with me and demand apologies.  I couldn’t swallow my pride and admit I had made the mistake. Now here I am a couple months later ready to do all of that and she has just barely started dating and has gone out with this guy for like a week.  We still have been talking this whole time. She says she loves me but isn’t in love with me, and now I’ve flown half way across the country to tell her how much I still love her and how big of a mistake I made and to beg her to take me back.  I’m fully expecting her to deny me but I figured I had nothing to lose if I already lost her so I’m going for it anyway.

TLDR:  broke up with girlfriend of 4 years, finally ready to get back together with her for good but I doubt she will take me back now. Trying anyway."
